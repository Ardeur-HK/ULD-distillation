Based on these results and other recent trials identifying issues with SSC methodology, it is time to find a better physiologic surrogate measure for hot flashes.", "prediction_text": "The SSC device is a reasonable surrogate for hot flash measurement, but the first prototype was not able to collect any analyzable skin conductance data owing to various malfunction issues, including poor conductance and battery failure. The second prototype was able to collect 24% concordance rate between self-reported and device-recorded hot flashes."}
{"answers": ": Prophylactic fixation with a cephalomedullary nail was not found to be cost-effective for the average older woman who sustained a hip fracture. However, it may be appropriate for select patient populations. The study supports the need for basic science and clinical trials investigating the effectiveness of prophylactic fixation for patient populations at higher lifetime risk for contralateral hip fracture.", "prediction_text": "Prophylactic fixation of the uninjured hip is cost-effective in preventing contralateral hip fractures in women 71 to 75 years old with a 30% greater risk of a contralateral fracture. The cost-effectiveness is greater than $50,000 per QALY gained."}
{"answers": "We found that USMLE Step 2, number of honors in medical school clerkships, and AOA membership demonstrated the strongest correlations with resident performance. Our goal in analyzing these data was to provide residency programs at large a sense of which criteria may be \"high yield\" in ranking applicants by analyzing data from within our own pool of residents. Similar studies across a broader scope of programs are warranted to confirm applicability of our findings. The continually emerging complexities of the field of orthopaedic surgery lend increasing importance to future work on the appropriate selection and training of orthopaedic residents.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that residency selection criteria are associated with objective measures of resident performance and subjective ratings by faculty."}
{"answers": "In vitro fertilization outcome is strongly correlated with both maternal ages, basal cycle, day 3 follicle, stimulated hormone, and antral follicle assessment. Antral follicle assessment was a better predictor of in vitro fertilization outcome than were age or follicle stimulated hormone.

{"answers": "Although elevated leukocyte count and CRP value cannot effectively establish the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the elderly, unelevated values exclude it. Accordingly, appendectomy is not recommended to be performed in an elderly patient with unelevated leukocyte count and CRP value, although clinical symptoms and signs indicate acute appendicitis.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that leukocyte count and CRP measurements are not useful in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the elderly."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrates that in patients at risk for cardiac morbidity undergoing vascular surgery, desflurane is effective to control intraoperative hypertension without fear of major cardiac depressant effect.", "prediction_text": "Desflurane does not alter left ventricular function when used to control intraoperative hypertension during aortic surgery."}
{"answers": "Development of tolerance to gluten seems possible in some patients with CD. Further follow-up will show whether this tolerance is permanent or only a long-term return to latency. This feature may be associated with genetic characteristics, especially with HLA genotypes that differ from DQ2 or DQ8. More insight into the mechanisms of the development of gluten tolerance may help to distinguish those CD patients that might not require life-long GFD.", "prediction_text": "The majority of adult patients with biopsy-proven CD for more than 10 years are capable of developing tolerance to gluten. The presence of HLA-DQ2/DQ8 negative patients with a gluten-free diet is associated with a higher risk of osteoporosis."}
{"answers": "No home-prepared replacement milks in South Africa meet all estimated micronutrient and essential fatty acid requirements of infants aged<6 months. Commercial infant formula is the only replacement milk that meets all nutritional needs. Revisions of WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF HIV and infant feeding course replacement milk options are needed. If replacement milks are to provide total nutrition, preparations should include vegetable oils, such as soybean oil, as a source of linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids, and additional vitamins and minerals.", "prediction_text": "The present study does not support the recommendation of the 2001 feeding recommendations for infants of HIV-infected mothers for a rural region in KwaZulu Natal, South Africa."}

{"answers": "Laparoscopic procedures caused detectable damage to Kupffer and endothelial cells as reflected by elevation of post-operative HA serum levels. The damage to the liver hepatocytes and perisinusoidal cells has no clinical significance and the laparoscopic procedure itself is the probable cause of the Kupffer and endothelial cells damage, while other mechanisms caused damage to the hepatocytes.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that laparoscopic cholecystectomy may have a negative effect on peri-sinusoidal cell activity."}
{"answers": "Sleep disorders are common in the general adult population of Japan. Correction for reporting heterogeneity using anchoring vignettes is not a necessary tool for proper management of sleep and energy related problems among Japanese adults. Older age, gender differences in communicating sleep-related problems, the presence of multiple morbidities, and regular exercise should be the focus of policies and clinical practice to improve sleep and energy management in Japan.", "prediction_text": "Yes, adjustment for reporting heterogeneity is necessary in sleep disorders. This is because the present study found that the magnitude of the regression coefficients after adjustment for reporting heterogeneity was slightly different from that of the ordered probit model."}
{"answers": "Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is often challenging in men on account of more adhesions and inflammation. This leads to higher conversion rates and more postoperative complications.

{"answers": "These results suggest that quantitative real-time PCR assays for BCRABL detection can be comparable between laboratories despite significant differences in methodologies if the same positive control cell line and quality control gene are used. It is imperative that some level of assay standardization be adopted between laboratories, not only for patients who are monitored at different facilities, but also for larger investigative studies in which hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular responses are to be compared.", "prediction_text": "The results of this study suggest that BCRABL transcript detection by quantitative real-time PCR is possible and correlated between laboratories. However, the discordant result in one patient with a low BCRABL copy number may be due to a minimal RNA yield at one laboratory."}
{"answers": "Although the exact mechanism of SSDH in this case is unclear, we speculate that this SSDH was a hematoma that migrated from the intracranial subdural space. Low CSF pressure because of continuous drainage and intrathecal thrombolytic therapy may have played an important role in the migration of the hematoma through the spinal canal. It is important to recognize the SSDH as a possible complication of the SAH accompanied with intracranial subdural hematoma.", "prediction_text": "The patient's symptoms were related to the subdural hematoma and not to the aneurysm. The hematoma resolved spontaneously and the patient was discharged without neurologic deficits."}

{"answers": "These data indicate that major blunt trauma enhances the migratory capacity of circulating neutrophils. This is manifest within 2 hrs of admission and may be attributable to alteration in interleukin-8 receptor expression, affinity, or downstream signaling. In patients who later develop ARDS, initially elevated circulating neutrophil counts decrease rapidly, over the same time course. Early enhanced neutrophil migratory activity coupled with elevated pulmonary concentrations of interleukin-8 may be central to the establishment of the neutrophil infiltration that is characteristic of ARDS.", "prediction_text": "Neutrophil migration in response to interleukin-8 is elevated in the lung of major trauma patients within 2 hrs of injury and may play a central role in the recruitment of neutrophils to the lung and their subsequent activation. This may be a crucial factor in the etiology of ARDS."}
{"answers": "Memory provocation increased the sensitivity of rCBF-SPECT for the detection of AD-related blood flow changes in the brain at the group level. Further studies are needed to evaluate MP-SPECT as a diagnostic tool at the individual level. If a higher sensitivity for AD at the individual level is verified in future studies, a single MP-SPECT study might be sufficient in the clinical setting.", "prediction_text": "The use of memory-provoked rCBF-SPECT may be a useful tool in the differential diagnosis of AD, but further studies are needed to confirm its diagnostic value."}

{"answers": "These data suggest that either apoptosis is not involved in cell loss in MTS, or a very slow rate of cell demise may have precluded detecting TUNEL-positive neurons dying through apoptosis. Increased Bax expression and activation of caspases support the latter possibility.", "prediction_text": "The present study does not support the hypothesis that the cell death in mesial temporal sclerosis is apoptotic."}
{"answers": "Golytely was more efficacious than MiraLAX in bowel cleansing, and was independently associated with both bowel prep quality (BBPS \u2265 7) and higher adenoma detection. Golytely should be used as first line for bowel prep for colonoscopy. Studies with larger populations are needed to confirm these results.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that Golytely is more efficacious than MiraLAX in detecting adenomas in average risk screening colonoscopies."}
{"answers": "Patient's age (>60 y) and large polyp size (>10 mm) were significant predictive factors for neoplastic GB polyps. GB polyps less than 10 mm in diameter do not require surgical intervention simply because they grow.", "prediction_text": "The growth rate of a gallbladder polyp is not a reliable predictor for a neoplastic polyp."}
{"answers": "These data suggest that the R14C KCNQ1 mutation alone is insufficient to cause AF. Rather, we suggest a model in which a \"second hit\", such as an environmental factor like hypertension, which promotes atrial stretch and thereby unmasks an inherited defect in ion channel kinetics (the \"first hit\"), is required for AF to be manifested. Such a model would also account for the age-related increase in AF development.", "prediction_text": "This study suggests that stretch-sensitive KCNQ1 mutations may be a link between genetic and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of AF."}
{"answers": "The real-time PCR approach revealed promising results in pollen identification and quantification, even when analyzing pollen mixes.

{"answers": "The incidence of CPM is not increased in IVF/ICSI pregnancies compared with spontaneous conceptions. CPM probably does not account for the adverse perinatal outcomes following IVF/ICSI.", "prediction_text": "The incidence of CPM in IVF/ICSI pregnancies is lower than in spontaneous conceptions. This may be due to the influence of ovarian stimulation on the chromosomal constitution of the embryos which could be translated into localized chromosomal anomalies in the placenta."}
{"answers": "For risk stratification in emergency surgical patients, it is essential to measure the APACHE II score before surgical treatment. Longitudinal APACHE II scoring reveals continuous improvement of the score in surviving patients but has no therapeutic relevance in the individual patient.", "prediction_text": "The APACHE II score is not a reliable marker of physiological impairment in emergency surgical patients. It is not independent of the effects of treatment and might lead to considerable bias in the comparability of defined groups of patients and in the evaluation of treatment policies. Postoperative monitoring with the APACHE II score is clinically irrelevant. Inception cohort study. Secondary referral center. Eighty-five consecutive emergency surgical patients admitted to the surgical ICU in 1999. The APACHE II score was calculated before surgery; after admission to the ICU; and on postoperative days 3, 7, and 10. APACHE II scores and predicted and observed mortality rates. The mean +/- SD APACHE II score of 24.2 +/- 8."}
{"answers": "The methodologic weaknesses of the studies do not permit acceptance of increased risk of tubal pregnancy or infertility as a consequence of perforation of the appendix, so a causal relationship cannot be supported by the data currently available. Only a well-designed case-control study with unbiased ascertainment of exposure and adjustment for confounding variables will provide a definitive answer.", "prediction_text": "Perforation of the appendix is a risk factor for tubal infertility and ectopic pregnancy."}
{"answers": "Cancellous bone plays an important role in primary stability of mini-implants in the presence or absence of cortical bone.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that trabecular bone properties are related to primary stability of miniscrews in the presence of cortical bone.

{"answers": "Survivors of lobar ICH with atrial fibrillation should not be offered long-term anticoagulation. Similarly, most patients with deep hemispheric ICH and atrial fibrillation should not receive anticoagulant therapy. However, patients with deep hemispheric ICH at particularly high risk for thromboembolic stroke or low risk of ICH recurrence might benefit from long-term anticoagulation.", "prediction_text": "In the absence of data from a clinical trial, we used a decision-analysis model to compare the expected values of 2 treatment strategies-warfarin and no anticoagulation-for such patients. We used a Markov state transition decision model stratified by location of hemorrhage (lobar or deep hemispheric) and a decision tree to estimate the risk of thromboembolic stroke. Data sources included English language literature identified through MEDLINE searches and bibliographies from selected articles, along with empirical data from our own institution. The base case focused on a 69-year-old man with a history of ICH and newly diagnosed nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. For patients with prior lobar ICH, withholding anticoagulation therapy"}

{"answers": "In summary we believe sudden onset chest wall rigidity may be a significant and previously unreported factor leading to an increased mortality, from illicit IV fentanyl use. Fentanyl and norfentanyl ratios and concentrations suggest a more rapid onset of death given the finding of fentanyl without norfentanyl in many of the fatalities. Chest wall rigidity may help explain the cause of death in these instances, in contrast to the typical opioid-related overdose deaths. Intravenous heroin users should be educated regarding this potentially fatal complication given the increasingly common substitution and combination with heroin of fentanyl.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that chest wall rigidity may be a factor in rapid death from illicit fentanyl abuse."}

However, for larger tumors ultrasound can be a useful addition to physical examination by delineating reliably the anatomic relations of the tumor to structures such as the tunica albuginea, corpus cavernosum, and urethra.", "prediction_text": "Ultrasound in the evaluation of the extent and invasion of squamous cell carcinoma of the penis is a useful addition to clinical staging."}
{"answers": "This study confirms that a large percentage of patients use metered-dose inhalers improperly. It also demonstrates a significant lack of understanding by health care providers of the proper use of metered-dose inhalers. Furthermore, this study supports the use of respiratory care practitioners in the outpatient setting, since they were the most proficient among all the health care providers in the proper use of metered-dose inhalers.", "prediction_text": "The present study does not support the recommendation of the proper use of metered-dose inhalers by health care providers and patients."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrated that the regional or global apex of a given curve is the most rotated level in only a minority of the curves. The most rotated level may be as far as two levels from the global apex and one level from the regional apex.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that the most rotated vertebral level is not always located at the apex, and that the regional and global apexes are not always coincident."}
{"answers": "Generalization of the RCT sample was supported, because only 7.8% of Phenomenology subjects did not fit the RCT criteria. Nevertheless, because the RCT subjects were more severely ill, it is unclear if treatment findings from the RCT will be applicable to children with less severe mania.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that the RCT sample is representative of the general population of children with child bipolar I disorder. The present study also suggests that the RCT sample is representative of the general population of children with child bipolar I disorder."}
{"answers": "Experts across Europe asserted the right to culturally sensitive health care for all immigrants. There is a broad consensus among experts about the major principles of good practice that need to be implemented across Europe.

{"answers": "Biochemical analysis of injured cervical intervertebral disks reveals the presence of inflammatory markers such as MCP, fragments of structural matrix proteins such as FAC, and a correlation with pH. Further evaluation of the FAC as a potential diagnostic biomarker or therapeutic target is warranted in the cervical spine.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that the fibronectin-aggrecan complex is present in cervical disk disease."}
{"answers": "Affect-regulated exercise to feel 'good' can be used in a training programme to regulate exercise intensity. This approach led to a 19% increase in time to reach ventilatory threshold, which is indicative of improved fitness.", "prediction_text": "The present study indicates that affect-regulated exercise to feel 'good' can be used to control exercise intensity and may lead to improved physical health. This is the first study to examine the effects of affect-regulated exercise on physical health."}
{"answers": "In Southern Italy, hepatitis G virus infection is widespread among patients with chronic hepatitis, independently of parenteral risk factors. Its frequency in subjects with cryptogenic liver disease parallels that observed in hepatitis C virus chronic liver disease, thus ruling out an aetiologic role of hepatitis G virus. TT virus infection is uncommon in patients with cryptogenic or hepatitis C virus-related liver disease who do not have a history of parenteral exposure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, hepatitis G virus and TT virus are involved in cryptogenic chronic liver disease."}
{"answers": "Our findings suggest that somatic complaints may represent one, but not necessarily the most important, risk factor for the subsequent development of depressive symptoms in women in nonclinical populations. The results also highlight the importance of including social variables in studies on women's depression as well as conducting additional research to further examine predictors of depressive symptoms in men.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that somatic complaints may be a risk factor for the development of depressive symptoms in women."}
{"answers": "Peak inspiratory pressure, PEEP, and ventilation index values could distinguish survivors from nonsurvivors by day 3. This may assist in early application of supportive nonconventional therapies in children with malignancy and ARDS.", "prediction_text": "Early respiratory predictors of mortality in children with hemato-oncology malignancy who developed ARDS are peak inspiratory pressure, positive end-expiratory pressure, and ventilation index values."}
{"answers": "In this small study serum inhibin concentrations higher than those found in the early follicular phase one to two weeks after evacuation of a hydatidiform mole seemed to be specific for persistent trophoblastic disease. Further data are needed to confirm these promising results.", "prediction_text": "Inhibin is a new circulating marker of hydatidiform mole. It is a promising marker for the diagnosis of hydatidiform mole and may be useful in the follow-up of these patients."}
{"answers": "The integration of whole-lesion dynamic data tends to improve specificity. However, no statistical significance backs up this finding.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that the most suspect curve, the curve-type distribution percentage, and combined dynamic data are the most useful parameters for the diagnosis of breast lesions in MRM. The diagnostic accuracy of the most suspect curve was 80.4%, the curve-type distribution percentage was 84.3%, and the combined dynamic data was 84.3%. These values are similar to those reported in previous studies."}
{"answers": "The seemingly exaggerated traditional fear of anaphylaxis seems to discourage surgeons from more widely adopting minimal access techniques for the treatment of hydatid cyst.", "prediction_text": "The results of this survey suggest that fear of anaphylactic shock is a major barrier to the adoption of minimal-access techniques in the treatment of liver hydatid cysts in northern Jordan."}
{"answers": "Grandmultiparous women had increased maternal and neonatal morbidity, and neonatal mortality even after controlling for confounders, suggesting a need for closer observation than regular multiparous patients during labor and delivery.", "prediction_text": "Grandmultiparous women are at significantly higher risk for adverse perinatal outcomes than multiparous women 30 years or older."}
{"answers": "No single data source is likely to provide a complete health profile for an individual.

{"answers": "These data suggest a pattern of diagnostic stability over time for manic and mixed episodes in patients with bipolar disorder. Careful prospective studies of this issue are needed.", "prediction_text": "The manic/mixed episode distinction in patients with bipolar disorder is consistent over time."}
{"answers": "The analyses show that structural characteristics of a practice are not associated with uptake of a new IT facility, but that its use may be influenced by post-graduate education in the relevant clinical condition. For this diabetes system at least, practice nurse use was critical in spreading uptake beyond initial GP enthusiasts and for sustained and rising use in subsequent years.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that the number of diabetes-educated staff in a general practice is associated with increased use of a web-based clinical information system in diabetes care. This suggests that the use of IT innovations in primary care is influenced by the availability of IT-trained staff."}
{"answers": "GAPS, a simple clinical score, is a better predictor of admission than triage nurses, unless the nurse is sure about the outcome, in which case their clinical judgement should be respected.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that GAPS is a more accurate predictor of admission than VAS, and that it is more accurate than the nurses' subjective assessment."}
{"answers": "Our data showed no difference in 25(OH) D levels between normal children and those with CD when adjusted for body mass index.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that vitamin D deficiency is not a feature of pediatric celiac disease."}
{"answers": "Granulomatous myelotoxicity and enteritis developed in a 21 year old female within 3 weeks of initiating sulfasalazine for rheumatoid arthritis. Following a short course of corticosteroids, the patient had resolution of her cholestatic hepatitis, rash, eosinophilia, and gastrointestinal symptoms with no residual manifestations at 7 months follow-up. Although severe reactions to sulfasalazine are rare and unpredictable, practicing physicians should be aware of unusual clinical presentations of toxicity when prescribing sulfasalazine.", "prediction_text": "The patient's clinical course and management are consistent with Crohn's disease. The patient's symptoms and clinical course are also consistent with the clinical features of Crohn's disease. The patient's clinical course and management are consistent with the clinical features of Crohn's disease."}
{"answers": "Healthy lifestyles lead to an increase in the utilization of preventive health services. However, there is not much significantly reducing the number of outpatient visits in people with health behaviors. Specifically, people with regular exercise habits and who take their blood pressure measurement regularly have an increased number of outpatient visits. It is suggested that more available and accessible health consultation services be provided to inculcate in the general public the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle.", "prediction_text": "Yes, healthier lifestyles lead to less utilization of healthcare resources."}
{"answers": "Parental restriction of R-rated movie viewing is associated with both lower adolescent smoking susceptibility and lower smoking rates.", "prediction_text": "The results of this study suggest that parental R-rated movie restriction is associated with lower adolescent smoking susceptibility."}
{"answers": "Having a usual physician can be an effective tool in improving access to care for low-income populations, although it is most effective when combined with insurance coverage. However, the effectiveness of managed care in linking more low-income persons to a medical home is uncertain, and may have unintended consequences for uninsured persons.", "prediction_text": "The study found that managed care penetration is associated with a lower likelihood of having a usual source of care for uninsured persons, as well as a lower likelihood of having a usual physician. The association between managed care and access is less pronounced for privately insured and Medicaid beneficiaries."}
{"answers": "Locally 1.0% ropivacaine administration significantly relieves the pain of pediatric tonsillectomy and, it is a safe and effective method. High concentrations of ropivaciane may produce clinically significant pain relief.

The technique is reproducible and applicable in routine surgery."}
{"answers": "Comparisons of absolute EOA values grouped by the manufacturers' valve sizes are misleading because of specific differences in geometric dimensions. The EOA:patient aortic annulus area ratio provides a new hemodynamic index which may facilitate objective comparisons between different valve types.", "prediction_text": "The present study does not support the recommendation of using the effective orifice area/patient aortic annulus area ratio as a conclusive diagnostic tool for aortic valve replacement."}
{"answers": "Women compared to men often delay seeking treatment for an AMI, which further increases their risks. Our findings suggest specific characteristics that can serve as a profile to those African Americans most likely to delay seeking treatment for AMI.", "prediction_text": "African Americans delay in seeking medical care for AMI more frequently than whites, and the reasons for delay are related to the patient's perception of the severity of their symptoms and their belief that their symptoms are not serious enough to seek medical care."}
{"answers": "A reduced alveolar macrophage phagocytic host response to apoptotic cells or NTHi may contribute to neutrophilic inflammation and NTHi colonization in both PBB and bronchiectasis. Whether this mechanism also contributes to the progression of PBB to bronchiectasis remains unknown.", "prediction_text": "Alveolar macrophage phagocytic dysfunction in children with bronchiectasis or PBB may contribute to the development of bronchiectasis."}
{"answers": "Cervical physical therapy can have a positive effect on subjective tinnitus complaints in patients with a combination of tinnitus and neck complaints. Larger studies, using more responsive outcome measures, are however necessary to prove this effect.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that cervical physical therapy can improve tinnitus complaints in patients with cervicogenic somatic tinnitus."}
{"answers": "Because workers may have an elevated relative aerobic workload for several hours each working day, this relationship may elucidate a mechanism behind the increased risk for cardiovascular disease among workers exposed to high levels of occupational physical activity.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that a high relative aerobic workload is associated with increased ambulatory blood pressure in cleaners."}
{"answers": "Our investigation did not undoubtedly prove that significant changes of fetal biometric parameters occurred in the last three decades. It is possible that secular growth acceleration does not exist in prenatal period but also the observed time period could have been short for this phenomenon to manifest.", "prediction_text": "The present study does not support the hypothesis about the existence of secular growth acceleration during fetal life."}
{"answers": "Consistent with prior studies, we found an inverse relationship between obesity and serum prostate specific antigen. However, the magnitude of the difference was small. Thus, adjusting prostate specific antigen for body mass index does not appear warranted.", "prediction_text": "The present study does not support the recommendation of adjusting prostate specific antigen for body mass index."}
{"answers": "Emergency laparotomy carries a high rate of mortality, especially in those over the age of 70 years, and more needs to be done to improve outcomes, particularly in this group. This could involve increasing acute surgical care manpower, early recognition of patients requiring emergency surgery, development of clear management protocols for such patients or perhaps even considering centralisation of emergency surgical services to specialist centres with multidisciplinary teams involving emergency surgeons and care of the elderly physicians in hospital and related community outreach services for post-discharge care.", "prediction_text": "The mortality rate following emergency laparotomy is higher in the elderly population. This study suggests that the mortality rate is higher in the elderly population and that the mortality rate is higher in those aged 70 years and above. This study also suggests that the mortality rate is higher in the elderly population and that the mortality rate is higher in those aged 70 years and above."}
{"answers": "[corrected] This observation is exceptional in many aspects: very early age of onset of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, no immune deficit, association with a rare congenital neurological syndrome. We discuss the possible link between this entity and the occurrence of tuberculosis.", "prediction_text": "The occurrence of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis in an immuno-competent child with a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome is a possible causative link."}

{"answers": "Trauma patients have a significant complication rate related to anticoagulation therapy, and predicting which patients will develop a complication remains unclear. Prospective studies are needed to determine which treatment regimen, if any, is appropriate to safely anticoagulate this high risk population.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients is safe and that complications are rare. However, the incidence of complications is higher in patients receiving UH than FH."}
{"answers": "A significant difference in dental health between recruits to each Service does exist and is a likely to be a reflection of the sociodemographic background from which they are drawn.", "prediction_text": "The present study has shown that recruits in the Army have a significantly greater prevalence of dental decay and greater treatment resource need than either of the other two Services. This may reflect the oral health of recruits joining the Army."}
{"answers": "In light of the large sample size and prior pilot testing of presented images, results suggest that episodic migraineurs do not differentially attend to headache-related facial stimuli. Given modest evidence of attentional biases among chronic headache samples, these findings suggest potential differences in attentional processing between chronic and episodic headache subforms.", "prediction_text": "Migraineurs do not exhibit attentional bias to headache-related visual stimuli."}
{"answers": "Under the conditions of this study, preclerkship (year 2) CPEs strongly predicted medical students at risk for failing a senior CPE. This finding opens the opportunity for remediation of deficits prior to or during clerkships.", "prediction_text": "The results of this study suggest that students' performance on preclerkship clinical performance examinations can be used to identify those at risk for failing a senior clinical performance examination. This information can be used to help students prepare for the senior CPE and to identify students who may need additional remediation."}
{"answers": "Our results suggest that people do not attach a simple fixed premium to \"safety-related\" interventions but that preferences depend more subtly on context. The use of the results of such public preference surveys to directly inform policy would therefore be premature.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that the public places a greater value on preventing hospital-acquired infections than on genetic disorders, drug errors, and injuries to health care staff. This finding is consistent with the results of previous studies."}
{"answers": "Minimising the radiation dose to one of the parotid glands with the help of IMRT in patients with advanced head and neck cancers can prevent xerostomia in most patients and parotid scintigraphy is a useful method of documenting xerostomia.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that dose reduction to one parotid gland can prevent xerostomia in most of the patients undergoing IMRT with or without chemotherapy."}
{"answers": "It is important to continue FA supplementation over the long term in patients on methotrexate and FA in order to prevent them discontinuing treatment because of mouth ulcers or nausea and vomiting. Our data suggest that FA supplementation is also helpful in preventing neutropenia, with very little loss of efficacy of methotrexate.", "prediction_text": "Patients with rheumatoid arthritis established on methotrexate and folic acid 5 mg daily may need to continue folic acid supplementation long term to maintain the benefits of methotrexate therapy."}
{"answers": "LF and cruroplasty is feasible and has good results in terms of GERD symptoms control and additional weight loss.

{"answers": "In this paper the effect of lunar phases on the time of delivery is shown. This influence seems to be especially relevant in the case of multiparae and plurigravidae. Nevertheless, it is too weak to allow for prediction regarding the days with the highest frequency of deliveries.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that the lunar position may influence the time of delivery, especially in multiparae and plurigravidae."}
{"answers": "Financial incentives for smoking cessation in pregnancy are highly cost-effective, with an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life years of \u00a3482, which is well below recommended decision thresholds.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that financial incentives for smoking cessation during pregnancy are cost-effective. The incremental cost per quitter at 34-38 weeks pregnant is similar to the standard look-up value derived from Stapleton&West's published ICER tables, \u00a31390 per quitter. The life-time model resulted in an incremental cost of \u00a317 and a gain of 0.04 QALYs. The expected value of perfect information was \u00a330 million, so given current uncertainty, additional research is potentially worthwhile."}
{"answers": "This data demonstrates the robust nature of the short stay ward. At these two very different institutions we have shown improved bed efficient and patient care in a cost-effective way. We have also reported on greater parental satisfaction and early return of the child with their family to the community.", "prediction_text": "The short stay or 23-hour ward in a general and academic children's hospital is a useful addition to the emergency service. This is a descriptive comparison of prospectively collected data on all children admitted to the short stay ward at Westmead Hospital during 1994 and the short stay ward at the New Children's Hospital during 1997-98. These hospitals serve an identical demographic area with the latter a tertiary referral center. The following outcome measures were used: length of stay, appropriateness of stay, rate of admission to an in-hospital bed, and rate of unscheduled visits within 72 hours of discharge. Adverse events were reported and patient follow-up was attempted at 48 hours after discharge in all cases"}
{"answers": "Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery is a safe method of treatment in patients with Cushing's disease.

Because of the risk of late relapse, patients require life-long follow-up.", "prediction_text": "The results of transsphenoidal pituitary surgery in patients with Cushing's disease over a period of 18 years, and the factors which will predict the outcome."}
{"answers": "Patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms have a great diversity of functional somatic symptoms. They use more somatic and psychotropic drugs than controls in the years before diagnosis. Moreover, they show high rates of referrals and psychiatric morbidity. The diversity of symptoms of patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms supports the concept that symptoms do not cluster in well defined distinct syndromes. Therefore, patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms should preferably not be classified into medical subspecialty syndromes.", "prediction_text": "The present study supports the hypothesis that chronic functional somatic symptoms are a single syndrome. The syndrome is associated with somatic and psychiatric morbidity, and is a predictor of hospital admissions."}
{"answers": "The vast majority of MDT decisions are implemented. Management alteration was most often due to patient choice or additional information available after the MDT. A minority of management alterations were 'unjustifiable' and the authors recommend that any patient whose treatment is subsequently changed should have MDT rediscussion prior to treatment.", "prediction_text": "The majority of MDT decisions are concordant with the patient's management, but there is a small proportion of discordant decisions. The MDT approach is a gold standard in breast cancer management."}
{"answers": "We found that 1.6% of S. aureus (all MSSA) from bacteraemic patients were PVL-positive. This low incidence suggests that PVL-positive S. aureus are of no particular significance as causative agents of S. aureus bacteraemia.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that PVL-positive S. aureus are more likely to be resistant to penicillin and fusidic acid, and that the majority of PVL-positive S. aureus are susceptible to all antibiotics tested."}
{"answers": "These findings are in accordance with previous experimental work and provide additional support for the assertion that dogs can prime autistic children for therapy.

However, the risk of emerging viral resistance is a concern."}
{"answers": "Mucosal redundancy is a constant associated finding in IHPS. Although the origin of the redundancy and a cause-and-effect relationship are difficult to establish, our findings support the hypothesis that hypergastrinemia may be implicated in the pathogenesis of IHPS, and suggest that mucosal thickening could be implicated as one of the initiating factors in its development.", "prediction_text": "The present study demonstrates that pyloric mucosal redundancy is a constant finding in infants with IHPS, and that it is likely to be a contributing factor in the development of IHPS. The hypothesis that pyloric mucosal redundancy is a factor in the development of IHPS is supported by the present findings."}
{"answers": "Given the available screening technologies, discordant TEOAE and AABR may be inevitable for some categories of hearing loss among apparently healthy newborns whose mothers received prenatal care. The potential limitations of perinatal morbidities as basis of targeted screening for such cases therefore merit further consideration.", "prediction_text": "Yes, discordance in TEOAE and AABR outcomes can be predicted in newborns. The present study suggests that maternal and infant factors associated with discordant outcomes can be identified with multivariable logistic regression analyses adjusting for potential confounding factors."}
{"answers": "GM of CRC and SLM was associated with fewer procedures but did not influence overall survival. SM was associated with a longer delay and increased use of chemotherapy between procedures, suggesting that more rigorous selection of SM patients for surgery may explain the higher disease-free survival after SLM resection.", "prediction_text": "The present study does not support the recommendation of global management for colorectal cancer with synchronous liver metastases."}
{"answers": "epiDWI has the potential to differentiate pleomorphic adenoma and myoepithelial adenomas from all other examined entities. Due to an overlap not only within the group of benign and malignant lesions but also between groups, diagnoses should not be addressed on the basis of ADC values solely. Therefore, further studies combining DWI, morphologic criteria, and probably other MR imaging techniques seem warranted.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that the use of epiDWI in the evaluation of primary parotid gland tumors may be useful in differentiating between different histologic subtypes."}
{"answers": "The survey shows significant dissatisfaction amongst consultant radiologists with the current service, confirms a low number of paediatric radiologists taking on this work, and suggests the potential to increase numbers of radiology child abuse experts by 27% if given improved training and support. Appropriate service and education strategies should be implemented.", "prediction_text": "The majority of radiologists were satisfied with the training and support they received in suspected child abuse. However, there was a significant variation in the level of satisfaction depending on the type of radiological service provided."}

{"answers": "Our data have revealed a number of differences. Compared to the clinic sample, the Web-based sample had worse psychological symptom burden, younger average age, higher prevalence of employment, and a lower proportion on ART. For future research, we recommend that Web-based data collection should include the demographic variables that we note differed between samples. In addition, we recognize that each recruitment method may bring inherent sampling bias, with clinic populations differing by geographical location and reflecting those accessing regular medical care, and Web-based sampling recruiting those with greater Internet access and identifying survey materials through specific searches and contact with specific websites.", "prediction_text": "The recruitment setting (Web-based vs clinic) did not significantly affect the physical or psychological symptom burden of gay men living with HIV."}
{"answers": "The majority of acetabular components in this cohort were stable despite the small contact surface achieved between the component and pelvic bone. Three of 10 migrated in excess of the limits that predict later loosening in primary THA but it remains to be seen whether these limits apply to this selected group of frail osteoporotic patients. We continue to use this technique routinely to treat patients with the same indications, but since the analysis of these data we have added screw fixation of the acetabular component to the ischial tuberosity and the superior pubic ramus.", "prediction_text": "Yes, cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups provides initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures."}
{"answers": "Despite high perioperative mortality, results document a sustainable recovery of the survivors offering the prospect of a highly independent and satisfying life.

This is the first study to investigate this association in a population-based cohort of singletons without congenital malformations."}
{"answers": "Although feasible, double reading of barium enemas does not improve sensitivity for detection of polyps and produces a higher false-positive rate.", "prediction_text": "Double reading of barium enemas is necessary to increase the sensitivity and specificity of detecting polyps and carcinomas."}
{"answers": "The VMPA can provide direct access and favorable visibility to the TMJ region and yield good esthetic and functional results. The VMPA can be considered the approach of choice for common TMJ surgeries.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that the vascular-guided multilayer preauricular approach to the TMJ can improve access and decrease complications."}
{"answers": "The metastasis rate of station 9 lymph nodes was significantly lower than other mediastinal stations in lung cancer patients. The metastasis status of station 9 had no significant influence on tumor staging or prognosis. Routine dissection of station 9 lymph nodes may not be necessary, especially in patients with a low T stage, upper or middle lobe tumors, or without intrapulmonary lymph node metastasis.", "prediction_text": "Routine dissection of station 9 lymph nodes is not necessary for primary lung cancer surgery. The metastasis rate of station 9 is significantly lower than other mediastinal lymph node stations, and the metastasis of station 9 nodes is not likely to occur even in GGO patients."}
{"answers": "During the time period considered, the FDA AED-related suicidality warning does not appear to have significantly affected prescription claims of AED medications for the study population.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not detect any significant change in prescription claims of antiepileptic drugs following the FDA suicidality warning."}
{"answers": "In our population of stroke survivors, self-reports of motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions differed from government records. In future studies, the use of both government and self-reported data would ensure a more accurate picture of driving safety post-stroke.", "prediction_text": "The kappa coefficient for the correlation between MTO records and self-reports was 0.52 for collisions and 0.47 for convictions (both in the moderate range of agreement)."}
{"answers": "The realized communication skills courses resulted in relevant changes in communication behaviour and self-confidence of participants. Communication with terminally ill patients can be taught.", "prediction_text": "Yes, communication with terminally ill patients can be taught. This study has shown that a 2-day course model can be used to improve communication skills of physicians."}
{"answers": "For conditions with a well-developed quality of care evidence base, such as hypertension and diabetes, a single structured implicit review to assess the quality of care over a period of time is moderately reliable. This method could be a reasonable complement or alternative to explicit indicator approaches for assessing and comparing quality of care. Structured implicit review, like explicit quality measures, must be used more cautiously for illnesses for which the evidence base is less well developed, such as COPD and acute, short-course illnesses.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that peer review can be a useful tool in assessing the quality of care for chronic disease and that the reliability of the ratings can be improved by using a structured instrument."}
{"answers": "The high rate of unsuccessful IUD insertions reported here, particularly for nulliparous women, suggests that the true insertion failure rate of providers who are not employing additional tools for difficult insertions may be much higher than reported in clinical trials. Further investigation is necessary to determine if this is a common problem and, if so, to assess if the use of adjuvant measures will reduce the number of unsuccessful IUD insertions.", "prediction_text": "The rate of failed IUD insertions in community practice is higher than previously reported. The use of cervical anesthesia and ultrasound guidance may improve the success rate of IUD insertions."}
{"answers": "Even in capped health care systems, virtual planning and guided surgery including prebent or milled plates are financially viable.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that virtual planning and guided surgery with or without prebent or milled plates are becoming more and more common for mandibular reconstruction with fibular free flaps. Although this excellent surgical option is being used more widely, the question of the additional cost of planning and cutting-guide production has to be discussed. In capped payment systems, such additional costs have to be offset by other savings if there are no special provisions for extra funding. Our study was designed to determine whether using virtual planning and guided surgery resulted in time saved during surgery and whether this time gain resulted in self-funding of such planning through the time saved. All consecutive cases of FFF surgery were evaluated during a 2-year period. Institutional data were used to"}
{"answers": "Bipolarity does not independently influence risk of suicidal behavior or alter the influence of well-established suicide risk factors within affective disorders. Suicide risk assessment strategies may continue to appraise these common risk factors without regard to mood polarity.", "prediction_text": "The present study does not support the hypothesis that suicide risk differs by polarity of affective disorder."}
{"answers": "The administration of polyvalent Crotalidae antivenin is safe. Acute hypersensitivity, when it occurs, consists solely in most cases of urticaria. Serious side effects are uncommon.", "prediction_text": "The aggressive use of polyvalent antivenin for rattlesnake bites does not result in serious acute side effects."}
{"answers": "Although endomyocardial fibrosis patients have improved clinical symptoms after surgery, the global left ventricular ejection fraction and regional wall motion in these patients do not change. This finding suggests that other explanations, such as improvements in diastolic function, may be operational.", "prediction_text": "Fibrous tissue resection in endomyocardial fibrosis patients does not improve left ventricular global systolic function. However, it does improve left ventricular regional wall motion in the apical and inferoapical regions."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrates that laser pretreatment significantly increases absorption of topical lidocaine so that it is detectable in the blood and that manipulating laser settings can affect drug absorption. Future work will look at translating this effect into clinical benefit.", "prediction_text": "The present study demonstrates that laser treatment enhances transdermal delivery of lidocaine in an in vivo animal model."}
{"answers": "Vaccines were exposed to temperatures that may reduce their potency. Safe storage of vaccines in the clinics cannot be ensured without adhering to the recommended guidelines. Provision of adequate equipment and training for staff in maintaining the \"cold chain\" and the use and care of equipment are important components of a successful immunisation programme.", "prediction_text": "The present study has shown that the majority of general practices and child health clinics do not adhere to Department of Health guidelines for vaccine storage. The vaccines are exposed to temperatures up to 16 degrees C in 6 of the 8 practices selected for monitoring. The vaccines are stored in the cold chain in 2 of the 8 practices selected for monitoring."}
{"answers": "p53 alteration detected by IHC or SSCP analysis is not a clinically useful predictor of local response to pre-operative adjuvant therapy in advanced rectal carcinoma.", "prediction_text": "The present study does not support the recommendation of p53 alterations as a conclusive diagnostic tool for tumour response to pre-operative chemo-radiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer."}
{"answers": "The results of this study cast doubt on the suggested advantage of HBO in reducing patient mortality and morbidity when used as adjuvant therapy for NF.", "prediction_text": "The present study does not support the recommendation of hyperbaric oxygenation therapy for necrotizing fasciitis."}
{"answers": "High doses of ZNS are effective and safe in pharmacoresistant epileptic patients.

{"answers": "In conclusion, high Ki-67 expression was associated with poor survival in patients with UTUC, as well as a high risk of disease progression, although these findings need to be interpreted with caution. Large-scale, adequately designed, prospective trials are needed to further confirm the value of Ki-67 in prognosis of UTUC patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, overexpression of Ki-67 is a significant prognostic marker for UTUC patients."}
{"answers": "After comparing MR with arthroscopic findings and reviewing the available literature, we conclude that arthroscopy permits the direct visualization of even fine articular surface changes but does not depict the subchondral bone, the most frequent site of injury detected with MRI. MRI was a very useful tool in the detection and characterization of the different types of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries and showed a statistically significant correlation between site and distribution of bone and cartilage injuries and between internal damage and trauma mechanisms. Therefore, we believe that MRI can help avoid diagnostic arthroscopy in the patients with a history of post-traumatic pain, acute articular blocks and negative radiographic findings.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that MRI may be a better diagnostic tool than arthroscopy for occult posttraumatic knee injuries."}
{"answers": "The prevalence of cognitive impairment in MND in this population based study of an unselected cohort was higher than has been previously reported. Language deficits, especially anomia, may be relatively frequent in the MND population. Aphasia in MND may be masked by dysarthria and missed if not specifically examined.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that cognitive deficits are common in motor neuron disease and that the majority of patients with motor neuron disease are not demented. The findings also suggest that the presence of aphasia is associated with motor neuron disease."}
{"answers": "Postoperative numbness occurs in most patients receiving nasal microfat injections. Partial to complete recovery of nasal tip sensation can be expected to occur over a 3-month period.", "prediction_text": "The present study showed that the sensation in the nasal tip returned to normal after microfat injections. The results also suggest that the procedure is safe and effective."}
{"answers": "Conveyance of emotions or movements through music may be decoded differently by persons with different types of communication disorders. Because music is the primary therapeutic tool in music therapy sessions, clinicians should consider these differential abilities when selecting music for clinical interventions focusing on emotions or movement.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that children with hearing loss and autism spectrum disorder may have difficulty recognizing musical emotions and movements. This may have implications for music therapy interventions."}
{"answers": "For some patients, using colour to describe their pain experience may be a useful tool to improve doctor-patient communication.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that patients can use colour to describe osteoarthritis pain, but there are issues around interpretability and standardization of colour."}
{"answers": "It appears safe to administer intensive chemotherapy regimens at standard doses to rural patients without increased morbidity or mortality. Support for general practitioners through phone or videoconferencing may reduce the safety concerns.", "prediction_text": "The present study does not support the recommendation of intensive chemotherapy for rural cancer patients."}
{"answers": "Although outcomes for EPSCC remains poor, both surgery and radiation is shown to significantly improve median, 5- and 10-year survival rates. EPSCC patients who are potential candidates for surgical resection or radiation therapy may benefit from these treatments.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that surgery and radiation therapy are independent predictors of survival for patients with extrapulmonary small cell cancers."}
{"answers": "DGE after PPPD seems to be of minor clinical importance following uncomplicated surgery. When taking the results into consideration, it can be said that, despite the lack of a control group, antecolic duodenojejunostomy might be the key to a low incidence of DGE after PPPD. In our experience, DGE is linked to the occurrence of other postoperative complications rather than to pylorus preservation.", "prediction_text": "Delayed gastric emptying following pancreaticoduodenectomy is related to pylorus preservation."}
{"answers": "In women with POP, the symptom of pelvic pain is associated with the presence of defecatory symptoms.", "prediction_text": "Pelvic pain is significantly associated with defecatory symptoms in women with pelvic organ prolapse."}
{"answers": "The results confirm that c-kit is vastly expressed in uveal melanoma, suggest that the c-kit molecular pathway may be important in uveal melanoma growth, and point to its use as a target for therapy with STI571.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that c-kit is a potential therapeutic target for uveal melanoma. The expression of c-kit in uveal melanoma is associated with poor prognosis and the presence of c-kit ligand in uveal melanoma cell lines suggests autocrine stimulation. The inhibitory effects of STI571 on c-kit phosphorylation and cell proliferation suggest that c-kit may be a potential therapeutic target for uveal melanoma."}
{"answers": "Results suggest that telmisartan may reduce type-I diabetes mellitus-induced hepatic injury by suppressing activated hepatic stellate cells through concomitant TGF-beta1 down-regulation.", "prediction_text": "The present study showed that telmisartan prevented hepatic fibrosis in rats with alloxan-induced diabetes."}
{"answers": "The great majority of U.S. renal transplant centers will not transplant kidneys to HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease, even if their infection is asymptomatic. However, advances in the management of HIV infection and a review of relevant ethical issues suggest that this approach should be reconsidered.", "prediction_text": "The current policy of excluding HIV-infected patients from transplantation should be reevaluated. The majority of transplant centers would not transplant a kidney from an HIV-infected patient who is otherwise a good candidate for transplantation."}
{"answers": "The overall yield of SL for HCC was 7 %, and the accuracy was 27 %. When accurate imaging methods are available and additional percutaneous liver biopsy is implemented as a standard procedure in the preoperative workup of patients with HCC, the benefit of SL will become even less.", "prediction_text": "SL for HCC is useful in detecting unresectable tumors and in assessing the extent of disease. It may also be useful in determining the extent of cirrhosis."}
{"answers": "Expert breast pathology assessments continue to be necessary in the management of DCIS.", "prediction_text": "Expert breast pathology assessment is necessary for the management of DCIS as it can lead to a change in the assessment of local recurrence risk and treatment recommendation."}
{"answers": "Vaginal pH should be measured by bringing the pH strip in direct contact with fresh vaginal fluid without first adding saline.", "prediction_text": "The accuracy of vaginal pH measurement on wet mount microscopy slides is dependent on the sampling device used and on the diagnosis of the vaginal infections. The use of a cotton swab, cytobrush or wooden spatula is recommended to avoid false positive readings."}
{"answers": "This study presents a different clinical picture of oral mucoceles/ranulas, as observed in HIV-positive patients. Additionally, it suggests a possible clinical link between the two pathologies. The authors strongly support the suggestion that oral mucocele/ranula is an HIV-related salivary gland disease.", "prediction_text": "Oral mucoceles/ranulas are more common in HIV-positive patients, especially those with a history of oral lesions. The presence of a mucocele/ranula is a sign of HIV infection."}
{"answers": "There are no data to support the widespread practice of using central venous pressure to guide fluid therapy. This approach to fluid resuscitation should be abandoned.", "prediction_text": "Despite a previous meta-analysis that concluded that central venous pressure should not be used to make clinical decisions regarding fluid management, central venous pressure continues to be recommended for this purpose."}
{"answers": "Increased D-dimer levels should not be considered as a diagnostic parameter in diagnosis of acute appendicitis.", "prediction_text": "The present study does not support the recommendation of D-dimer as a conclusive diagnostic tool for acute appendicitis."}
{"answers": "Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mitochondria play a role in remodelling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death. The present study elucidates the role of mitochondria during PCD in A. madagascariensis."}
{"answers": "Our study emphasised the discomfort of transurethral urinary catheters, especially in male patients, and the high incidence of urinary tract infections in both sexes. Consideration should be given to the utilisation of alternative methods of bladder drainage, such as suprapubic catheterisation, which can be performed with ease during laparotomy.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that transurethral catheterisation is associated with a higher risk of urinary tract infection than other methods of bladder drainage."}

{"answers": "European individuals with type 1 diabetes consume a high atherogenic diet as few patients met recommendations for dietary fibre and saturated fat. This study showed minor changes in dietary nutrients and energy intakes over a period of 7 years. Nutrition education needs particular focus on strategies to increase dietary fibre and reduce saturated fat to exploit their potential benefit.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that European individuals with type 1 diabetes consume a diet that is high in fat and low in fibre."}
{"answers": "The gaps in patella eversion demonstrated smaller gaps both in knee extension and flexion position compared to the gaps of patella reduction position. The amount of decreased gaps was more definite in knee flexion position. Therefore, the intraoperative patellar positioning has influence on the measurement of the joint gap. Keeping the patella in reduced position is important during gap balancing.", "prediction_text": "The patella position does influence the ligament balancing in total knee arthroplasty. The patella subluxation and evertion positions are associated with larger gaps in the patella position compared to the patella reduction position."}
{"answers": "We have thus provided compelling evidence that there is a mossy fiber GABAergic signal. The physiologic role of this mossy fiber GABAergic signal is uncertain, but may be of developmental importance. Other evidence suggests that this GABAergic signal is transiently upregulated after seizures. This could have an inhibitory or disinhibitory effect, and further work is needed to elucidate its actual role.", "prediction_text": "Mossy fibers release GABA, which is a key inhibitory neurotransmitter in the dentate gyrus granule cells. This release is likely to be involved in the generation of seizures in epilepsy."}
{"answers": "Men and women in this community sample reported similar patterns of depressive symptoms. No evidence that the presentation of depressive symptoms differs by gender was found.", "prediction_text": "The present study does not support the hypothesis that higher rates of depression in women are accounted for by differential symptom reporting."}

Further studies on care before diagnosis are important in drawing up meaningful quality indicators.", "prediction_text": "Delayed TPT did not impact overall survival in breast cancer patients."}
{"answers": "Our findings reveal a significant decrease in ADMA levels of ex-ELBW subjects compared to C, underlining a probable correlation with preterm birth and low birth weight. Taken together, these results may underlie the onset of early circulatory dysfunction predictive of increased cardiovascular risk.", "prediction_text": "ADMA levels in ex-ELBW subjects are significantly correlated with both gestational age and birth weight, and may be a potential marker for endothelial dysfunction."}
{"answers": "ECL assays improved the ability to predict time to diabetes in these autoantibody-positive relatives at risk for developing diabetes. These findings might be helpful in the design and eligibility criteria for prevention trials in the future.", "prediction_text": "Yes, ECL assays can improve prediction of time to type 1 diabetes in TrialNet autoantibody-positive subjects."}
{"answers": "These findings indicate that a relationship between multiple sclerosis and streptococcal infections may exist, but to acquire a better understanding of the role of group A streptococci in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, more studies with animal models are necessary.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that there may be a relationship between streptococcal infection and MS. The results of this study may be useful in the development of new therapeutic strategies for MS."}
{"answers": "Aplastic anemia is associated with a variety of autoimmune syndromes. The sequence of events in our patient suggests that the hepatic failure, AFOP, and the VSAA may all have been part of an autoimmune syndrome. AFOP could be the result of immune dysregulation in this pediatric case with favorable outcome after immunosuppressive therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.", "prediction_text": "The present case report suggests that AFOP may be a manifestation of immune dysregulation. The patient's response to immunosuppressive therapy was dramatic, and the disease was fatal."}
{"answers": "Rescue AC may apply to only 18% of cases, and we identified subsets of more likely candidates.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that the potential opportunity for rescue of continuing pregnancy after antenatal corticosteroid administration is more likely in women who received AC for premature preterm rupture of membranes or twins. The latter group had a higher likelihood of delivery within 1 week of AC."}
{"answers": "The results show that fatigue in patients with pSS and sSS is not due to the coexistence of FM in most cases. A lower incidence in the United Kingdom of FM in patients with pSS was found than has been previously reported.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that fatigue is more common in patients with primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome who complain of fatigue than in lupus patients. The association and prevalence of fatigue and FM was recorded in a group of patients with pSS and a control group of lupus patients, a subset of whom had secondary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (sSS). 74 patients with pSS and 216 patients with lupus were assessed with a questionnaire to identify the presence of fatigue and generalised pain. From the lupus group, in a subset of 117 lupus patients (from the Bloomsbury unit) those with sSS were identified. All patients were studied for the presence of FM. 50 of 74 patients"}

{"answers": ": Data from both association and expression studies suggested that variants at HINT1 may be associated with schizophrenia and the associations may be sex-specific. However, the markers showing associations were in high LD to the SPEC2/PDZ-GEF2/ACSL6 locus reported previously in the same samples. This made it difficult to separate the association signals amongst these genes. Other independent studies may be necessary to distinguish these candidate genes.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that the HINT1 gene may be a candidate for schizophrenia."}
{"answers": "Out of the four sacral sparing criteria, the acute phase anal sensory score measurements do not contribute significantly to the prognosis of independent ambulation. The combination of the acute phase voluntary anal contraction and the S4-5 LT and PP scores, predicts significantly better chronic phase-independent ambulation outcomes than the currently used distinction between complete and incomplete SCI.", "prediction_text": "Yes, determination between complete and incomplete traumatic spinal cord injury is clinically relevant."}
{"answers": "These findings suggest that schizophrenia is associated with progressive structural brain abnormalities, affecting both gray and white matter. We found no evidence to suggest progressive medial temporal lobe involvement but did find evidence that this may be partly explained by heterogeneity between studies in patient age and illness duration. The causes and clinical correlates of these progressive brain changes should now be the focus of investigation.", "prediction_text": "The present study supports the hypothesis that schizophrenia is associated with progressive brain changes over time."}

{"answers": "This is the first known report of concurrent plasma and ISF concentrations of a meropenem antibiotic during CVVHDF. We observed that the ISF concentrations of meropenem were significantly lower than the plasma concentrations, although the present dose was appropriate for infections caused by intermediately susceptible pathogens (MIC\u22644 mg/L).", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that the ISF concentrations of meropenem are similar to plasma concentrations in critically ill patients receiving CVVHDF."}
{"answers": "Despite advances in early diagnosis and surgical technique, 5-year survival of stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma remains low as compared to survival of other solid organ neoplasm. Tumour size<or=3cm, adenocarcinoma histologic type and negative bronchial resection margins were associated with a more favourable outcome in our patient population. More effective multimodality treatments are needed to increase survival rates.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that stage I non-small cell lung cancer is not a true early stage. The 5-year survival rate is 63%, which is similar to the 5-year survival rate of stage II and III disease."}

{"answers": "Although components of the CSM (cognitive and emotional representations, coping strategies) were associated with fears of recurrence, optimism was found to be the strongest predictor of fear, independent of anxiety and level of fear reported prior to treatment.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that pre-treatment fears of recurrence are predictive of long-term fears of recurrence in HNC survivors."}
{"answers": "Older adults enrolled in PICT with more symptoms may sacrifice QOL for experimental treatment.", "prediction_text": "Symptoms do matter when considering patients for phase I clinical trials. The present study suggests that older adults with more symptoms may have a poorer prognosis."}
{"answers": "Effective CPAP treatment in IPF patients with OSA results in a significant improvement in daily living activities based on the FOSQ, namely an OSA-specific follow-up instrument. Improvement was also noted in other questionnaires assessing quality of life, though not to a statistically significant degree, probably because of the multifactorial influences of IPF on physical and mental health. The probability of poor CPAP compliance was high and could only be eliminated with intense follow-up by the CPAP clinic staff.", "prediction_text": "The present study shows that CPAP therapy in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and obstructive sleep apnea can improve sleep and overall life quality parameters."}
{"answers": "Income support policy may be a significant new lever for improving population health, especially that of lower-income persons. Even though the findings are robust, further analyses are needed to confirm their reliability. Future research should examine a variety of different income support policies, as well as whether a broader range of social and economic policies affect health.", "prediction_text": "The Supplemental Security Income program does not reduce disability in the elderly."}
{"answers": "None of the clinical identifiers for early-stage adhesive capsulitis previously proposed by expert consensus have been validated in this study. Clinicians should be aware that commonly used clinical identifiers may not be applicable to this stage.", "prediction_text": "The lack of a recognized reference standard for diagnosing early-stage adhesive capsulitis remains problematic in all related research. The present study does not support the recommendation of ultrasound as a conclusive diagnostic tool for internal derangements of the temporomandibular joint."}

{"answers": "ACS is common in patients with SCD who present with fever and was grossly underestimated by evaluating physicians. History and physical examination appear to be of little value in defining which febrile patients require CXR. In view of the mortality and morbidity associated with ACS, empiric CXR should be considered when evaluating a febrile patient with SCD.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that the use of CXR in febrile patients with SCD is of limited value in detecting ACS. The sensitivity of the physician's clinical impression for ACS is poor, and the diagnostic accuracy of the questionnaire is not improved with increasing levels of pediatric training."}
{"answers": "We conclude that the quality of rectal cancer excision, as defined by mesorectal grades, achieved by supervised colorectal trainees is comparable with that achieved by consultants.", "prediction_text": "The quality of TME surgery is comparable between supervised colorectal trainees and consultants."}
{"answers": "Dutch primary schools could play a more important role in fostering healthy eating habits among children. The school food policy could be improved by clearly formulating food rules, simplifying supervision of the food rules, and defining how to enforce the food rules. In addition, the school food policy will only influence children's dietary behaviour if both the school and the parents support the policy.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that the school food policy at Dutch primary schools is generally perceived as positive by both principals and teachers. However, the majority of the schools do not have a clear food policy and/or implementation plan. The school food policy is perceived as a tool to improve the health of children, but the majority of the schools do not have a clear food policy and/or implementation plan."}
{"answers": "Speed discrimination, per se, is not impaired in schizophrenia patients. The observed abnormality appears to be a consequence of impairment in generating or integrating the feedback information from eye movements. This study introduces a novel approach to motion perception studies and highlights the importance of concurrently measuring eye movements to understand interactions between these two systems; the results argue for a conceptual revision regarding motion perception abnormality in schizophrenia.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that eye-tracking abnormalities in schizophrenia patients may be a consequence of their motion perception deficit."}
{"answers": "(1) There is little overlap between regions of CFAEs during AF and regions of SRF measured in the time domain or the frequency domain, (2) the majority of SRF appears to occur in regions with wave-front collision, (3) the distribution of SRF is similar in patients with AF and normal controls, suggesting that this may not have an important role in AF maintenance and may not be a suitable ablation target.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that there is a significant overlap in the distribution of SRF and CFAE regions in patients with AF. This suggests that SRF may be a useful substrate modification method for AF ablation."}
{"answers": "Continence function remained undisturbed after anastomotic leakage due to rectal resection", "prediction_text": "Anastomotic leakage is a significant complication after rectal resection for cancer. It can affect functional outcome and may require additional treatment. The present study suggests that anastomotic leakage does not significantly affect the continence score or rectal compliance. However, the maximum tolerable volume is slightly but not significantly worse after leakage."}
{"answers": "No evidence was found for OPLL to have any effect on the initial neurologic status or recovery in motor function after traumatic cervical cord injury, suggesting that the neurologic outcome is not significantly dependent on canal space.", "prediction_text": "The present study does not support the recommendation of ultrasound as a conclusive diagnostic tool for internal derangements of the temporomandibular joint."}

{"answers": "The homogeneity we found in the deprivation-mortality relationship across the regions of Scotland and the absence of a contextualized effect of region highlights the importance of taking a broader strategic policy that can combat the toxic impacts of socio-economic deprivation on health. Focusing on a few specific places (e.g. 15% of the poorest areas) to concentrate resources might be a good start but the impact of socio-economic deprivation on mortality is not restricted to a few places. A comprehensive strategy that can be sustained over time might be needed to interrupt the linkages between poverty and mortality.", "prediction_text": "The results of this study suggest that the deprivation-mortality relationship is stable over time and that the spatial heterogeneity in the relationship is not significant. The rejection of the hypothesis of spatial heterogeneity in the relationship between socio-economic deprivation and mortality is consistent with previous research on the stability of the deprivation-mortality relationship over time."}
{"answers": "This study adds to the growing body of literature documenting the importance of the individual therapist as an important factor in the change process.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that the effectiveness of EBTs may be influenced by the therapist's perceived effectiveness and the therapist's ability to develop a strong therapeutic alliance with the patient.

{"answers": "Findings suggest that analgesic management of daily pain is better for nursing home residents enrolled in hospice than for those not enrolled in hospice.The prescribing practices portrayed by this study reveal that many dying nursing home residents in daily pain are receiving no analgesic treatment or are receiving analgesic treatment inconsistent with AMDA and other pain management guidelines. Improving the analgesic management of pain in nursing homes is essential if high-quality end-of-life care in nursing homes is to be achieved.", "prediction_text": "Hospice care in nursing homes improves the management of pain at the end of life."}
{"answers": "The continuity-of-care experiences of vascular trainees are suboptimal. This is especially true for postoperative clinic assessment. Same-day admission surgery accounted for most of the cases and was associated with the poorest continuity of care. To provide complete surgical training in an era of changing therapeutic modalities and same-day admission surgery, vascular programs must be creative in structuring training to include adequate ambulatory experience.", "prediction_text": "The current study suggests that trainees are learning complete surgical care, but there is still room for improvement."}
{"answers": "Simple detorsion was not accompanied by an increase in morbidity, and all patients studied had functioning ovarian tissue on follow-up despite the surgeon's assessment of the degree of ovarian ischemia. Detorsion is the procedure of choice for most cases of ovarian torsion in children.", "prediction_text": "Oophorectomy is not necessary in most pediatric cases of ovarian torsion. The present study suggests that detorsion alone is a viable treatment option."}
{"answers": "Half-dose MR angiography using diluted contrast medium injected at a rate of 1 mL/second depicted the abdominal aorta and its branches as clearly as using a full single dose.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that half-dose contrast-enhanced MR angiography is sufficient for the abdominal aorta and pelvis.

However, further improvements are needed to better reflect the biology of renal cell carcinoma."}
{"answers": "The Young-Burgess system is useful for predicting transfusion requirements. For the system to predict mortality or nonorthopaedic injuries, fractures must be divided into stable (APC1, LC1) and unstable (APC2, APC3, LC2, LC3, VS, combined mechanism of injury) types. LC1 injuries are very common and not always benign (overall mortality rate, 8.2%).", "prediction_text": "The Young-Burgess classification system is not as useful in predicting mortality, transfusion requirements, and nonorthopaedic injuries as it once was. The classification system is no longer as useful as it once was in predicting mortality, transfusion requirements, and nonorthopaedic injuries."}
{"answers": "Parity is not directly linked to insulin sensitivity deterioration, to CP/FPG increase during pregnancy, or to GDM appearance, although it is linked through the mediation of progressive ageing and weight gain either before or during pregnancy, when there is a sufficiently long time interval between pregnancies.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that parity is related to decreased insulin sensitivity during pregnancy. This relationship is independent of age, pregestational weight, and weight gain."}

{"answers": "Although the SLBM is quite repeatable, it underestimates mesopic pupil size and shows a too wide range of agreement with CIP. SLBM shows low sensitivity in detecting pupils larger than 6\u00a0mm, which may be misleading when planning anterior segment surgery. Previous grading-consensus training strategies may increase interrater reproducibility, and compensation for the systematic underestimation could improve accuracy of the SLBM.", "prediction_text": "The SLBM method is a reliable and simple method for measuring pupil size and can be used as a screening tool for detecting pupils larger than 6.0\u00a0mm."}
{"answers": "Although there are different patterns of atrophy across the different FTLD-TDP types, it appears that genetic and pathologic factors may also affect the patterns of atrophy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, TDP-43 type is associated with distinct patterns of brain atrophy on MRI in subjects with pathologically confirmed frontotemporal lobar degeneration."}
{"answers": "A set of educational interventions designed for cancer patients significantly improved their satisfaction with information on clinical research, but did not improve clinical trial enrollment of these participants as of 1 year after the study.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that targeted educational interventions can improve patient satisfaction with information regarding clinical trials and may increase accrual to clinical trials, but there is no evidence that increased patient awareness alone is sufficient to improve accrual to clinical trials."}
{"answers": "There was little evidence that people at high risk of falls received systematic falls risk assessment during rehabilitation. When a risk was identified, generally a strategy was implemented. However, failure to assess some risk factors might have limited fall prevention strategies offered. Failure to adequately address risks during hospitalization could contribute to falls post-discharge. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2016; 16: 570-576.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that the majority of patients at high risk of falls during rehabilitation are not identified and fall prevention strategies are not implemented."}
{"answers": "Although most Medicare beneficiaries who received a new CIED between 2005 and 2009 did not have an initial in-person CIED follow-up visit within 2 to 12 weeks after device implantation, the rate of initial follow-up improved appreciably over time. This CIED follow-up visit was significantly more common in white patients than in patients of other races.", "prediction_text": "The rate of follow-up within 0 to 16 weeks has improved from 2005 to 2009, but the rate of follow-up within 2 to 12 weeks has not changed significantly. The overall rate of follow-up within 1 year has improved significantly."}
{"answers": "According to our study, there is a great variability when different brands and models of scanners are compared directly.

{"answers": "Results of this survey highlight the wide variety of practice patterns in the US for handling surgical margins in breast-conservation treatment. This issue remains controversial, with no prevailing standard of care. Consequently, additional study is needed in the modern era of multimodality treatment to examine the minimal amount of surgical treatment necessary, in conjunction with chemotherapy and radiation, to attain adequate local control rates in breast-conservation treatment.", "prediction_text": "The results of this survey indicate that there is a wide variation in the clinical practices of breast surgeons in the treatment of breast cancer. The most common surgical practice for attaining negative margins is to examine the margins grossly with a pathologist and to use frozen sections or imprint cytology. The decision to reexcise specific margins varies greatly. Most surgeons would accept any negative margin, but 15% would accept a 1-mm negative margin, 28% would accept a 2-mm negative margin, 50% would accept a 5-mm negative margin, and 3% would accept a 10-mm negative margin."}

{"answers": "Our findings suggest that, in HT+ postmenopausal women, the rs2813544 polymorphism may influence LDL-C levels and, as previously described, ESR2 rs1256049 is associated with T-chol and LDL-C. No previous study has investigated the association of this SNP set with lipoprotein levels in women while taking into account the hormonal status of the patients.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that polymorphisms in the oestrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) and oestrogen receptor 2 (ESR2) genes are associated with lipid levels in response to hormone therapy."}
{"answers": "The prevalence of PAD is high in nursing home residents. AAI is not predictive for IHD mortality in this population. In very frail elderly traditional risk factors and PAD are less important predictors of death compared to poor functional status, nutritional factors and previous cardiovascular disease.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that the presence of PAD is not associated with cardiovascular mortality in older patients living in nursing homes. However, the presence of low haemoglobin values, previous cerebrovascular disease, polypharmacy and poor mobility conditions are independently associated with cardiovascular mortality."}
{"answers": "The data demonstrate that vaccination has a relatively weak and short-lasting effect in old age. The results of the study should stimulate discussions about strategies how vaccinations can be made more effective in old age. Improved campaigns, shortened vaccination intervals as well as the design of novel vaccines tailored to fulfill the specific demands of the aging immune system are imaginable.", "prediction_text": "The present study demonstrates that elderly persons are not adequately protected by vaccination against infectious diseases. This is especially true for the elderly who are frail and have a short duration of protective humoral immunity."}
{"answers": "The introduction of a discharge coordinator improved the quality of discharge planning, but at additional cost.", "prediction_text": "The introduction of a discharge coordinator resulted in improved discharge planning and a reduction in problems experienced by patients after discharge, but there was no evidence that the discharge coordinator resulted in a more timely or effective provision of community services after discharge or that the appropriateness or efficiency of bed use was improved."}
{"answers": "Local anesthesia is not required to lower a patient's pain intensity when applying intra-articular contrast media for MR arthrography of the shoulder.

{"answers": "Overall, in a US Air Force population, OSA does not predict a decrease in aerobic fitness as measured by cycle ergometry. However, patients with an apnea-hypopnea index of greater than 20 have a statistically significant decrease in aerobic fitness compared to the normal population. This study demonstrates the effects of OSA on aerobic fitness. Further correlation of fitness testing results with OSA severity and treatment is needed.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that patients with OSA have an objective change in VO2max compared to a normal population. This may be due to the presence of a decreased aerobic fitness in these patients."}
{"answers": "Pictorial HWLs with didactic textual forms seem to work better than those with testimonial narratives. Future research should determine which pictorial HWL content has the greatest real-world impact among consumers from disadvantaged groups, including assessment of how HWL content should change to maintain its impact as tobacco control environments strengthen and consumer awareness of smoking-related risks increases.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that pictorial HWLs with didactic textual forms are more effective than those with testimonial forms. Educational attainment may moderate the effects of these HWLs. The use of diseased organs may be more effective than the use of human suffering in addressing smoking-related health disparities."}

{"answers": "Expression of ER is a constitutional feature of the connective tissue and smooth muscle cells of the anal continence organ. Estrogen receptors and PR are not detectable in the striated muscle fibers of the external anal sphincter in either sex. The presence of ER in the stroma and smooth muscles of the anal canal suggests that these tissues are targets for estrogen. This constitutes a theoretical basis for the beneficial effects of estrogen and progestin replacement on anal continence in postmenopausal women.", "prediction_text": "The present study demonstrates that ER and PR are present in the anal canal and that ER is the predominant receptor in the smooth muscle cells of the internal sphincter. These findings may have implications for the treatment of anal incontinence in women."}

However, renal function is better in the group of young donors.", "prediction_text": "The present study does not support the recommendation of kidney transplantation from elderly donors to young recipients."}
{"answers": "Many patients do not understand their ED care or their discharge instructions. Moreover, most patients appear to be unaware of their lack of understanding and report inappropriate confidence in their comprehension and recall.", "prediction_text": "Patients are often unaware of their comprehension of ED care and instructions. The present study suggests that patients are not aware of their comprehension of ED care and instructions."}
{"answers": "The results of this study suggest that normothermic CPB does not prevent the development of the \"euthyroid sick syndrome\" during and after CPB. Despite these changes in thyroid function, most patients in both groups had a normal postoperative recovery.", "prediction_text": "The present study does not support the recommendation of hypothermic CPB as a conclusive diagnostic tool for postoperative thyroid dysfunction."}
{"answers": "Severe hypoglycaemia is associated with an increased risk for CV outcomes in people at high CV risk and dysglycaemia. Although allocation to insulin glargine vs. standard care was associated with an increased risk of severe and non-severe hypoglycaemia, the relative risk of CV outcomes with hypoglycaemia was lower with insulin glargine-based glucose-lowering therapy than with the standard glycaemic control. Trial Registration (ORIGIN ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00069784).", "prediction_text": "Yes, hypoglycaemia caused by glucose-lowering therapy has been linked to cardiovascular events. The ORIGIN trial provides an opportunity to further assess this relationship. A total of 12 537 participants with dysglycaemia and high CV-risk were randomized to basal insulin glargine titrated to a fasting glucose of \u2264 5.3 mmol/L (95 mg/dL) or standard glycaemic care. Non-severe hypoglycaemia was defined as symptoms confirmed by glucose \u2264 54 mg/dL and severe hypoglycaemia as a requirement for assistance or glucose \u2264 36 mg/dL. Outcomes were: (i) the composite of CV death, non-f"}
{"answers": "EDWS is a safe and effective treatment for esophagogastric varices secondary to portal hypertension in selected patients. Patients treated with EDWS had a lower complication rate of portal venous system thrombosis compared with those treated with conventional MED.", "prediction_text": "Esophagogastric devascularization without splenectomy is a safe and effective procedure for the treatment of portal hypertension. It is recommended for patients with portal hypertension who are not suitable for splenectomy."}
{"answers": "Significant postoperative pain can be expected in the following situations: pain after prior surgery, presence of chronic pain sustained for more than six months, intense preoperative pain, state of depression.", "prediction_text": "The postoperative pain level can be predicted preoperatively in patients undergoing shoulder surgery. The intensity of the postoperative pain is correlated with a prior history of surgical pain, duration of prior pain, and psychological context."}
{"answers": "The general practice selection process is predictive of future performance in the MRCGP.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that general practice selection scores are positively correlated with examination performance in the MRCGP."}
{"answers": "Although the association of prostate and lung cancer is uncommon, the possibility of synchronous tumors should be considered in patients with urinary and pulmonary symptoms suggestive of neoplasm. It is important to determine if the lesion is a metastasis, since the prognosis depends on the second tumor.", "prediction_text": "Prostatic syndrome and pleural effusion are two different diseases. The present study suggests that the two are distinct entities."}
{"answers": "The practice of intensive observation for the first transfusion in pediatric patients is probably unnecessary.", "prediction_text": "The present study does not support the recommendation of intensive monitoring during the first transfusion in pediatric patients."}
{"answers": "There is no indication of a rebound aggravation of symptoms 12 to 14 days after a 5-day treatment with lansoprazole 60 mg once daily in patients with reflux symptoms.", "prediction_text": "The present study does not support the recommendation of short-term treatment with proton pump inhibitors as a conclusive diagnostic tool for heartburn and regurgitation."}
{"answers": "Our long-term study showed significantly better (2-fold) results regarding the continence score for the abdominal approach compared with the transanal pull-through. The stool pattern and enterocolitis scores were somewhat better for the TERPT group. These findings raise an important issue about the current surgical management of HD; however, more cases will need to be studied before a definitive conclusion can be drawn.", "prediction_text": "The long-term results of the transanal pull-through are similar to those of the transabdominal pull-through. However, the age of the patient at the time of the pull-through may affect the long-term outcome."}
{"answers": "The current study revealed an increase in health care services utilization from 2001 to 2009 in the older Spanish population.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the prevalence of health care services use among elderly people has increased over the last decade (2001-2009)."}
{"answers": "It is concluded from the study that this knowledge if applied to dead human subjects, may preserve dead bodies temporarily allowing delayed funeral.", "prediction_text": "Raksi can be used for embalming purposes in the absence of formal embalming fluid. It can be used for preserving dead bodies for a short period of time."}
{"answers": "The Holmium:YAG laser is an ideal intracorporeal lithotripter for ureteral calculi, with a high success rate and low morbidity.", "prediction_text": "The holmium:YAG laser is a safe and effective method for the treatment of ureteral stones.
