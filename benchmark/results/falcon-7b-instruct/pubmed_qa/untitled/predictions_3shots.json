{"answers": "These data indicate that major blunt trauma enhances the migratory capacity of circulating neutrophils. This is manifest within 2 hrs of admission and may be attributable to alteration in interleukin-8 receptor expression, affinity, or downstream signaling. In patients who later develop ARDS, initially elevated circulating neutrophil counts decrease rapidly, over the same time course. Early enhanced neutrophil migratory activity coupled with elevated pulmonary concentrations of interleukin-8 may be central to the establishment of the neutrophil infiltration that is characteristic of ARDS.", "prediction_text": "Neutrophil migration in response to interleukin-8 is elevated in the lung of patients who later develop ARDS, and thus it plays a central role in the recruitment of neutrophils to the lung and their subsequent activation. This study suggests that enhanced neutrophil migratory activity in the early postinjury phase, before the development of ARDS, may be a crucial factor in the etiology of ARDS."}

{"answers": "In summary we believe sudden onset chest wall rigidity may be a significant and previously unreported factor leading to an increased mortality, from illicit IV fentanyl use. Fentanyl and norfentanyl ratios and concentrations suggest a more rapid onset of death given the finding of fentanyl without norfentanyl in many of the fatalities. Chest wall rigidity may help explain the cause of death in these instances, in contrast to the typical opioid-related overdose deaths. Intravenous heroin users should be educated regarding this potentially fatal complication given the increasingly common substitution and combination with heroin of fentanyl.", "prediction_text": "The lack of measurable norfentanyl in half of our cases suggests a very rapid death, consistent with acute chest rigidity. An alternate explanation could be a dose-related rapid onset of respiratory arrest. Deaths occurred with low levels of fentanyl in the therapeutic range (1-2\u2009ng/ml) in apparent non-na\u00efve opiate abusers. Acute chest wall rigidity is a well-recognized complication in the medical community but unknown within the drug abuse community.

{"answers": "Emergency laparotomy carries a high rate of mortality, especially in those over the age of 70 years, and more needs to be done to improve outcomes, particularly in this group. This could involve increasing acute surgical care manpower, early recognition of patients requiring emergency surgery, development of clear management protocols for such patients or perhaps even considering centralisation of emergency surgical services to specialist centres with multidisciplinary teams involving emergency surgeons and care of the elderly physicians in hospital and related community outreach services for post-discharge care.", "prediction_text": "Emergency surgery is associated with poorer outcomes and higher mortality with recent studies suggesting the 30-day mortality to be 14-15%. The aim of this study was to analyse the 30-day mortality, age-related 30-day mortality and 1-year mortality following emergency laparotomy. We hope this will encourage prospective data collection, improvement of care and initiation strategies to establish best practice in this area."}

The short stay ward is a cost-effective way of providing a safe and efficient service to children requiring emergency care."}
{"answers": "Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery is a safe method of treatment in patients with Cushing's disease. Operative findings, radiological and histological findings, together with early postoperative serum cortisol and urine free cortisol estimates may identify failures in treatment. Alternative treatment might then be required for these patients. Because of the risk of late relapse, patients require life-long follow-up.", "prediction_text": "The results of transsphenoidal pituitary surgery in patients with Cushing's disease over a period of 18 years indicate that the outcome is unpredictable and that factors such as age, sex, and the presence of associated endocrine disorders may influence the outcome."}
{"answers": "Patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms have a great diversity of functional somatic symptoms. They use more somatic and psychotropic drugs than controls in the years before diagnosis. Moreover, they show high rates of referrals and psychiatric morbidity. The diversity of symptoms of patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms supports the concept that symptoms do not cluster in well defined distinct syndromes. Therefore, patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms should preferably not be classified into medical subspecialty syndromes.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms are a distinct group, with a higher prevalence of somatic and psychiatric morbidity than controls."}
{"answers": "The vast majority of MDT decisions are implemented. Management alteration was most often due to patient choice or additional information available after the MDT. A minority of management alterations were 'unjustifiable' and the authors recommend that any patient whose treatment is subsequently changed should have MDT rediscussion prior to treatment.", "prediction_text": "MDT decisions are concordant with the patient's management in 91.5% of cases. The remaining 4.5% of discordant decisions are likely to be justified as the patient's choice or the MDT error."}
{"answers": "We found that 1.6% of S. aureus (all MSSA) from bacteraemic patients were PVL-positive. This low incidence suggests that PVL-positive S. aureus are of no particular significance as causative agents of S. aureus bacteraemia.", "prediction_text": "The majority of S. aureus bacteraemia in the UK is caused by PVL-negative strains, and PVL-positive strains are a minority."}
{"answers": "These findings are in accordance with previous experimental work and provide additional support for the assertion that dogs can prime autistic children for therapy.

{"answers": "Mucosal redundancy is a constant associated finding in IHPS. Although the origin of the redundancy and a cause-and-effect relationship are difficult to establish, our findings support the hypothesis that hypergastrinemia may be implicated in the pathogenesis of IHPS, and suggest that mucosal thickening could be implicated as one of the initiating factors in its development.", "prediction_text": "The pyloric mucosa is a constant finding in infants with IHPS, and may be a possible etiologic factor in the development of IHPS."}
{"answers": "Given the available screening technologies, discordant TEOAE and AABR may be inevitable for some categories of hearing loss among apparently healthy newborns whose mothers received prenatal care. The potential limitations of perinatal morbidities as basis of targeted screening for such cases therefore merit further consideration.", "prediction_text": "Discordance in TEOAE and AABR outcomes is predictable in newborns. Infants with false-positives are more likely to be delivered vaginally and have severe hyperbilirubinemia. Infants with true-positives are more likely to be delivered vaginally and have severe hyperbilirubinemia. Antenatal care status, mode of delivery and nursery type are useful predictors of discordant outcomes among all infants undergoing screening."}
{"answers": "GM of CRC and SLM was associated with fewer procedures but did not influence overall survival.

{"answers": "Our data have revealed a number of differences. Compared to the clinic sample, the Web-based sample had worse psychological symptom burden, younger average age, higher prevalence of employment, and a lower proportion on ART. For future research, we recommend that Web-based data collection should include the demographic variables that we note differed between samples. In addition, we recognize that each recruitment method may bring inherent sampling bias, with clinic populations differing by geographical location and reflecting those accessing regular medical care, and Web-based sampling recruiting those with greater Internet access and identifying survey materials through specific searches and contact with specific websites.", "prediction_text": "The recruitment setting (Web-based vs clinic) did not significantly affect the physical or psychological symptom burden of gay men living with HIV. However, those in employment were less likely to report being in the upper (worst) physical symptom tertile compared to those not in employment."}
{"answers": "The majority of acetabular components in this cohort were stable despite the small contact surface achieved between the component and pelvic bone. Three of 10 migrated in excess of the limits that predict later loosening in primary THA but it remains to be seen whether these limits apply to this selected group of frail osteoporotic patients. We continue to use this technique routinely to treat patients with the same indications, but since the analysis of these data we have added screw fixation of the acetabular component to the ischial tuberosity and the superior pubic ramus.", "prediction_text": "The use of oversized acetabular components with cup-cage reconstruction may provide initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures."}
{"answers": "Despite high perioperative mortality, results document a sustainable recovery of the survivors offering the prospect of a highly independent and satisfying life.

{"answers": "For conditions with a well-developed quality of care evidence base, such as hypertension and diabetes, a single structured implicit review to assess the quality of care over a period of time is moderately reliable. This method could be a reasonable complement or alternative to explicit indicator approaches for assessing and comparing quality of care. Structured implicit review, like explicit quality measures, must be used more cautiously for illnesses for which the evidence base is less well developed, such as COPD and acute, short-course illnesses.", "prediction_text": "Peer review of the quality of care is a useful tool for assessing the quality of care in the treatment of chronic disease. The results of this study suggest that peer review can be a useful tool for assessing the quality of care in the treatment of chronic disease."}
{"answers": "The high rate of unsuccessful IUD insertions reported here, particularly for nulliparous women, suggests that the true insertion failure rate of providers who are not employing additional tools for difficult insertions may be much higher than reported in clinical trials. Further investigation is necessary to determine if this is a common problem and, if so, to assess if the use of adjuvant measures will reduce the number of unsuccessful IUD insertions.", "prediction_text": "The rate of failed IUD insertions in community practice is higher than previously reported. The use of pain medication and cervical dilation may improve the success rate of IUD insertion."}

{"answers": "After comparing MR with arthroscopic findings and reviewing the available literature, we conclude that arthroscopy permits the direct visualization of even fine articular surface changes but does not depict the subchondral bone, the most frequent site of injury detected with MRI. MRI was a very useful tool in the detection and characterization of the different types of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries and showed a statistically significant correlation between site and distribution of bone and cartilage injuries and between internal damage and trauma mechanisms. Therefore, we believe that MRI can help avoid diagnostic arthroscopy in the patients with a history of post-traumatic pain, acute articular blocks and negative radiographic findings.", "prediction_text": "The role of MRI in the detection and characterization of occult bone and cartilage injuries in patients with previous musculoskeletal trauma of the knee is still a matter of debate. We retrospectively selected 70 patients (men:women = 7:3; age range: 35 +/- 7 years) with a history of acute musculoskeletal trauma, negative conventional radiographs, pain and limited joint movements. All patients were submitted to conventional radiography, arthroscopy and MRI, the latter with 0.5 T units and T1-weighted SE. T2-weighted GE and FIR sequences with fat suppression. We identified three types of occult post-traumatic injuries by morpho-topographic and signal intensity patterns: bone bruises"}

{"answers": ": Data from both association and expression studies suggested that variants at HINT1 may be associated with schizophrenia and the associations may be sex-specific. However, the markers showing associations were in high LD to the SPEC2/PDZ-GEF2/ACSL6 locus reported previously in the same samples. This made it difficult to separate the association signals amongst these genes. Other independent studies may be necessary to distinguish these candidate genes.", "prediction_text": "The expression of HINT1 is altered in postmortem brains of schizophrenic patients and unaffected controls. The HINT1 gene is a candidate for schizophrenia."}
{"answers": "Out of the four sacral sparing criteria, the acute phase anal sensory score measurements do not contribute significantly to the prognosis of independent ambulation.
