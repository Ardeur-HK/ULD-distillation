{"answers": "These results suggest the need to provide interventions that are specifically designed to increase awareness of potential stroke signs and symptoms and appropriate subsequent clinical actions.", "prediction_text": "The majority of elderly patients with acute stroke symptoms do not call 911. The correct endorsement of intention to call 911 is associated with higher levels of education and is a predictor of the likelihood of calling 911. The most common signs and symptoms of stroke are amaurosis fugax and weakness on one side of the body. The most common clinical scenario for which patients call 911 is the sudden onset of confusion or loss of consciousness."}
{"answers": "We conclude that routine CXR after bronchoscopy with TBB is necessary only in patients with symptoms suggestive of pneumothorax. In asymptomatic patients, pneumothorax is rare and usually small, so routine CXR is not necessary in this category of patients.", "prediction_text": "Routine chest radiography after transbronchial biopsy is not necessary in most cases of pneumothorax following flexible bronchoscopy. However, in some cases, it may be necessary to detect complications such as pneumothorax."}
{"answers": "Early surfactant administration is associated with shorter duration of ventilation but does not appear to be significantly protective against CLD/mortality among premature infants. This may support the growing evidence for consideration of CPAP as an alternative to routine intubation and early surfactant administration. Further investigation from large randomized clinical trials is warranted to confirm these results.", "prediction_text": "Early surfactant administration is associated with less duration of ventilation, longer CPAP and longer hospital stay, but has little or no impact on CLD/mortality."}

The choice of treatment should be based on individual patient factors and the severity of the disease. The treatment should be individualized and adjusted to the patient's needs. The treatment should be based on the patient's individual needs and the severity of the disease. The treatment should be individualized and adjusted to the patient's needs."}
{"answers": "PET data show that amoxapine's profile is very similar to that of the established atypical antipsychotics. These data, together with amoxapine's in vitro pharmacologic profile, effectiveness in animal models, and efficacy in psychotic depression raise the possibility of amoxapine as an \"atypical\" antipsychotic agent in the treatment of schizophrenia.", "prediction_text": "Amoxapine is an atypical antipsychotic. It is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) and has a higher 5-HT2 than D2 occupancy. It is used to treat depression and anxiety disorders. It is not used to treat schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders. It is also not used to treat Tourette's syndrome."}
{"answers": "In gravid ewes, intravenous infusion of<or = 1.67 micrograms/min epinephrine altered neither maternal hemodynamics nor uterine blood flow. To the extent that sheep data can be extrapolated to humans, these results suggest that continuous intravenous infusion of epinephrine in local anesthetic solutions is safe if the epidural catheter should enter a blood vessel during the infusion.", "prediction_text": "Yes, continuous intravenous infusion of low-concentration epinephrine decreases uterine blood flow in pregnant ewes."}
{"answers": "These data indicate that major blunt trauma enhances the migratory capacity of circulating neutrophils. This is manifest within 2 hrs of admission and may be attributable to alteration in interleukin-8 receptor expression, affinity, or downstream signaling. In patients who later develop ARDS, initially elevated circulating neutrophil counts decrease rapidly, over the same time course. Early enhanced neutrophil migratory activity coupled with elevated pulmonary concentrations of interleukin-8 may be central to the establishment of the neutrophil infiltration that is characteristic of ARDS.", "prediction_text": "Neutrophil migration in response to interleukin-8 is elevated in the lung of major trauma patients within 2 hrs of injury and may play a central role in the recruitment of neutrophils to the lung and their subsequent activation. This may be a crucial factor in the etiology of ARDS."}
{"answers": "Memory provocation increased the sensitivity of rCBF-SPECT for the detection of AD-related blood flow changes in the brain at the group level. Further studies are needed to evaluate MP-SPECT as a diagnostic tool at the individual level. If a higher sensitivity for AD at the individual level is verified in future studies, a single MP-SPECT study might be sufficient in the clinical setting.", "prediction_text": "Memory-provoked rCBF-SPECT can be used as a diagnostic tool in Alzheimer's disease patients. The left parietal cortex is the most affected area in AD patients. The use of memory-provoked rCBF-SPECT may be useful in the differential diagnosis of AD and normal controls."}

{"answers": "Gestational age misclassification is an unlikely explanation for the reported divergence in average birth-weights for Aborigines and whites. The results might help with the interpretation of other between-population comparisons.", "prediction_text": "The results of this study suggest that the difference in birthweights between Australian Aborigines and whites may be due to misclassification of gestational age. The results also suggest that the 90th centiles of birthweights are sensitive to even minor misclassification."}
{"answers": "W-d HCCs were clinically demonstrated not to be early cancer, because there was no significant difference in disease free survival between the patients with w-d and l-d HCCs.", "prediction_text": "The histological analysis of the resected specimens of w-d HCCs showed that the incidence of fibrous capsule formation was lower than that of l-d HCCs. The incidence of intrahepatic metastasis and portal vein invasion was similar in both groups. The disease free survival was similar in the two groups. The tumor volume doubling time in recurrent foci suggested that minute cancerous foci were present at the time of operation."}
{"answers": "The incidence of post-tonsillectomy late haemorrhage in our study population was 1.78%. A statistically significant difference was found between night-time and day-time haemorrhages. Even though no significant distribution of haemorrhages per hour was observed, we underline that we recorded 32 (54.2%) events in 2 periods of the day: from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. and from 6 to 9 a.m.", "prediction_text": "Post-tonsillectomy late haemorrhage is a night-time event."}

The growth rate of a neoplastic polyp is greater than 0.6 mm/mo, while the growth rate of a non-neoplastic polyp is less than 0.6 mm/mo."}
{"answers": "These data suggest that the R14C KCNQ1 mutation alone is insufficient to cause AF. Rather, we suggest a model in which a \"second hit\", such as an environmental factor like hypertension, which promotes atrial stretch and thereby unmasks an inherited defect in ion channel kinetics (the \"first hit\"), is required for AF to be manifested. Such a model would also account for the age-related increase in AF development.", "prediction_text": "The KCNQ1 mutation R14C is associated with atrial fibrillation in a family with a high prevalence of hypertension. The effects of the mutation on cardiac I(Ks) activation and atrial action potential duration are consistent with a stretch-sensitive mechanism. These findings suggest that the KCNQ1 mutation may be a genetic factor in the pathogenesis of AF."}

The postoperative complications are also related to the patient's age, the duration of the surgery, and the postoperative serum cortisol levels."}
{"answers": "Patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms have a great diversity of functional somatic symptoms. They use more somatic and psychotropic drugs than controls in the years before diagnosis. Moreover, they show high rates of referrals and psychiatric morbidity. The diversity of symptoms of patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms supports the concept that symptoms do not cluster in well defined distinct syndromes. Therefore, patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms should preferably not be classified into medical subspecialty syndromes.", "prediction_text": "The syndrome of chronic functional somatic symptoms is a single syndrome. The syndrome is a somatic syndrome, which means that it is a somatic disorder that is not caused by a medical condition.

{"answers": "The vast majority of MDT decisions are implemented. Management alteration was most often due to patient choice or additional information available after the MDT. A minority of management alterations were 'unjustifiable' and the authors recommend that any patient whose treatment is subsequently changed should have MDT rediscussion prior to treatment.", "prediction_text": "The majority of MDT decisions are concordant with the patient's management, but there are some discordant decisions. The MDT approach is beneficial for the patient and can be used as a model for breast cancer management. The MDT approach is a gold standard in breast cancer management. The aim of the MDT is to evaluate MDT decision making in a modern breast unit. All referrals to the breast MDT where breast cancer was diagnosed from 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2011 were included. Multidisciplinary team decisions were compared with subsequent patient management and classified as concordant or discordant. Over the study period, there were 3230 MDT decisions relating to 705 patients. Overall, 91.5"}
{"answers": "We found that 1.6% of S. aureus (all MSSA) from bacteraemic patients were PVL-positive. This low incidence suggests that PVL-positive S. aureus are of no particular significance as causative agents of S. aureus bacteraemia.", "prediction_text": "Yes, PVL-positive S. aureus are more likely to be resistant to penicillin and fusidic acid. The four patients with infection foci of skin and soft tissue, unknown, indwelling line, and surgical site were located at one centre in Wales, one in England and two in Ireland. One of four PVL-positive isolates was resistant to penicillin and fusidic acid, the remainder were susceptible to all antibiotics tested. Genotypic analyses showed that the four isolates represented three distinct strains; the two isolates from Ireland were related."}
{"answers": "These findings are in accordance with previous experimental work and provide additional support for the assertion that dogs can prime autistic children for therapy.

{"answers": "Our data have revealed a number of differences. Compared to the clinic sample, the Web-based sample had worse psychological symptom burden, younger average age, higher prevalence of employment, and a lower proportion on ART. For future research, we recommend that Web-based data collection should include the demographic variables that we note differed between samples. In addition, we recognize that each recruitment method may bring inherent sampling bias, with clinic populations differing by geographical location and reflecting those accessing regular medical care, and Web-based sampling recruiting those with greater Internet access and identifying survey materials through specific searches and contact with specific websites.", "prediction_text": "The Web-based sample of gay men living with HIV was significantly more likely to report being in the upper (worst) physical symptom tertile compared to the clinic sample. The clinic sample was significantly more likely to report being in the upper (worst) psychological symptom tertile compared to the Web-based sample."}
{"answers": "The majority of acetabular components in this cohort were stable despite the small contact surface achieved between the component and pelvic bone. Three of 10 migrated in excess of the limits that predict later loosening in primary THA but it remains to be seen whether these limits apply to this selected group of frail osteoporotic patients. We continue to use this technique routinely to treat patients with the same indications, but since the analysis of these data we have added screw fixation of the acetabular component to the ischial tuberosity and the superior pubic ramus.", "prediction_text": "Yes, cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups provides initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures."}
{"answers": "Despite high perioperative mortality, results document a sustainable recovery of the survivors offering the prospect of a highly independent and satisfying life.

{"answers": "Even in capped health care systems, virtual planning and guided surgery including prebent or milled plates are financially viable.", "prediction_text": "Yes, virtual planning and guided surgery with or without prebent or milled plates are becoming more and more common for mandibular reconstruction with fibular free flaps. Although this excellent surgical option is being used more widely, the question of the additional cost of planning and cutting-guide production has to be discussed. In capped payment systems, such additional costs have to be offset by other savings if there are no special provisions for extra funding. Our study was designed to determine whether using virtual planning and guided surgery resulted in time saved during surgery and whether this time gain resulted in self-funding of such planning through the time saved. All consecutive cases of FFF surgery were evaluated during a 2-year period. Institutional data were used to determine the price"}

Large-scale, adequately designed, prospective trials are needed to further confirm the value of Ki-67 in prognosis of UTUC patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, overexpression of Ki-67 is a significant prognostic marker for UTUC patients. The results of this meta-analysis suggest that high Ki-67 expression may be associated with poor prognosis and disease progression in UTUC patients."}
{"answers": "After comparing MR with arthroscopic findings and reviewing the available literature, we conclude that arthroscopy permits the direct visualization of even fine articular surface changes but does not depict the subchondral bone, the most frequent site of injury detected with MRI. MRI was a very useful tool in the detection and characterization of the different types of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries and showed a statistically significant correlation between site and distribution of bone and cartilage injuries and between internal damage and trauma mechanisms. Therefore, we believe that MRI can help avoid diagnostic arthroscopy in the patients with a history of post-traumatic pain, acute articular blocks and negative radiographic findings.", "prediction_text": "\"Occult\" posttraumatic lesions of the knee can be detected by MRI, but arthroscopy is more accurate in detecting these injuries."}
{"answers": "The prevalence of cognitive impairment in MND in this population based study of an unselected cohort was higher than has been previously reported.

The results of this study also suggest that the sensation returns to the nasal tip after microfat grafting."}
{"answers": "Conveyance of emotions or movements through music may be decoded differently by persons with different types of communication disorders. Because music is the primary therapeutic tool in music therapy sessions, clinicians should consider these differential abilities when selecting music for clinical interventions focusing on emotions or movement.", "prediction_text": "Yes, communication disorders that impair transmitting or decoding of structural features of music can result in atypical musical communication. The results of this study indicate that the CI group was less accurate in identifying musical emotions and movements than the TD-NH group. Mixed effects logistic regression revealed different patterns of accuracy for specific emotions as a function of group. These results suggest that the CI group may have difficulty in transmitting or decoding musical messages."}
{"answers": "For some patients, using colour to describe their pain experience may be a useful tool to improve doctor-patient communication.", "prediction_text": "Patients can use colour to describe osteoarthritis pain, but the choice of colour may depend on the individual's perception of pain intensity. The use of colour to describe pain may be useful in communicating pain to healthcare professionals, but it may not be suitable for all patients. The choice of colour may also depend on the individual's cultural background and their personal preferences."}

The ratio of cases with a number of leukocytes below the upper limit was determined respectively as 32.7% and 67.3%, and no statistically significant difference was found between the histopathologic study groups (P>.05)."}
{"answers": "Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mitochondria play a role in remodelling lace plant leaves during PCD. The lace plant produces perforations in its leaves through PCD, and mitochondria are involved in this process. The role of mitochondria during PCD in lace plant leaves is discussed in this paper."}
{"answers": "Our study emphasised the discomfort of transurethral urinary catheters, especially in male patients, and the high incidence of urinary tract infections in both sexes. Consideration should be given to the utilisation of alternative methods of bladder drainage, such as suprapubic catheterisation, which can be performed with ease during laparotomy.", "prediction_text": "Transurethral catheterisation is a routine part of major abdominal surgery and is associated with a high incidence of urinary tract infection. The present study suggests that male patients are more dissatisfied with the procedure than their female counterparts."}
{"answers": "Based on this pilot data, MASCC score appears promising in determining suitability for outpatient management of NF in gynecologic oncology patients.

{"answers": "Clinical predictors appear inadequate for the evaluation of the cervical spine in geriatric trauma patients with low-energy mechanism.", "prediction_text": "Clinical predictors are not adequate in the identification of cervical spine fractures in geriatric blunt trauma patients with low-energy mechanism. Neck tenderness is the only predictor that exceeded the expected occurrence in the presence of a cervical spine injury."}
{"answers": "European individuals with type 1 diabetes consume a high atherogenic diet as few patients met recommendations for dietary fibre and saturated fat. This study showed minor changes in dietary nutrients and energy intakes over a period of 7 years. Nutrition education needs particular focus on strategies to increase dietary fibre and reduce saturated fat to exploit their potential benefit.", "prediction_text": "Yes, European people with type 1 diabetes consume a high atherogenic diet."}
{"answers": "The gaps in patella eversion demonstrated smaller gaps both in knee extension and flexion position compared to the gaps of patella reduction position. The amount of decreased gaps was more definite in knee flexion position. Therefore, the intraoperative patellar positioning has influence on the measurement of the joint gap. Keeping the patella in reduced position is important during gap balancing.", "prediction_text": "The patella position can influence the ligament balancing in total knee arthroplasty. The patella subluxation and evertion positions can result in larger gaps in the patella position compared to the reduction position. The patella position can also affect the patella-reduced gap measurement."}
{"answers": "We have thus provided compelling evidence that there is a mossy fiber GABAergic signal. The physiologic role of this mossy fiber GABAergic signal is uncertain, but may be of developmental importance. Other evidence suggests that this GABAergic signal is transiently upregulated after seizures. This could have an inhibitory or disinhibitory effect, and further work is needed to elucidate its actual role.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mossy fibers release GABA."}
{"answers": "Men and women in this community sample reported similar patterns of depressive symptoms. No evidence that the presentation of depressive symptoms differs by gender was found.", "prediction_text": "No, higher rates of depression in women are not accounted for by differential symptom reporting. The gender difference in prevalence and incidence rates of depression is one of the most consistent findings in psychiatric epidemiology. This study was a population-based 13-year follow-up survey of community-dwelling adults living in East Baltimore in 1981. Subjects were the continuing participants of the Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area Program. Participants interviewed between 1993 and 1996 with complete data on depressive symptoms and covariates were included (n = 1727). We applied structural equations with a measurement model for dichotomous data (the MIMIC-multiple indicators, multiple causes-model) to compare symptoms between women and men,"}

{"answers": "These findings indicate that a relationship between multiple sclerosis and streptococcal infections may exist, but to acquire a better understanding of the role of group A streptococci in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, more studies with animal models are necessary.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant correlation between streptococcal infection and multiple sclerosis. The results of this study suggest that ASO and ADNase B levels in patients with MS are higher than in healthy blood donors. This may be due to the presence of a past streptococcal infection."}
{"answers": "Aplastic anemia is associated with a variety of autoimmune syndromes. The sequence of events in our patient suggests that the hepatic failure, AFOP, and the VSAA may all have been part of an autoimmune syndrome. AFOP could be the result of immune dysregulation in this pediatric case with favorable outcome after immunosuppressive therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, AFOP is a histologic pattern of diffuse pulmonary disease that is associated with severe aplastic anemia in children. The disease is fatal in most cases. The case described in this paper is the first nonfatal case reported in a child. The patient was treated with immunosuppressive therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The outcome was poor."}

{"answers": ": Data from both association and expression studies suggested that variants at HINT1 may be associated with schizophrenia and the associations may be sex-specific. However, the markers showing associations were in high LD to the SPEC2/PDZ-GEF2/ACSL6 locus reported previously in the same samples. This made it difficult to separate the association signals amongst these genes. Other independent studies may be necessary to distinguish these candidate genes.", "prediction_text": "The HINT1 gene is associated with schizophrenia in the Irish study of high density schizophrenia families and the Irish case control study of schizophrenia. The HINT1 gene is a candidate for schizophrenia."}
{"answers": "Out of the four sacral sparing criteria, the acute phase anal sensory score measurements do not contribute significantly to the prognosis of independent ambulation. The combination of the acute phase voluntary anal contraction and the S4-5 LT and PP scores, predicts significantly better chronic phase-independent ambulation outcomes than the currently used distinction between complete and incomplete SCI.", "prediction_text": "Yes, determination between complete and incomplete traumatic spinal cord injury is clinically relevant. It can be used to differentiate between patients with complete and incomplete SCI and can be used to guide treatment and rehabilitation."}
{"answers": "These findings suggest that schizophrenia is associated with progressive structural brain abnormalities, affecting both gray and white matter. We found no evidence to suggest progressive medial temporal lobe involvement but did find evidence that this may be partly explained by heterogeneity between studies in patient age and illness duration. The causes and clinical correlates of these progressive brain changes should now be the focus of investigation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there are progressive brain changes in schizophrenia. The findings of this meta-analysis suggest that the temporal white matter, parietal white matter, and lateral ventricular volume increase over time in schizophrenia. These findings support the hypothesis that schizophrenia is associated with structural brain abnormalities that progress over time."}
{"answers": "The elevated risk of death after CABG surgery known previously to be associated with CDM seems also to be shared by a group of similar size that includes patients with IFG and undiagnosed DM.", "prediction_text": "Yes, even impaired fasting blood glucose levels are associated with increased mortality after CABG surgery."}
{"answers": "This is the first known report of concurrent plasma and ISF concentrations of a meropenem antibiotic during CVVHDF.

The diagnosis of globulomaxillary cysts is based on clinical, radiological and histological findings."}
{"answers": "Although components of the CSM (cognitive and emotional representations, coping strategies) were associated with fears of recurrence, optimism was found to be the strongest predictor of fear, independent of anxiety and level of fear reported prior to treatment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, we can predict which head and neck cancer survivors develop fears of recurrence. The fear of recurrence is directly related to pre-treatment fears and optimism."}
{"answers": "Older adults enrolled in PICT with more symptoms may sacrifice QOL for experimental treatment.", "prediction_text": "Symptoms do matter when considering patients for phase I clinical trials. The symptoms of OA with advanced cancer are associated with poor prognosis and may be used as an adjunct in the evaluation of the severity of injury in these patients."}
{"answers": "Effective CPAP treatment in IPF patients with OSA results in a significant improvement in daily living activities based on the FOSQ, namely an OSA-specific follow-up instrument. Improvement was also noted in other questionnaires assessing quality of life, though not to a statistically significant degree, probably because of the multifactorial influences of IPF on physical and mental health. The probability of poor CPAP compliance was high and could only be eliminated with intense follow-up by the CPAP clinic staff.", "prediction_text": "CPAP therapy in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and obstructive sleep apnea can improve sleep and overall life quality parameters. However, it is important to overcome the difficulties in CPAP initiation and acceptance by these patients."}
{"answers": "Income support policy may be a significant new lever for improving population health, especially that of lower-income persons.

{"answers": "None of the clinical identifiers for early-stage adhesive capsulitis previously proposed by expert consensus have been validated in this study. Clinicians should be aware that commonly used clinical identifiers may not be applicable to this stage.", "prediction_text": "The lack of a recognized reference standard for diagnosing early-stage adhesive capsulitis remains problematic in all related research. The use of the local anesthetic as the reference standard for pain relief is a valid approach. The pain relief of \u226570% for passive external rotation was deemed a positive anesthetic response (PAR). The global loss of passive range of movement (odds ratio [OR]=0.26, P=.03) and pain at the end of range of all measured active movements (OR=0.06, P=.02) were associated with a PAR. Following stepwise removal of the variables, pain at the end of range of all measured active movements remained the only identifier but was associated with reduced odds of"}

{"answers": "Dutch primary schools could play a more important role in fostering healthy eating habits among children. The school food policy could be improved by clearly formulating food rules, simplifying supervision of the food rules, and defining how to enforce the food rules. In addition, the school food policy will only influence children's dietary behaviour if both the school and the parents support the policy.", "prediction_text": "The school food policy at Dutch primary schools is generally perceived as a positive development, but there is room for improvement. The school food policy is perceived as a positive development by 28.1% of the parents, 32.1% of the teachers and 39.8% of the principals. Most of the parents, teachers and principals believe that the school food policy should be enforced more strongly."}
{"answers": "Speed discrimination, per se, is not impaired in schizophrenia patients. The observed abnormality appears to be a consequence of impairment in generating or integrating the feedback information from eye movements. This study introduces a novel approach to motion perception studies and highlights the importance of concurrently measuring eye movements to understand interactions between these two systems; the results argue for a conceptual revision regarding motion perception abnormality in schizophrenia.", "prediction_text": "The results of the study suggest that eye-tracking abnormalities in schizophrenia patients are not a consequence of motion perception deficit."}
{"answers": "(1) There is little overlap between regions of CFAEs during AF and regions of SRF measured in the time domain or the frequency domain, (2) the majority of SRF appears to occur in regions with wave-front collision, (3) the distribution of SRF is similar in patients with AF and normal controls, suggesting that this may not have an important role in AF maintenance and may not be a suitable ablation target.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant correlation between complex fractionated atrial electrograms recorded during atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm fractionation. This correlation is 75% \u00b1 13%."}

Thirty RA patients (10 male, 20 female), with a median age of 61 years (range 42 to 84) and disease duration of 10 years (range one to 40), were recruited. All patients passed the sight test, whereas the reach and grip tests were passed by 77% and"}
{"answers": "The homogeneity we found in the deprivation-mortality relationship across the regions of Scotland and the absence of a contextualized effect of region highlights the importance of taking a broader strategic policy that can combat the toxic impacts of socio-economic deprivation on health. Focusing on a few specific places (e.g. 15% of the poorest areas) to concentrate resources might be a good start but the impact of socio-economic deprivation on mortality is not restricted to a few places. A comprehensive strategy that can be sustained over time might be needed to interrupt the linkages between poverty and mortality.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the relationship between deprivation and all-cause mortality is stable over time and across geographical regions. The rejection of the hypothesis of spatial heterogeneity in the relationship between socio-economic deprivation and mortality supports the stability of the deprivation-mortality relationship over time."}

Improving the analgesic management of pain in nursing homes is essential if high-quality end-of-life care in nursing homes is to be achieved.", "prediction_text": "Hospice care in nursing homes improves the management of pain at the end of life."}
{"answers": "The continuity-of-care experiences of vascular trainees are suboptimal. This is especially true for postoperative clinic assessment. Same-day admission surgery accounted for most of the cases and was associated with the poorest continuity of care. To provide complete surgical training in an era of changing therapeutic modalities and same-day admission surgery, vascular programs must be creative in structuring training to include adequate ambulatory experience.", "prediction_text": "Residents in an academic vascular department are learning complete surgical care. The rate of complete in-hospital continuity of care is 57%."}
{"answers": "Simple detorsion was not accompanied by an increase in morbidity, and all patients studied had functioning ovarian tissue on follow-up despite the surgeon's assessment of the degree of ovarian ischemia. Detorsion is the procedure of choice for most cases of ovarian torsion in children.", "prediction_text": "Oophorectomy is not necessary in most pediatric cases of ovarian torsion. The majority of the detorsion cases can be treated with detorsion alone, and the oophorectomy is only necessary in cases where the ovary is judged to be severely damaged.

The distance to the common peroneal nerve and the LCL can be safely measured with a flexible guide pin. The intra-osseous length can be measured with a specially designed guide pin. The mean intra-osseous length for 70\u00b0 of knee flexion was 25.2 mm, which is statistically significant when compared to mean intra-osseous lengths of 32.1 mm and 38.0 mm in the 90\u00b0 and 120\u00b0 flexion groups, respectively. There was a trend toward longer distances to the common peroneal nerve with increased knee flexion. There was a statistically significant"}
{"answers": "A proportionally longer treatment duration was identified as an adverse factor in low-risk patients. Treatment breaks resulting in a NTDR of>/=33% (e.g., four or more breaks during a 40-fraction treatment, 5 d/wk) should be avoided.", "prediction_text": "The nontreatment day ratio (NTDR) is an independent predictor of FFBF in prostate cancer patients receiving RT. The NTDR is not a significant predictor of FFBF in the intermediate-risk or high-risk groups."}
{"answers": "TEE allowed a diagnosis of site involvement that did correlate with the anatomic diagnosis obtained during the operation. This fact contributed to the management of patients and was of great help in guiding the surgical intervention. Echo-oriented single-valve replacement may be a safe strategy for patients with PVE and double prostheses.", "prediction_text": "The preoperative diagnosis of PVE in patients with both mitral and aortic prosthesis is accurate. Single-valve replacement is safe in patients with active PVE."}

{"answers": "Comparison of mother-offspring and father-offspring associations for BMI suggests that intergenerational acceleration mechanisms do not make an important contribution to levels of childhood BMI within the population. Associations at later ages and for different components of body composition now require study.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is an intrauterine influence on obesity. The association between maternal and paternal BMI and offspring BMI is similar for both parents. The strength of association between parental BMI and offspring BMI at age 7.5 is also similar for both parents. Taking into account correlations between maternal and paternal BMI, performing standardised regression and carrying out a sensitivity analysis for non-paternity emphasised the robustness of the general similarity of the associations."}
{"answers": "TEE is useful to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors. An FAC less than 50% is present in 36% of potential heart donors. Because left ventricular dysfunction is often reversible shortly after transplantation, an FAC below 50% may not necessarily preclude the use of hearts for transplantation.", "prediction_text": "Transesophageal echocardiography can be used to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors and can be a useful tool in determining the suitability of marginal donor hearts for transplantation."}
{"answers": "Pediatricians should be alert to the earliest manifestations of AEA. Awareness of choking games among the young and, of those, a subset who eventually progress to potentially fatal AEA is strongly encouraged among all primary care professionals who may be able to interrupt the behavior.", "prediction_text": "AEA is a clandestine and elusive practice. It is characterized by a secret pleasure that can lead to a lethal outcome. Pediatricians can identify the syndrome, demonstrate a willingness to discuss concerns about it, and ameliorate distress. A retrospective study of published cases, including personal communications, referenced citations, clinical experience, and theoretical formulations as to causation, was undertaken. Characteristic AEA manifestations, prevalence, age range, methods of inducing hypoxia/anoxia, and gender weighting are presented. All sources were used as a basis for additional considerations of etiology and possibilities for intervention. AEA can be conceptualized as a personalized, ritualized, and symbolic biopsychosocial drama. It seems to be a reen"}
{"answers": "The whole-body MRI protocol for the detection of bone metastases could safely be limited to the T1w sequence in adults, especially at 3 T. There is no need for an additional STIR sequence. These initial results will have a major impact on the department's workflow if confirmed by larger studies as they will help reduce examination time and therefore save financial resources.", "prediction_text": "STIR imaging can be omitted in the evaluation of bone metastases at 1.5 T and 3 T, as it is inferior to T1w imaging in detecting bone metastases."}

{"answers": "Location of death varies by country of birth. BAME groups are more likely to die in a hospital and less likely to die at home or in a hospice. Further investigation is needed to determine whether these differences result from patient-centred preferences, or other environment or service-related factors. This knowledge will enable strategies to be developed to improve access to relevant palliative care and related services, where necessary.", "prediction_text": "Yes, ethnicity does affect where people with cancer die. PoD is more likely in those born in the UK and less likely in those born in the Caribbean. Hospice deaths are less likely in those born in Asia and Africa."}
{"answers": "Overall, 7% of women in our cohort met either clinical or molecular criteria for Lynch syndrome. All of these women had a prior history or a first-degree relative with an HNPCC-associated cancer. Limiting genetic evaluation to women with synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancer who have a family history suggestive of HNPCC may appropriately identify women with Lynch syndrome.", "prediction_text": "Women with synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancers have a higher risk of having Lynch syndrome. The presence of a family history of HNPCC-associated cancers is a strong predictor of Lynch syndrome."}
{"answers": "CMV-IgM and IgG antibodies assessment was not a potential discriminative test to identify congenitally infected newborns. In addition, low birth weight and small head circumference at birth failed to predict congenital CMV infection. CMV-DNA detection in umbilical cord blood at the time of delivery using real-time PCR of all newborns is recommended as decisive, rapid and non-invasive test.", "prediction_text": "Yes, low birth weight is a risk indicator for congenital cytomegalovirus infection."}

The results of this study suggest that remote physician-examiners can be used to replace on-site physician-examiners in an OSCE."}
{"answers": "ACR is an independent prognostic factor for maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes in suspected preeclampsia. ACR may be useful to inform risk predictions within a prognostic model.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the first urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) in women with suspected preeclampsia is a prognostic factor for adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. The ability of ACR to predict future outcomes was assessed in both univariable and multivariable logistic regression models. The latter assessed its prognostic value independent of (adjusting for) existing prognostic factors. Primary outcome measures were maternal and neonatal composite adverse outcomes, and a secondary outcome was gestation at delivery. In all, 204 women (28.5%) experienced a composite adverse maternal outcome and 146 women (20.4%) experienced a composite adverse neonatal outcome. Multivariate analysis of log-transformed ACR demonstrated that a"}
{"answers": "The effect on venous pressures caused by the change in patient positioning alone during liver surgery does not affect the risk of venous air embolism.", "prediction_text": "The head-down tilt position does not decrease the risk of venous air embolism during liver surgery.

The M-H odds ratio is 1.4."}
{"answers": "Hospital preparedness can be better defined by a fixed number of casualties rather than a percentile of its bed capacity. Only 20% of the arriving casualties will require immediate medical treatment. Implementation of this concept may improve the utilisation of national emergency health resources both in the preparation phase and on real time.", "prediction_text": "The current guidelines for hospital readiness for multiple casualty incidents are based on the epidemiology of encountered HMCIs. The current guidelines are not specific enough to predict the surge capacity and injury severity distribution. The current guidelines should be revised to better predict the surge capacity and injury severity distribution."}
{"answers": "While Italian primary care physicians appropriately target eradication therapy for H pylori infection in patients with peptic ulcer disease rather than nonulcer disease, the intervention was still underused in these patients. Improvements in this prescribing behavior are needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, primary care physicians underprescribe antibiotics for peptic ulcer disease."}
{"answers": "When cerebral hemispherectomy is performed to control seizures associated with very early (in utero) insult, it has been found that the remaining right hemisphere is still able to support reading and phonological processing skills that are normally mediated by the left hemisphere. Our results also suggest the existence of variability in individuals after hemispherectomy, even within groups having the same etiology and similar timing of insult.", "prediction_text": "The isolated right hemisphere can read, but the reading abilities are significantly different from those of the left hemisphere. The right hemisphere is responsible for the processing of phonological skills, which are critical for reading. The left hemisphere is responsible for the processing of word reading and the reading of sentences. The right hemisphere is also responsible for the processing of the nonword reading, which is the reading of words that are not part of a sentence. The right hemisphere is also responsible for the processing of the reading of sentences, which is the reading of words in a sentence.

However, further improvements may be needed to better reflect the complexity of the disease."}
{"answers": "The Young-Burgess system is useful for predicting transfusion requirements. For the system to predict mortality or nonorthopaedic injuries, fractures must be divided into stable (APC1, LC1) and unstable (APC2, APC3, LC2, LC3, VS, combined mechanism of injury) types. LC1 injuries are very common and not always benign (overall mortality rate, 8.2%).", "prediction_text": "The Young-Burgess classification system can be used to predict mortality, transfusion requirements, and nonorthopaedic injuries in patients with pelvic ring fractures. The classification system is not as useful in predicting head, chest, or abdomen injuries. The mortality rate in the study group was 9.1%, unchanged from original Young-Burgess studies 15 years previously."}

{"answers": "Although the provision of high-quality evidence-based resources, electronic or otherwise, is essential for standardizing care and improving patient outcomes, the authors' findings demonstrate that this alone does not ensure uptake. It is important to understand end-users, the environment in which they operate, and the basic infrastructure required to implement such a system. Implementation must also be accompanied by continuing education and endorsement to ensure both long-term sustainability and use of the system to its full potential.", "prediction_text": "Web-based systems can be used to standardize care and improve patient outcomes in medical oncology. The uptake and use of the system can vary according to hospital location, clinician roles, and experience. Clinicians' attitudes toward and use of the system are also important factors. The system can be used to guide treatment across participating sites, but clinicians' needs for autonomy and perceptions of lack of time can impact their use. The level of education received regarding the system was also found to be integral to its ongoing use."}

When a risk was identified, generally a strategy was implemented. However, failure to assess some risk factors might have limited fall prevention strategies offered. Failure to adequately address risks during hospitalization could contribute to falls post-discharge. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2016; 16: 570-576.", "prediction_text": "The guidelines for preparing patients at high risk of falls for discharge home after rehabilitation are not met in the majority of cases. The guidelines should be implemented in order to reduce falls and fall-related injuries in this population."}
{"answers": "Although most Medicare beneficiaries who received a new CIED between 2005 and 2009 did not have an initial in-person CIED follow-up visit within 2 to 12 weeks after device implantation, the rate of initial follow-up improved appreciably over time. This CIED follow-up visit was significantly more common in white patients than in patients of other races.", "prediction_text": "The majority of patients with new CIEDs receive follow-up within 2 to 12 weeks, but the rate of follow-up within 0 to 16 weeks and 1 year is suboptimal. The rate of follow-up within 0 to 16 weeks has improved from 2005 to 2009, but the rate of follow-up within 1 year has not changed significantly."}
{"answers": "According to our study, there is a great variability when different brands and models of scanners are compared directly. Furthermore, the CT scan analysis and HU evaluation appears to gather insufficient information in order to characterize and identify the composition of renal stones.", "prediction_text": "The mean CT attenuation values of different CT scanners are not the same and can be used to differentiate between different types of urinary stones. The t-paired test showed that most stone types could not be identified. The mean CT attenuation values obtained with the Toshiba Aquilion were significantly different from those obtained with the Siemens Sensation and with the Philips Brilliance. At 120kV, mean CT attenuation values of uric acid, cystine and struvite stones obtained with the Philips model are significantly different from those obtained with the Siemens and the Toshiba but equal to those obtained with the GE 64."}
{"answers": "Ophthalmic pathology and basic science research show that SBK and ASA are improvements in excimer laser keratorefractive surgery compared to conventional LASIK or PRK, particularly with regard to maintaining corneal biomechanics and perhaps moderately reducing the risk of corneal haze. However, most of the disadvantages caused by wound healing issues remain.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there are differences in the biomechanical and wound healing characteristics of corneas after excimer laser keratorefractive surgery between advanced surface ablation and sub-Bowman's keratomileusis.

{"answers": "It seems quite admissible and justified to encourage medical students to officiate as examiners in undergraduate emergency medicine OSCE formative testing, but not necessarily in summative assessment evaluations.", "prediction_text": "Yes, student examiners can be reasonable substitutes for faculty in an undergraduate OSCE on medical emergencies. The effect size of the difference between the two groups was small."}
{"answers": "Expression of ER is a constitutional feature of the connective tissue and smooth muscle cells of the anal continence organ. Estrogen receptors and PR are not detectable in the striated muscle fibers of the external anal sphincter in either sex. The presence of ER in the stroma and smooth muscles of the anal canal suggests that these tissues are targets for estrogen. This constitutes a theoretical basis for the beneficial effects of estrogen and progestin replacement on anal continence in postmenopausal women.", "prediction_text": "The presence of steroid hormone receptors in the anal canal is a prerequisite for a hormonal influence on anal continence in women. The presence of ER and PR in the smooth muscle cells of the anorectal region is a new finding. The absence of staining for ER or PR in the striated muscle cells of the external sphincter in males or females suggests that the steroid hormone receptors are not involved in the development of anal incontinence."}
{"answers": "In women with bothersome MUI, concomitant AA repair does not result in additional improvement in OAB symptoms over MUS alone. Patients with postoperative complications exhibit less improvement in OAB symptoms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, concomitant anterior/apical repair during midurethral sling improves the overactive bladder component of mixed incontinence."}

{"answers": "Severe hypoglycaemia is associated with an increased risk for CV outcomes in people at high CV risk and dysglycaemia. Although allocation to insulin glargine vs. standard care was associated with an increased risk of severe and non-severe hypoglycaemia, the relative risk of CV outcomes with hypoglycaemia was lower with insulin glargine-based glucose-lowering therapy than with the standard glycaemic control. Trial Registration (ORIGIN ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00069784).", "prediction_text": "Yes, hypoglycaemia caused by glucose-lowering therapy has been linked to cardiovascular events. The ORIGIN trial provides an opportunity to further assess this relationship. A total of 12 537 participants with dysglycaemia and high CV-risk were randomized to basal insulin glargine titrated to a fasting glucose of \u2264 5.3 mmol/L (95 mg/dL) or standard glycaemic care. Non-severe hypoglycaemia was defined as symptoms confirmed by glucose \u2264 54 mg/dL and severe hypoglycaemia as a requirement for assistance or glucose \u2264 36 mg/dL. Outcomes were: (i) the composite of CV death, non-f"}
