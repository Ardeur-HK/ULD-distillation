The work done by the engine was measured in foot-pounds of work delivered by burning one bushel of coal. The best examples of Newcomen designs had a duty of about 7 million, but most were closer to 5 million. Watt's original low-pressure designs were able to deliver duty as high as 25 million, but averaged about 17. This was a three-fold improvement over the average Newcomen design. Early Watt engines equipped with high-pressure steam improved this to 65 million."}

After complement proteins initially bind to the microbe, they activate their protease activity, which in turn activates other complement proteases, and so on. This produces a catalytic cascade that amplifies the initial signal by controlled positive feedback. The cascade results in the production of peptides that attract immune cells, increase vascular permeability, and opsonize (coat) the surface of a pathogen, marking it for destruction. This"}

It can lead to a decrease in productivity, as women are often paid less than their male counterparts for the same job. This can result in a decrease in economic growth, as less money is being put back into the economy. Additionally, gender inequality in wages can also lead to a decrease in the number of women in the workforce, as they may be discouraged from entering certain fields due to the lower wages. This can also result in a decrease in economic growth, as the workforce is not as productive as it could be."}
