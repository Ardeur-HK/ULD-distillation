{"answers": "These data suggest that being willing and fit enough for a chemotherapy protocol is a good prognostic factor for invasive bladder cancer. This eligibility bias emphasizes the need for prospective, randomized trials, and indicates that single-group studies using historical or matched controls have to be interpreted with caution.", "prediction_text": "Yes, eligibility for an adjuvant chemotherapy protocol after radical cystectomy is a good prognostic factor for invasive bladder cancer. The study found that patients who were eligible for the protocol had better overall survival, recurrence-free survival, and a lower rate of cancer-related death compared to those who were not eligible."}
{"answers": "An additional delayed phase through the abdomen in routine contrast-enhanced CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis is of low yield, particularly if reliable follow-up imaging to further elucidate uncertain findings is available.", "prediction_text": "The study found that delayed imaging in routine CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis may not be worth the additional cost of radiation and time, as the majority of patients (95.8%) did not have any additional beneficial findings in the delayed phase. However, in a small number of patients (4.2%), incidental findings were detected in the delayed phase that could have been confirmed at noninvasive follow-up imaging. The most common findings were liver hemangioma, adrenal adenoma, and parapelvic renal cysts. The study suggests that the additional radiation exposure from the delayed phase may not be justified by the potential"}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that the SCL 90-R is best viewed as an indicator of unidimensional emotional distress and somatic effects of structural brain injury.", "prediction_text": "No, the SCL 90-R obsessive-compulsive dimension does not identify cognitive impairments in individuals with brain tumors. In fact, the subscale was only related to symptoms of depression, anxiety, and subjective complaints of memory problems, but not to objective measures of attention, verbal memory, or age."}
{"answers": "The results suggest that NA treatment can be stopped in selected patients with CHB as long as they are not cirrhotic, have completed a minimum period of treatment, have normal ALT and sustained undetectable DNA. These patients should be closely monitored during the first year and then indefinitely.", "prediction_text": "Yes, it is possible to stop treatment with nucleos(t)ide analogs (NAs) in patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B (CHB), but the rate of virological relapse is high, with 54.54% of patients experiencing a relapse within 6 months after discontinuation."}
{"answers": "The results of this study do not support the hypothesis that there is a direct link between atmospheric pressure values and abdominal aortic aneurysm ruptures.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the diameter of the aneurysm is important in determining the influence of atmospheric pressure on aortic aneurysm rupture. The study found that larger aneurysms (>7 cm) were more likely to rupture in situations where the atmospheric pressure increased between the day before the rupture and the day of the rupture, and this trend was more pronounced in patients with hypertension."}
{"answers": "Findings from these studies support discordance between device-recorded and self-reported hot flashes. In addition, the studies reveal further limitations of SSC monitoring, including difficulties with data collection and lack of consistency in interpretation. Based on these results and other recent trials identifying issues with SSC methodology, it is time to find a better physiologic surrogate measure for hot flashes.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the sternal skin conductance (SSC) device may not be a reliable measure of hot flashes, as the concordance rate between self-reported and device-recorded hot flashes was only 24%. While the women in the study found the device to be acceptable to wear, the poor conductance and battery failure of the first prototype and the limited accuracy of the second prototype suggest that other methods may be more reliable for measuring hot flashes."}
{"answers": ": Prophylactic fixation with a cephalomedullary nail was not found to be cost-effective for the average older woman who sustained a hip fracture. However, it may be appropriate for select patient populations. The study supports the need for basic science and clinical trials investigating the effectiveness of prophylactic fixation for patient populations at higher lifetime risk for contralateral hip fracture.", "prediction_text": "Prophylactic fixation of the uninjured hip is not cost-effective in the base-case analysis for a 79-year-old woman, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $142,795 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. However, prophylactic fixation may be a cost-effective method to prevent contralateral hip fracture in certain subgroups, such as women aged 71-75 years with a 30% greater relative risk for a contralateral fracture, or women younger than age 70 years. The cost-effectiveness of prophyla"}
{"answers": "We found that USMLE Step 2, number of honors in medical school clerkships, and AOA membership demonstrated the strongest correlations with resident performance. Our goal in analyzing these data was to provide residency programs at large a sense of which criteria may be \"high yield\" in ranking applicants by analyzing data from within our own pool of residents. Similar studies across a broader scope of programs are warranted to confirm applicability of our findings. The continually emerging complexities of the field of orthopaedic surgery lend increasing importance to future work on the appropriate selection and training of orthopaedic residents.", "prediction_text": "Yes, preresidency selection criteria can predict performance in orthopaedic surgery residency. Specifically, the study found that:"}
{"answers": "In vitro fertilization outcome is strongly correlated with both maternal ages, basal cycle, day 3 follicle, stimulated hormone, and antral follicle assessment. Antral follicle assessment was a better predictor of in vitro fertilization outcome than were age or follicle stimulated hormone. Antral follicle assessment may provide a marker for ovarian age that is distinct from chronological age or hormonal markers.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that baseline antral follicle assessment may be a better predictor of in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcome than maternal age and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels. The study found that the clinical pregnancy rate was significantly higher in the group with baseline antral follicle >6 compared to the group with antral follicle < or = 6, even after controlling for patient age and basal FSH levels. Additionally, the cancellation rate was significantly higher in the group with baseline antral follicle < or = 6 compared to the group with antral follic"}
{"answers": "Neither insertion of PEG tubes nor timing of insertion affect survival.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, feeding tube insertion and its timing do not improve survival in patients with advanced cognitive impairment and new problems eating. After adjusting for selection bias using propensity score weights, the hazard ratio for survival between the feeding tube group and the no feeding tube group was 1.03, indicating no significant difference in survival between the two groups. Additionally, the timing of PEG tube insertion relative to the onset of eating problems was not associated with survival."}
{"answers": "In this well established early discharge program with nurse home visits, newborn metabolic screening is not compromised by early discharge.", "prediction_text": "Early discharge newborns were less likely to have adequate metabolic screening specimens compared to traditional stay newborns, but had a higher rate of repeat specimens when the initial specimen was inadequate. Early discharge newborns were also more likely to have an adequate specimen within the first 9 days of life. Overall, early discharge with nurse home visits may have a negative impact on the adequacy of newborn metabolic screening."}
{"answers": "The palliative treatment concept of 25\u00a0Gy applied in 5\u00a0fractions is sufficient for radiation of lung cancer, given that there was no obvious survival improvement in patients treated with the higher total dose regimen.", "prediction_text": "The study found that there was no significant difference in overall survival between patients treated with 25 Gy in 5 fractions and those treated with 50 Gy in 20 fractions. However, there was a trend towards longer survival in patients with a good-fair overall condition when treated with the higher dose."}
{"answers": "Although elevated leukocyte count and CRP value cannot effectively establish the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the elderly, unelevated values exclude it. Accordingly, appendectomy is not recommended to be performed in an elderly patient with unelevated leukocyte count and CRP value, although clinical symptoms and signs indicate acute appendicitis.", "prediction_text": "The study found that there was no significant difference in leukocyte counts or CRP values between patients with an uninflamed appendix and those with acute appendicitis in the elderly population. However, the study did find that there were no patients in the acute appendicitis group with both leukocyte count and CRP values that were within the normal range, suggesting that both markers may be useful in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the elderly."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrates that in patients at risk for cardiac morbidity undergoing vascular surgery, desflurane is effective to control intraoperative hypertension without fear of major cardiac depressant effect.", "prediction_text": "Yes, desflurane can alter left ventricular function when used to control surgical stimulation during aortic surgery. The study found that the addition of desflurane to control hypertension during surgery resulted in an increase in afterload, as measured by systemic vascular resistance index, end-systolic wall stress, and left-ventricular stroke work index. However, there were no changes in heart rate, cardiac index, mean pulmonary arterial pressure, stroke volume, end-diastolic and end-systolic cross-sectional areas, fractional area change, or left ventricular circumferential fiber shortening."}
{"answers": "Development of tolerance to gluten seems possible in some patients with CD. Further follow-up will show whether this tolerance is permanent or only a long-term return to latency. This feature may be associated with genetic characteristics, especially with HLA genotypes that differ from DQ2 or DQ8. More insight into the mechanisms of the development of gluten tolerance may help to distinguish those CD patients that might not require life-long GFD.", "prediction_text": "Of the 53 patients with biopsy-proven CD who were followed for at least 20 years, 23% had a gluten-containing diet, 15% admitted to accidental gluten exposure, and 62% followed the gluten-free diet (GFD). Only two patients were considered to have developed tolerance to gluten, and one of them was HLA-DQ2/DQ8 negative."}
{"answers": "No home-prepared replacement milks in South Africa meet all estimated micronutrient and essential fatty acid requirements of infants aged<6 months. Commercial infant formula is the only replacement milk that meets all nutritional needs. Revisions of WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF HIV and infant feeding course replacement milk options are needed. If replacement milks are to provide total nutrition, preparations should include vegetable oils, such as soybean oil, as a source of linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids, and additional vitamins and minerals.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF-recommended replacement milks for infants of HIV-infected mothers in a rural region of KwaZulu Natal, South Africa, are not entirely appropriate in terms of nutritional adequacy, cost, and preparation time. While the milks provided some essential nutrients, they were often inadequate in terms of vitamins and minerals, particularly zinc, pantothenic acid, and niacin. Additionally, the cost of preparing the milks was found to be relatively high compared to the average monthly income of domestic or shop workers in the area. The study suggests"}
{"answers": "We have shown that eosinophilic inflammation of the airway wall may increase PD and that the association of eosinophil counts with ICSs may result in lessening the PD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) appear to affect the perception of dyspnea during bronchoconstriction in asthma patients. The study found that ICS-treated patients had a lower VAS score for dyspnea during a methacholine-induced FEV1 decrease compared to ICS-naive patients. Additionally, eosinophil counts and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) were found to be negatively associated with PD in ICS-treated patients, while eosinophil counts were positively associated with PD in ICS-naive patients. These findings suggest that ICSs may have"}
{"answers": "High socioeconomic status was associated with a higher acceptance rate of preventive home visits, but the association was attenuated by invitational procedures. The results indicate that the social inequality in acceptance of publicly offered preventive services might decrease if municipalities adopt more proactive invitational procedures.", "prediction_text": "Yes, acceptance rates of a national preventive home visit program for older people are socially imbalanced, with older people from higher socioeconomic backgrounds being more likely to accept the program than those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. The association between socioeconomic status and acceptance was attenuated when adjusting for invitational procedures, suggesting that the way in which the program is promoted and invitations are issued may influence the acceptance rate."}
{"answers": "In the present study, FT and androstenedione were statistically significantly correlated with sexual desire in the total cohort of women. ADT-G did not correlate more strongly than circulating androgens with sexual desire and is therefore not superior to measuring circulating androgens by mass spectrometry.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a correlation between androgens and sexual desire in women. The study found that sexual desire correlated with circulating androgens, such as total testosterone (TT), calculated free testosterone (FT), androstenedione, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), in both the total cohort of women and in a subgroup of women aged 25-44 years who were not using systemic hormonal contraception. Additionally, in women aged 45-65 years, androstenedione correlated with sexual desire. However, the study did not find a correlation between the primary androgen metabolite androster"}
{"answers": "The results of these analyses suggest that marginally higher rates of depression to age 35 amongst the comorbid MD/AUD group were explained by increased exposure to adverse childhood circumstances amongst members of the comorbid group. Adolescent MD/AUD comorbidity is likely to be a risk marker, rather than a causal factor in subsequent MD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, comorbidity of major depression (MD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD) in adolescence is associated with poorer outcomes of MD in adulthood, after adjusting for confounding factors such as gender, childhood behavior problems, and exposure to abuse."}
{"answers": "There are no statistically apparent motion differences between SUP-CTV and INF-CTV. Current uniform planning target volume (PTV) margins are adequate to cover both portions of the CTV.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no statistically significant difference in target motion between the superior and inferior portions of the clinical target volume (PB-CTV) in patients with prostate cancer. The motion of the PB-CTV in the superior portion (SUP-CTV) did not differ significantly from the motion in the inferior portion (INF-CTV) in any direction (LR, SI, or AP)."}
{"answers": "Combined end points for adverse events are acceptable in the octogenarian. Carotid endarterectomy remains the gold standard for treatment of extracranial carotid disease in all age groups. Age alone should not place patients in the high-risk category for carotid endarterectomy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, octogenarians (patients aged 80-89 years) are considered high-risk for carotid endarterectomy due to the presence of various comorbidities, such as diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, and history of smoking. The study found that 4 perioperative neurologic complications occurred in octogenarians, including 1 transient ischemic attack, 2 minor strokes, and 1 major stroke. However, there were no deaths."}
{"answers": "Lysosomotropic amines in combination with cyclosporine appear to be synergistic in the suppression of T-cell proliferation to MiHC and MHC. Use of chloroquine in combination with cyclosporine may result in improved control of GVHD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, synergy exists between lysosomotropic amines (such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) and cyclosporine in immunosuppressing T-cell responses to minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHCs) and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens in mice. The combination of these two drugs resulted in additive or synergistic suppression of T-cell responses in vitro, with similar concentrations of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine suppressing T-cell responses to MiHC in mice, and lysosomotropic amines in combination with cy"}
{"answers": "The results of this study suggest that the cardiovascular response to exercise training may be different in men and women. Women may benefit more from interventions aimed to increase physical activity as a tool for prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.", "prediction_text": "Yes, exercise training has a significant effect on heart rate and QT interval in healthy young individuals, with trained individuals showing lower heart rates and higher heart rate variability compared to sedentary subjects. Additionally, there are gender differences in the effects of exercise training on the QT/RR slope, with a more pronounced effect in women."}
{"answers": "Although BD is correlated with GCS at presentation and RTS, it is not a reliable prognostic marker for outcome and mortality in patients with isolated TBI.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no statistically significant difference in the means of base deficit between survivors and non-survivors in patients with isolated severe traumatic brain injury."}
{"answers": "\"Aquagenic maladies\" could be a pediatric form of the aquagenic urticaria.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the paper suggests that syncope during bathing in infants can be a form of water-induced urticaria, similar to aquagenic urticaria. The study found that all six infants in the study had dermographism, and that blood histamine levels increased after a trial bath in two of the infants. The evolution of the \"aquagenic maladies\" was favourable after a few weeks without baths, but three out of seven infants continued to suffer from troubles associated with sun or water after a 2-7 year follow-up."}
{"answers": "Laparoscopic procedures caused detectable damage to Kupffer and endothelial cells as reflected by elevation of post-operative HA serum levels. The damage to the liver hepatocytes and perisinusoidal cells has no clinical significance and the laparoscopic procedure itself is the probable cause of the Kupffer and endothelial cells damage, while other mechanisms caused damage to the hepatocytes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, laparoscopic cholecystectomy appears to influence peri-sinusoidal cell activity, as evidenced by the significant increase in serum hyaluronic acid (HA) levels in patients who underwent the procedure."}
{"answers": "Sleep disorders are common in the general adult population of Japan. Correction for reporting heterogeneity using anchoring vignettes is not a necessary tool for proper management of sleep and energy related problems among Japanese adults. Older age, gender differences in communicating sleep-related problems, the presence of multiple morbidities, and regular exercise should be the focus of policies and clinical practice to improve sleep and energy management in Japan.", "prediction_text": "Yes, adjustment for reporting heterogeneity is necessary in sleep disorders. The study found that without correction for reporting heterogeneity, certain factors such as age, sex, and number of comorbidities were associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems. However, after correction, only age, number of comorbidities, and regular exercise remained significantly associated with sleep problems. This suggests that adjusting for reporting heterogeneity is important in accurately estimating the factors associated with sleep disorders."}
{"answers": "Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is often challenging in men on account of more adhesions and inflammation. This leads to higher conversion rates and more postoperative complications. Optimized planning and a more experienced operating surgeon may help overcome these problems.", "prediction_text": "Yes, sex affects the outcome of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Male patients are at higher risk of conversion to open cholecystectomy and biliary injuries, while female patients are at higher risk of gallbladder perforation and gallstone spillage."}
{"answers": "To uphold the notion for radiation exposure to be as low as reasonably achievable, ureteroscopic stone retrieval can safely be done without the use of fluoroscopy in a significant number of patients.", "prediction_text": "No, fluoroscopy is not essential for the retrieval of lower ureteric stones in this study. In fact, the study found that complete clearance without the use of fluoroscopy was achieved in 94.2% of patients. Only 4% of patients required fluoroscopy for various reasons, such as calcified strictures, duplex systems, narrow and tortuous meatus, and confirmation of spontaneous passage of the stone. Additionally, balloon dilatation was successfully achieved without fluoroscopy in 13 patients who required it."}
{"answers": "Surrogates of injury severity, including days in the ICU and non-ICU hospital LOS>10 days, were associated with the development of HO in our cohort of acetabular fracture patients. Prophylaxis with XRT was significantly protective against the development of HO, and the ability to provide prophylaxis is very likely related to the severity of injury.", "prediction_text": "Yes, surrogates of injury severity, such as length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU, and the use of external radiation beam therapy (XRT), were found to be significantly associated with the development and severity of heterotopic ossification (HO) in patients with acetabular fractures treated with a posterior approach, in a multivariate analysis."}
{"answers": "In this series of 35 patients, the use of epidural analgesia for HIPEC does not seem to be associated with a worse risk of haemodynamic instability, spinal haematoma, meningitis or epidural abscess. HIPEC with platinum salt is not incompatible with the safety of epidural analgesia, with an optimized fluid management peroperatively and the following of perimedullary anesthesia practice guidelines.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found no evidence of a significant risk of spinal haematoma, meningitis, or epidural abscess when using epidural analgesia for surgical treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis. However, there was a slight increase in thrombopenia and leukopenia in some patients."}
{"answers": "The Diabeo system improved glycaemic control in both high and low users who avidly used the IDA function, while the greatest improvement was seen in the low users who had the motivational support of teleconsultations.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that technology alone may not be sufficient to improve glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes. While high users of the smartphone-based intervention had stable glycemic control, low users showed a decline in informed meal choices and HbA1c levels. However, there was a trend towards improved HbA1c levels in low users who received support via teleconsultation. Therefore, while technology can play a role in improving glycemic control, it may be more effective when combined with other forms of support and intervention."}
{"answers": "Despite a lower risk of breast cancer, the Sami attended the NBCSP more frequently than the control group. The recall and cancer detection rate was lower among the Sami compared with the non-Sami group.", "prediction_text": "Yes, early outcome measures of mammographic screening in Sami speaking municipalities are influenced by ethnicity. The attendance rate and recall rate in the Sami population were lower compared to the control group, while the rate of invasive screen-detected cancer was not significantly different. Additionally, a lower percentage of breast cancers were detected in the NBCSP among the Sami population compared to the control group. These findings suggest that there may be cultural or access-related barriers to mammography screening in the Sami population."}
{"answers": "GP ablation did not prove to be beneficial for postoperative stable NSR. A complete left atrial lesion set and biatrial ablation are advisable for improving rhythm outcomes. Randomized controlled trials are necessary to confirm our findings.", "prediction_text": "No, ganglionated plexi ablation during Maze IV procedure does not appear to be beneficial for postoperative long-term stable sinus rhythm. The study found that the absence of GP ablation was not a significant factor in predicting AF recurrence."}
{"answers": "It is concluded that serum pancreatic lipase is a more accurate biomarker of acute pancreatitis than serum amylase.", "prediction_text": "Based on the study, serum pancreatic lipase may be a more accurate biomarker than serum amylase for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for serum pancreatic lipase was higher than that for serum amylase, indicating better diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, a lower proportion of acute pancreatitis patients had elevated serum amylase but not serum pancreatic lipase, suggesting that serum pancreatic lipase may be more specific for this condition. However, the study did not directly compare the two biomarkers head-to-head, so it is unclear whether ser"}
{"answers": "Transgastric endoscopic splenectomy in a porcine model appears technically feasible. Additional long-term survival experiments are planned.", "prediction_text": "Yes, per-oral transgastric splenectomy is technically feasible using a flexible endoscope in a porcine model. The study demonstrated that the procedure can be performed safely and effectively, with good visualization of the spleen and other intraperitoneal organs, and successful ligation of the splenic vessels and mobilization of the spleen."}
{"answers": "Brachial systolic blood pressure difference is related to the severity of SSS and can be used as a screening tool for SSS. However, it performed better in severe steal than milder steal phenomena.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the blood pressure difference between arms can predict the severity of subclavian steal syndrome (SSS). In this study, patients with complete reversal or alternating flow in the vertebral artery waveform had higher blood pressure differences between arms compared to those with systolic deceleration. This suggests that the degree of blood pressure difference between arms may be a useful predictor of the severity of SSS."}
{"answers": "a-tDCS could be useful in identifying residual connectivity markers in clinically-defined UWS, who may lack of purposeful behavior as a result of a motor-output failure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can be useful in differentiating unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) from minimally conscious state (MCS) patients. The study found that a-tDCS boosted cortical connectivity and excitability in all healthy individuals, MCS patients, and was able to unmask excitability/connectivity in some UWS patients. This suggests that a-tDCS may be able to differentiate between MCS and UWS patients, with the former showing preserved cortical connectivity and excitability, and the latter showing absent or reduced excitability/connectivity."}
{"answers": "Most people in France are influenced by situational factors when deciding if a physician should breach confidentiality to protect the spouse of a patient infected with STD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that lay people and health professionals in France generally find it acceptable to breach confidentiality to protect the wife of a patient with a sexually transmitted disease. The study found that the patient's intentions to protect his wife and to inform her of the disease had the greatest impact on acceptability, and that lay people and psychologists were more likely to find breaching confidentiality acceptable than physicians. Additionally, a cluster analysis revealed that there were groups of lay participants who found breaching confidentiality to be always or sometimes acceptable, depending on the circumstances."}
{"answers": "Most students do not encounter all 10 conditions during patient encounters throughout a 4-week EM rotation, although most have exposure to at least eight. Certain conditions are far less likely than others to be encountered, and may need to be taught in a nonclinical setting.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, the percentage of medical students who met the national standards for clinical encounters of selected core conditions in emergency medicine was 15.4%. This means that about one-third of the students did not meet the standards. The average number of conditions seen per student was 8.4, ranging from 7 to 8.6."}
{"answers": "The findings indicate that the clinical significance of symptomatic BDS is similar to that of CBD stones. Bile duct sludge seems to be an early stage of choledocholithiasis.", "prediction_text": "The study found that bile duct sludge (BDS) is less common in patients with suspected common bile duct (CBD) stones compared to those with CBD stones. Additionally, the presence of BDS was not associated with a higher risk of CBD stone recurrence after endoscopic therapy. However, the study did find that patients with BDS were less likely to have CBD dilation compared to those with CBD stones. Overall, the clinical significance of BDS is poorly defined, and further research is needed to determine its significance in patients with suspected CBD stones."}
{"answers": "Routine placement of nasogastric tube in patients operated of LSG seems not useful in reducing leaks' incidence.", "prediction_text": "Yes, nasogastric decompression may be useful in preventing staple line leaks after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. The study found that the incidence of staple line leaks was significantly lower in the group that underwent nasogastric decompression during the procedure (0% vs 1.4%)."}
{"answers": "The results obtained in this study demonstrate that LUS is an accurate and highly sensitive procedure in staging colorectal cancer, providing a useful and reliable diagnostic tool complementary to laparoscopy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, laparoscopic sonography (LUS) is a reliable and sensitive procedure for staging colorectal cancer, particularly for evaluating hepatic metastases. LUS had a sensitivity of 100% in detecting hepatic metastases compared to 62.5% and 75% by preoperative diagnostic means and laparoscopy, respectively. However, LUS had a low specificity (53%) for nodal metastases compared to 18% and 6% by preoperative staging and laparoscopy, respectively."}
{"answers": "Most community providers believe IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion; this belief is associated with increased resource use. Experts comply more closely with guidelines to diagnose IBS with minimal testing. This disconnect suggests that better implementation of guidelines is warranted to minimize variation and improve cost-effectiveness of care.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, experts in IBS were less likely than non-experts to consider IBS as a diagnosis of exclusion (8% vs 72%). This suggests that IBS is not considered a diagnosis of exclusion by the majority of providers surveyed."}
{"answers": "Correlation between level of radiographic transition zone on contrast enema and length of aganglionosis remains low. Systematic preoperative biopsy by coelioscopy or ombilical incision is mandatory.", "prediction_text": "The correlation between the radiographic transition zone on contrast enema and the level of aganglionosis on the specimen in Hirschsprung's disease is moderate, with an agreement of 58.1% and a kappa coefficient of 0.39."}
{"answers": "The presence of a high signal intensity change on T2-weighted MRI and the pyramidal tract sign can be used as prognostic factors for patients with CSA.", "prediction_text": "Yes, signs of spinal cord involvement, such as the presence of T2 high signal intensity areas (T2 HIA) on MRI, are associated with a poorer neurological recovery in patients with cervical spondylotic amyotrophy (CSA). Additionally, the presence of the pyramidal tract sign is also associated with a poorer recovery at the final follow-up after surgery."}
{"answers": "We conclude that not all low-tone sudden deafness (SD) patients suffered from endolymphatic hydrops even if they had vertigo attack at the onset and that electrocochleography (ECochG) was a useful prognostic tool.", "prediction_text": "The study found that low-tone sudden deafness (SD) does not inevitably progress to Meniere's disease. While some patients with low-tone SD experienced recurrent hearing loss, the majority did not, and there was no significant difference in the rate of progression to Meniere's disease between the low-tone and high-tone SD groups. Additionally, the average -SP/AP of patients with a single episode was smaller than that of patients with recurrent episodes and Meniere's disease."}
{"answers": "It is concluded that ACE-DD genotype may be a risk factor for the causation and development of chronic kidney failure among hypertensive patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that ACE-1 gene polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD) among hypertensive patients. The DD genotype of the ACE gene was found to be associated with higher levels of blood urea and serum creatinine, and the D allele was also found to be a risk factor for CKD among hypertensive patients."}
{"answers": "Older people with a history of amblyopia who develop visual loss in the previously normal eye can experience recovery of visual function in the amblyopic eye over a period of time. This recovery in visual function occurs in the wake of visual loss in the fellow eye and the improvement appears to be sustained.", "prediction_text": "No, the visual loss in amblyopic eyes is not permanent. In this study, 9 out of 12 cases of improved visual acuity in amblyopic eyes were found to have a history of amblyopia, and the mean improvement in distance and near acuity was 3.3 and 1.9 lines logMAR, respectively, indicating that visual loss can be improved with treatment."}
{"answers": "These results suggest that quantitative real-time PCR assays for BCRABL detection can be comparable between laboratories despite significant differences in methodologies if the same positive control cell line and quality control gene are used. It is imperative that some level of assay standardization be adopted between laboratories, not only for patients who are monitored at different facilities, but also for larger investigative studies in which hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular responses are to be compared.", "prediction_text": "Yes, correlated results are possible between different laboratories using homebrew assays for BCRABL transcript detection by quantitative real-time PCR. In this study, a strong correlation was found between the results obtained at two different laboratories using different methods, with a correlation coefficient of 0.9435 (p<0.00001). However, it is important to note that the results may not be identical due to variations in the RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, BCR control cell line, and PCR primer and probe sequences used in each laboratory."}
{"answers": "Although the exact mechanism of SSDH in this case is unclear, we speculate that this SSDH was a hematoma that migrated from the intracranial subdural space. Low CSF pressure because of continuous drainage and intrathecal thrombolytic therapy may have played an important role in the migration of the hematoma through the spinal canal. It is important to recognize the SSDH as a possible complication of the SAH accompanied with intracranial subdural hematoma.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the case report suggests that spinal subdural hematoma can be a sequela of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm, specifically a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The patient in the report developed a subdural hematoma in the lumbosacral region after undergoing a craniotomy for a ruptured internal carotid aneurysm, despite prophylactic treatments for vasospasm. The hematoma resolved gradually over time, and the patient experienced complete dissolution of the hematoma and gradual subsidence of their pain 15 weeks later."}
{"answers": "LAA occlusion device resulted in a slightly movement in QRS axis, reduced HR and increased the mean-mean QT interval duration. In addition, LA diameter and ARD seemed to be larger after device implantation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, LAA occlusion device altered the echocardiography and ECG parameters in patients with atrial fibrillation. After LAA occlusion, there was a slight and measureable movement of QRS electric axis, and significant differences were observed in HR and the mean-mean QT interval between pre- and post-operation for all patients. However, there were no significant differences in echocardiographic parameters between before and after device implantation. However, a larger LA diameter was detected by echocardiography during follow-up visits at 6 and 12 months, and a larger ARD was also observed during follow-up at 12 months than the bas"}
{"answers": "The study results suggested that spinal cord untethering may be unnecessary in patients with MM who are undergoing scoliosis corrective surgery and do not present with clinical symptoms of a tethered cord, even though tethering is radiographically demonstrated.", "prediction_text": "Based on the study, untethering is not necessary prior to scoliosis correction in patients with myelomeningocele. The study found that no patient experienced neurological complications such as new cranial nerve palsy, shunt malfunction, change in urological function, or upper extremity weakness/sensory loss after undergoing scoliosis correction without untethering. However, one patient did experience transient lower extremity weakness after surgery, which resolved within 1 month. The study suggests that untethering may not be necessary in all patients with myelomeningocele prior to scoliosis correction, but further studies are needed"}
{"answers": "Under the conditions of this study, pulpotomy offered a viable alternative to root canal treatment for teeth with vital pulps in the short term. However, there is insufficient clinical evidence to consider this technique for the treatment of every permanent tooth. Nevertheless, it should be considered as a potential alternative approach to be further developed for future applications.", "prediction_text": "Based on the study, the survival rate of teeth treated with pulpotomy and filling with ProRoot MTA\u00ae at 24 months was 82%. While two teeth required root canal treatment for pain control and one for prosthetic reasons, the study suggests that pulpotomy can be seen as a permanent treatment for premolar or molar teeth with vital pulps and without clinical evidence of irreversible pulpitis."}
{"answers": "The site of access in our study does not appear to influence complications specifically neural injury or recurrence rates.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no significant difference in early outcomes between patients in whom access was gained above or below the mid-calf level during endovenous laser ablation for small saphenous varicose veins."}
{"answers": "Retinal haemorrhages following a convulsive episode are rare. Such a finding should trigger an extensive search for other reasons, including child abuse.", "prediction_text": "Yes, based on the study's findings, it is suggested that retinal haemorrhages should be investigated further in children who experience convulsions, as they may be a sign of an underlying systemic disorder or child abuse."}
{"answers": "Clear and distinct differences between the two studied groups were found indicating the root of this increased confidence may have developed due to exposure to the Pathway program.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the Global Longitudinal Pathway (GLP) medical education curriculum has influenced medical students' skills and attitudes toward culturally diverse populations. A study found statistically significant differences in confidence ratings and similar qualitative findings between GLP and non-GLP students at the end of Years 2, 3, and 4."}
{"answers": "In normal daily practice, only a small number of clinically important adenomas are missed. The problem of missed adenomas probably is being exaggerated.", "prediction_text": "Based on the study, it appears that a small percentage of colorectal cancers (1.3%) may be due to missed adenomas during previous endoscopies."}
{"answers": "Emotional prosody, therefore, seems to be partially processed outside the focus of spatial attention. Whereas at early sensory processing stages spatial attention modulates the degree of emotional voice processing as a function of emotional valence, emotional prosody is processed outside of the focus of spatial attention at later processing stages.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the processing of affective prosody is influenced by spatial attention. The study found that the processing of emotional prosody differed depending on whether participants were attending to a specific location or not, with effects observed both at early and later processing stages."}
{"answers": "Pancreas retransplantation is a safe procedure with acceptable graft survival that should be proposed to diabetic patients who have lost their primary graft.", "prediction_text": "Yes, pancreas retransplantation can be a successful option for diabetic patients who have lost their primary graft. The study found that the survival rate of second pancreas transplants was close to the survival rate of the whole primary graft population, and significantly better than the survival rate of the first pancreas transplant. Additionally, pancreas retransplantation did not have a negative impact on kidney graft function and survival."}
{"answers": "Weekend hospitalization leads to delayed provision of intensive procedures and elevated 1-year mortality for elderly AMI patients. The existence of measurable differences in treatments raises questions regarding the efficacy of a single input regulation (e.g., mandated nurse staffing ratios) in enhancing the quality of weekend care. My results suggest that targeted financial incentives might be a more cost-effective policy response than broad regulation aimed at improving quality.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that hospitals provide lower quality care on weekends. Weekend-admitted patients were less likely to receive immediate intensive cardiac procedures, such as cardiac catheterization, angioplasty, and bypass surgery, compared to weekday-admitted patients. This delay in treatment led to higher rates of adverse health outcomes, including higher mortality and readmission rates for congestive heart failure, in the long term."}
{"answers": "The presence of more than one virus in hospitalized children with ARI is very frequent but it does not seem to have a major clinical impact in terms of severity. However bacterial superinfection increases the severity of the disease course. On the contrary, pneumococcal vaccination plays a protective role.", "prediction_text": "No, the presence of multiple viruses in children with acute respiratory infection (ARI) does not significantly correlate with the severity of the infection. However, bacterial superinfection is associated with increased severity, and pneumococcal vaccination is found to be a protective factor in terms of respiratory distress, PICU admission, clinical score, respiratory support requirement, and oxygen necessity. These findings were replicated in an independent cohort collected in the UK."}
{"answers": "In our study, it was observed that although longer ETA was associated with longer hospitalization, ETA was not correlated with postoperative complications. Our results inclined toward the position that appendectomy can be performed as a semielective surgery.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, delayed surgery (ETA>24 hours) was not found to be a significant predictor of increased complications in patients with acute appendicitis. In fact, patients with ETA>24 hours had a significantly longer hospital stay. This suggests that delaying surgery in this context may not lead to increased complications."}
{"answers": "Fetal gender does not affect the risk of having an ED visit for asthma during pregnancy, and it is not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes among women who had an asthma-related ED during pregnancy.", "prediction_text": "No, fetal gender is not associated with emergency department visits for asthma during pregnancy. The study found that among 530 women who had an ED visit for asthma during pregnancy, fetal gender was not a significant predictor of the risk of having an ED visit for asthma."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that working exposure increases the risk or leads to the clinical manifestation of rotator cuff tears. Although a detailed analysis of individual physical exposure is not available yet, the statistical results indicate that rotator cuff tears must be taken into consideration as a result of ergonomic exposure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that rotator cuff tears are more common among males working in certain occupations, particularly those in agriculture and forestry, and the building industry."}
{"answers": "High-quality training, strict compliance with evidence-based guidelines, and thorough documentation is associated with significant reductions in CLABSIs. Mindful organizing may lead to a better understanding of what goes into a unit's ability to handle peak demands and sustain extraordinary performance in the long-term.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the zero central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) rate is sustainable in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of the Floating Hospital for Children at Tufts Medical Center. The study found that the adoption and implementation of evidence-based measures for catheter care led to a significant reduction in CLABSI rates, which were maintained for over 600 days after the initial reduction. Key drivers of success included ongoing training, surveillance, and vigilance with catheter insertion and maintenance practices, as well as improved documentation."}
{"answers": "Ketamine sedation was successful and well tolerated in all cases. The use of atropine as an adjunct for intramuscular ketamine sedation in children significantly reduces hypersalivation and may lower the incidence of post-procedural vomiting. Atropine is associated with a higher incidence of a transient rash. No serious adverse events were noted.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that atropine is not needed with ketamine sedation in children. The use of atropine resulted in a lower incidence of hypersalivation, but a higher incidence of a transient rash. There was also a trend towards better tolerance in the placebo group. Based on these findings, it appears that atropine may not be necessary when using ketamine for sedation in children."}
{"answers": "Findings depict wandering and PNA as overlapping, but nonequivalent phenomena. Evidence supporting construct validity of wandering was more robust than that for PNA. Results have implications for accuracy in scientific and clinical detection and labeling of wandering and agitation.", "prediction_text": "The study found that wandering and physically nonaggressive agitation (PNA) are not equivalent concepts, as they are distinct and separate constructs. While there is a significant correlation between wandering and PNA, they are not the same thing and can be differentiated based on factor analysis."}
{"answers": "An advance care planning model is feasible for community palliative care services. Quality audit processes are an essential component of the Model with documentation of advance care planning discussion established as an important outcome measure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that an advance care planning model is feasible in community palliative care settings. The model was successfully embedded in the organizational structures of three community palliative care services in Victoria, Australia, and resulted in increased advance care planning conversations and family involvement."}
{"answers": "The study allows us to determine that FB can move through the body but not towards the heart. The study also serves as a warning sign: in cases of prolonged histories of FB ingestion, imaging studies are mandatory before endoscopic examination.", "prediction_text": "Yes, foreign bodies (FB) can migrate through the body towards the heart, a phenomenon known as \"FB walk to the heart.\" This can occur through various mechanisms, including the movement of FB through the mucosa, the bloodstream, and the lymphatic system. The study analyzed four cases of extra-lumen migration of FB, including two that migrated to the aorta and the neck area, and two that migrated to the prevertebral fascia and the submandibular region. The mechanisms and risks posed by FB migration, as well as the methods for diagnosing it, are discussed in the paper."}
{"answers": "Although most players in the study believe that rugby headgear may prevent concussion, only a minority reported wearing it. Coaches tended to be less convinced than the players that rugby headgear can prevent concussion.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, the players believed that the headgear could prevent concussion, but the coaches were less convinced. Only a minority of players reported wearing headgear and few felt that its use should be made mandatory."}
{"answers": "Early oral intake is possible after laparotomy and colorectal resection. Thus, the laparoscopic surgeon's claim of early tolerated oral intake may not be unique to laparoscopy.", "prediction_text": "No, early postoperative oral intake does not have to be limited to laparoscopy. The study found that patients who underwent laparotomy (an open surgical procedure) were able to resume regular food intake after resolution of ileus, which occurred at a similar rate as in the laparoscopy group. Therefore, early postoperative oral intake can be allowed in patients undergoing either laparotomy or laparoscopy."}
{"answers": "Both medial and lateral PTS were significantly steeper in failures of ACLR than the control group. Medial or lateral PTS \u22655\u00b0 was a new risk factor of ACLR failure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that failures of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) are associated with steep posterior tibial slopes (PTS). Specifically, the medial and lateral PTS were significantly steeper in the ACLR failure group compared to the control group. The odds ratio of ACLR failure for medial PTS \u2265 5\u00b0 was 6.8, and for lateral PTS \u2265 5\u00b0 was 10.8. These findings suggest that assessing PTS may be a useful tool in predicting the risk of ACLR failure."}
{"answers": "These results suggest the need to provide interventions that are specifically designed to increase awareness of potential stroke signs and symptoms and appropriate subsequent clinical actions.", "prediction_text": "Only 14% of elderly patients correctly endorsed their intention to call 911 when presented with clinical scenarios suggestive of acute stroke, according to a standardized questionnaire. Lower levels of education were associated with a lower likelihood of correctly endorsing the intention to call 911, while higher levels of education were associated with a higher likelihood of correct endorsement."}
{"answers": "We conclude that routine CXR after bronchoscopy with TBB is necessary only in patients with symptoms suggestive of pneumothorax. In asymptomatic patients, pneumothorax is rare and usually small, so routine CXR is not necessary in this category of patients.", "prediction_text": "No, routine chest radiography after transbronchial biopsy is not necessary, as pneumothorax occurs in only 2.9% of cases and symptoms suggestive of pneumothorax are present in only 7% of cases."}
{"answers": "Early surfactant administration is associated with shorter duration of ventilation but does not appear to be significantly protective against CLD/mortality among premature infants. This may support the growing evidence for consideration of CPAP as an alternative to routine intubation and early surfactant administration. Further investigation from large randomized clinical trials is warranted to confirm these results.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, the timing of initial surfactant treatment does make a difference in the rates of chronic lung disease or mortality in premature infants. The study found that infants who received early surfactant (within one hour of birth) had lower rates of chronic lung disease and mortality compared to those who received late surfactant (after one hour of birth). Specifically, the early surfactant group had a lower rate of chronic lung disease (40.2% vs 20.0%) and mortality (27.1% vs 10.5%) compared to the late surfactant group. However, the study also found that early surfactant was associated with"}
{"answers": "The study supports the hypothesis that nurses' aides who were exposed to ETS at home during childhood have an increased risk of long-term sickness absence.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that nurses' aides who were exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) at home during childhood had an increased risk of long-term sick leave, particularly for neck and back pain, and any illness. The risk was found to be higher for those who were exposed to ETS for a longer duration and for those who had a history of neck injury."}
{"answers": "We concluded that depiction of the superior wall of the mandibular canal cannot be improved by changing the thickness of images.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mandibular depiction can be improved by changing the thickness of double-oblique computed tomography images. The study found that the highest value for mandibular depiction was obtained with 0.9 mm-thick images in the alveolar crest and the whole of the mandibular canal."}
{"answers": "Exclusive CRT approach is not safe to treat patients with low infiltrative rectal carcinoma.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that chemoradiation therapy (CRT) may not be a safe option for treating mid and low rectal tumors, as there is a high risk of local recurrence even in patients who achieve a complete response (CR) after CRT. The study found that among the 10 patients who achieved CR, 8 experienced local recurrence within a short period of time after CRT. Additionally, the study found that the presence of lymph node metastases and perineural invasion were associated with poor overall survival. Therefore, it can be concluded that CRT may not be a safe alternative to surgery for treating mid and low rectal tumors."}
{"answers": "Random survival forests did not yield higher performance compared to Cox proportional hazards. We found improvement in prediction performance when coupling the genetic SNP score with clinical/demographic markers, which warrants further investigation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, multiple SNP testing in BRCA2 and BRCA1 female carriers can be used to improve risk prediction models in conjunction with clinical assessment. The study found that including both clinical/demographic variables and genetic SNP scores in multivariable models improved the predictive ability of the models compared to using either one alone. Specifically, the addition of a genetic SNP score to clinical/demographic variables improved the c-index by 0.006-0.008 in both BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers."}
{"answers": "Bedtime NPH insulin added to maximal therapy with sulfonylurea and metformin is an effective, simple, well-tolerated approach for patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, continuing oral hypoglycemic agents in addition to starting insulin therapy may be a better approach than starting insulin monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes. The study found that the insulin combination group (IC group) had better outcomes in terms of treatment failure, weight gain, and hypoglycemic events compared to the insulin monotherapy group (IM group). However, the difference in HbA1c reduction between the two groups was not statistically significant. Therefore, the study suggests that continuing oral hypoglycemic agents in addition to starting insulin therapy may be a more effective and safer approach"}
{"answers": "PET data show that amoxapine's profile is very similar to that of the established atypical antipsychotics. These data, together with amoxapine's in vitro pharmacologic profile, effectiveness in animal models, and efficacy in psychotic depression raise the possibility of amoxapine as an \"atypical\" antipsychotic agent in the treatment of schizophrenia.", "prediction_text": "Yes, amoxapine is an atypical antipsychotic, as it has high serotonin (5-HT)2 occupancy, greater 5-HT2 than dopamine (D)2 occupancy, and a lower incidence of extrapyramidal side effects compared to other typical antipsychotics, as shown in the study."}
{"answers": "In gravid ewes, intravenous infusion of<or = 1.67 micrograms/min epinephrine altered neither maternal hemodynamics nor uterine blood flow. To the extent that sheep data can be extrapolated to humans, these results suggest that continuous intravenous infusion of epinephrine in local anesthetic solutions is safe if the epidural catheter should enter a blood vessel during the infusion.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a continuous intravenous infusion of low-concentration epinephrine (0.125% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 or 1:400,000 epinephrine) impaired uterine blood flow in pregnant ewes, decreasing it to 68 +/- 14% of baseline."}
{"answers": "These data indicate that major blunt trauma enhances the migratory capacity of circulating neutrophils. This is manifest within 2 hrs of admission and may be attributable to alteration in interleukin-8 receptor expression, affinity, or downstream signaling. In patients who later develop ARDS, initially elevated circulating neutrophil counts decrease rapidly, over the same time course. Early enhanced neutrophil migratory activity coupled with elevated pulmonary concentrations of interleukin-8 may be central to the establishment of the neutrophil infiltration that is characteristic of ARDS.", "prediction_text": "Yes, increased neutrophil migratory activity after major trauma may play a crucial role in the etiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The study found that neutrophils isolated from patients admitted after major trauma exhibited an enhanced migratory response to high concentrations of interleukin-8 throughout the first 24 hours of admission, compared to normal laboratory volunteers. This suggests that the early post-injury inflammatory response may contribute to the development of ARDS by excessively recruiting neutrophils to the lungs."}
{"answers": "Memory provocation increased the sensitivity of rCBF-SPECT for the detection of AD-related blood flow changes in the brain at the group level. Further studies are needed to evaluate MP-SPECT as a diagnostic tool at the individual level. If a higher sensitivity for AD at the individual level is verified in future studies, a single MP-SPECT study might be sufficient in the clinical setting.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that using an episodic memory task provocation, such as memory-provoked rCBF-SPECT (MP-SPECT), may increase the diagnostic sensitivity of rest regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in differentiating between Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and normal controls. The study found a significant reduction in rCBF in the left parietal cortex in the AD group compared to healthy elderly, only when the subjects were provoked with faces and names."}
{"answers": "1. DBE is a safe and and accurate method to diagnose small bowel disorders; 2. this method permits chromoscopy, biopsies and treatment of the lesions.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) is an accurate method for diagnosing small-bowel disorders. The diagnostic yield was found to be 75% and the therapeutic yield was 63.6%. The study also found that DBE was able to identify the source of bleeding in 75% of patients with occult or obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, and it was able to diagnose a variety of other conditions such as duodenal adenocarcinoma, jejunal tuberculosis, and lymphangiectasia due to blastomycosis. The study did not report any major"}
{"answers": "Reorganization of care to offer a primary angioplasty service was acceptable to patients and their carers. Satisfaction levels were high regardless of the type of care received, with the exception of discharge and aftercare.", "prediction_text": "Yes, primary angioplasty is an acceptable alternative to thrombolysis, according to the study. Patient satisfaction with overall care was high at both intervention and control sites, and patients at intervention sites rated the speed of treatment as higher. However, carers at intervention sites rated the convenience of visiting as lower. During interviews, carers accepted the added inconvenience of visiting primary angioplasty sites in the context of this life-saving treatment."}
{"answers": "The leukocyte count at presentation can be used as an adjunct in the evaluation of the severity of injury in blunt trauma patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the leukocyte count at presentation correlates positively with the severity of injury, as measured by the Injury Severity Score (ISS), but negatively with the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and Revised Trauma Score (RTS)."}
{"answers": "Right ventricular recovery following PVR for chronic significant pulmonary regurgitation after repair of TOF may be compromised in the adult population. In order to maintain adequate RV contractility, pulmonary valve implant in these patients should be considered before RV function deteriorates.", "prediction_text": "No, the study suggests that pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) is not performed too late in adults late after repair of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). The study found that right ventricular volume and function remained unchanged after PVR, and the rate of maintaining a reasonable right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) was higher in patients with pre-operative RVEF > or = 0.40. These findings suggest that PVR can be safely performed in adults with significant pulmonary regurgitation late after TOF repair, and that timing of surgery may not be critical."}
{"answers": "Combined approach tympanoplasty (CAT) allows for successful treatment of cholesteatoma with rates of recurrent and residual disease comparable to open mastoid surgery. Early timing of second-look procedures allows easier removal of any recurrent or residual disease, which reduces the conversion rate to open mastoidectomy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, early second-look tympanoplasty can reduce the rate of conversion to modified radical mastoidectomy. In this study, the rate of conversion was 3% among patients who underwent early second-look surgery, compared to 10.6% among those who did not undergo early second-look surgery."}
{"answers": "In 1995, the first year that the MQSA was in effect, there was a significant improvement in the quality of mammography in North Carolina. This improvement probably resulted from facilities' compliance with federal regulations.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the implementation of the MQSA in 1995 resulted in an improvement in the quality of mammography in North Carolina. The percentage of facilities that met quality standards increased from the first inspection to the second inspection, with significant improvements in phantom image evaluation, darkroom fog, and developer temperature."}
{"answers": "HIE was associated with reduced repeat imaging in EDs. This study is among the first to find empirical support for this anticipated benefit of HIE.", "prediction_text": "Yes, this study found that health information exchange (HIE) is associated with a reduction in redundant imaging in emergency departments (EDs). Specifically, HIE was found to reduce the probability of repeat ED imaging by 44% to 67% in three common imaging modalities: computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, and chest x-ray."}
{"answers": "Gestational age misclassification is an unlikely explanation for the reported divergence in average birth-weights for Aborigines and whites. The results might help with the interpretation of other between-population comparisons.", "prediction_text": "No, gestational age misclassification does not explain the difference in birthweights for Australian Aborigines and whites. The study found that while the reported gestational age data can affect the estimated birthweight distributions, extreme types of misclassification are required to remove the divergence in median birthweights for the two groups."}
{"answers": "W-d HCCs were clinically demonstrated not to be early cancer, because there was no significant difference in disease free survival between the patients with w-d and l-d HCCs.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that well-differentiated small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may not be clinically early cancer, as there were no significant differences in the incidence of intrahepatic metastasis or portal vein invasion between the well-differentiated and less differentiated HCCs. However, the study did find that well-differentiated HCCs had lower incidences of fibrous capsule formation, which may indicate that these tumors are more likely to be clinically early cancer. The study also found that minute cancerous foci were present in the resected specimens, suggesting that well-differentiated HCCs may be"}
{"answers": "The incidence of post-tonsillectomy late haemorrhage in our study population was 1.78%. A statistically significant difference was found between night-time and day-time haemorrhages. Even though no significant distribution of haemorrhages per hour was observed, we underline that we recorded 32 (54.2%) events in 2 periods of the day: from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. and from 6 to 9 a.m.", "prediction_text": "Yes, according to the study, post-tonsillectomy late haemorrhage is more likely to occur at night-time (71.2%) than during the day-time (28.8%)."}
{"answers": "Biased estimates of asthma severity may contribute to racially disparate asthma care. Interventions to improve physicians' assessments of asthma severity and patient-physician communication may minimize racial disparities in asthma care.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that physician estimates of asthma severity were less accurate in black than in white patients. Black patients were more likely to have their asthma severity underestimated by their physicians, with a odds ratio of 1.39 (95% CI 1.08-1.79). This underestimation was associated with poorer quality asthma care, including less use of daily inhaled corticosteroids, less physician instruction on management of asthma flare-ups, and lower ratings of asthma care and physician communication."}
{"answers": "Many factors contribute to the erroneous reporting of hCG results, including (a) the complexity of hCG molecule and confusion of nomenclature on the various forms of hCG; (b) laboratory personnel's lack of awareness of the distinctions of the forms of hCG and failure to recognize the specificity of assays for their measurement; (c) lack of clarity and uniformity in manufacturers' reagent labeling; and (d) most product inserts' lack of information on the specificity of each method to the various forms of hCG.", "prediction_text": "No, laboratories are not reporting serum quantitative hCG results correctly. The study found errors in the reporting of intact hCG results as total beta hCG (9.3%) and total beta hCG as intact hCG (13.1%)."}
{"answers": "This study has shown that mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons concerning a certain issue is not sufficient to lead to a change in practice.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no significant change in the use of prophylactic nasogastric decompression in elective colonic resections after surgeons at the Royal Alexandra Hospital were mailed a summary of current evidence."}
{"answers": "These data suggest that either apoptosis is not involved in cell loss in MTS, or a very slow rate of cell demise may have precluded detecting TUNEL-positive neurons dying through apoptosis. Increased Bax expression and activation of caspases support the latter possibility.", "prediction_text": "The study found that there was no evidence of DNA fragmentation by TUNEL staining, which is a hallmark of apoptosis, in the temporal lobe specimens from patients with mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS). However, there was increased Bax immunopositivity and activation of caspases, which are indicative of apoptotic cell death. Therefore, the cell death in MTS may not be solely apoptotic in nature."}
{"answers": "Golytely was more efficacious than MiraLAX in bowel cleansing, and was independently associated with both bowel prep quality (BBPS \u2265 7) and higher adenoma detection. Golytely should be used as first line for bowel prep for colonoscopy. Studies with larger populations are needed to confirm these results.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant difference in the adenoma detection rate between MiraLAX and Golytely. Golytely was found to be associated with a higher adenoma detection rate than MiraLAX, with a odds ratio of 2.28 (95% CI 1.05-4.98, P = 0.04) in the multivariate analysis."}
{"answers": "Patient's age (>60 y) and large polyp size (>10 mm) were significant predictive factors for neoplastic GB polyps. GB polyps less than 10 mm in diameter do not require surgical intervention simply because they grow.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, the growth rate of a gallbladder polyp cannot predict a neoplastic polyp. The study found that older age and larger size of the polyp were significantly associated with neoplastic polyps, but the growth rate was not."}
{"answers": "These data suggest that the R14C KCNQ1 mutation alone is insufficient to cause AF. Rather, we suggest a model in which a \"second hit\", such as an environmental factor like hypertension, which promotes atrial stretch and thereby unmasks an inherited defect in ion channel kinetics (the \"first hit\"), is required for AF to be manifested. Such a model would also account for the age-related increase in AF development.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that a stretch-sensitive KCNQ1 mutation may play a role in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation, linking genetic and environmental factors. The mutation, R14C, was found to lead to altered channel kinetics and a leftward shift in the voltage dependence of activation, making the channels more sensitive to stretch. This suggests that the mutation may contribute to the development of atrial fibrillation in individuals with a history of hypertension and atrial dilation."}
{"answers": "The real-time PCR approach revealed promising results in pollen identification and quantification, even when analyzing pollen mixes. Future perspectives could concern the development of multiplex real-time PCR for the simultaneous detection of different taxa in the same reaction tube and the application of high-throughput molecular methods.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach can be a rapid, accurate, and automated tool for the detection and quantification of airborne allergenic pollen taxa, providing a new perspective for aerobiological monitoring."}
{"answers": "The Ambu SIB was able to accurately deliver targeted pressures across all three models from preterm to infant. The Neopuff infant resuscitator was unable to deliver the targeted pressures in the infant model developing clinically significant levels of inadvertent PEEP which may pose risk during infant resuscitation.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the Ambu self-inflating bag (SIB) provided adequate and safe manual inflations for infants up to 10\u2005kg weight, while the Neopuff T-piece resuscitator had difficulty reaching set peak inflation pressures and exhibited elevated positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) in the infant model. Therefore, the Ambu SIB may be a better option for manual resuscitation of infants in this weight range."}
{"answers": "This longitudinal study found no significant effect of menopausal transition on quality of life among Taiwanese women. The decline in the role limitations due to emotional problems was related to vasomotor symptoms.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, menopausal transition does not significantly affect the quality of life in middle-aged women in Kinmen. However, vasomotor symptoms, such as hot flashes, were found to have a negative impact on role limitation due to emotional problems after adjusting for other factors."}
{"answers": "The incidence of CPM is not increased in IVF/ICSI pregnancies compared with spontaneous conceptions. CPM probably does not account for the adverse perinatal outcomes following IVF/ICSI.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that IVF pregnancies had a lower incidence of confined placental mosaicism (CPM) than spontaneous conceptions, and the incidence of fetal chromosomal anomalies was actually higher in IVF pregnancies. This suggests that ovarian stimulation may not be the primary cause of adverse perinatal outcomes in IVF pregnancies."}
{"answers": "For risk stratification in emergency surgical patients, it is essential to measure the APACHE II score before surgical treatment. Longitudinal APACHE II scoring reveals continuous improvement of the score in surviving patients but has no therapeutic relevance in the individual patient.", "prediction_text": "No, the APACHE II score is not a reliable marker of physiological impairment in emergency surgical patients. The study found that the APACHE II score calculated after admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) was significantly higher than the initial score, leading to bias in the comparability of defined groups of patients and in the evaluation of treatment policies. Additionally, the predicted mortality rates based on the APACHE II score at admission to the ICU were not accurately reflected in the observed mortality rates. These findings suggest that the APACHE II score may not be a reliable marker of physiological impairment in this patient population."}
{"answers": "The methodologic weaknesses of the studies do not permit acceptance of increased risk of tubal pregnancy or infertility as a consequence of perforation of the appendix, so a causal relationship cannot be supported by the data currently available. Only a well-designed case-control study with unbiased ascertainment of exposure and adjustment for confounding variables will provide a definitive answer.", "prediction_text": "The evidence suggests that perforation of the appendix may be associated with an increased risk of tubal infertility and ectopic pregnancy, although the magnitude of the risk varies depending on the study and the specific outcome being assessed. However, the quality of the evidence is limited by recall bias and poor adjustment for confounding variables in some reports."}
{"answers": "Cancellous bone plays an important role in primary stability of mini-implants in the presence or absence of cortical bone.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the primary stability of miniscrews is related to the trabecular bone properties. Lower trabecular bone mineral density (BMD) and absence of cortical bone were associated with lower primary stability. Trabecular number, thickness, bone volume density (BV/TV), and cortical thickness were found to be correlated with primary stability."}
{"answers": "Despite recent efforts, a large proportion of newly confirmed TB patients could not adhere to standard TB treatment, and patients' lost to follow-up was still a serious problem. Poor treatment supervision and heavy financial burden might be the main causes for non-adherence. More needs to be done to enhance treatment supervision policies and financial supports to both health providers and TB patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that a significant proportion of TB patients in China (36.0%) were non-adherent to their prescribed treatments, and the loss to follow-up was high (28.2%). Factors that increased the likelihood of non-adherence included being observed by family members and paying monthly service expenses above 450 RMB, while supervision by home visit and phone calls were protective factors."}
{"answers": "While not providing conclusive evidence, this single institution experience suggests that neoadjuvant chemotherapy for Stage IV NPC patients improves both survival and disease control. Recurrence within the irradiated volume was the most prevalent mode of failure and future studies will evaluate regimens to enhance local regional control.", "prediction_text": "Yes, induction chemotherapy has a significant role in the management of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). In this study, patients who received induction chemotherapy had better overall survival, freedom from relapse, and local control compared to those who did not receive chemotherapy. Additionally, patients with poorly differentiated or undifferentiated NPC (UNPC) who received induction chemotherapy and controlled their primary and neck disease had a lower distant failure rate. The use of induction chemotherapy in combination with radiation therapy improved the outcomes of patients with NPC, particularly those with more advanced stages."}
{"answers": "There was increased expression of TGF-\u03b21 and VEGF in polyps compared to adjacent normal endometrial tissue. It suggested that these cytokines might play a role in endometrial polyp formation. In addition, there was a significant correlation between steroid receptor expression and VEGF and TGF-\u03b21 expression.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that endometrial polyp formation is associated with increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-\u03b21) in the glandular and stromal cells of endometrial polyps. Specifically, the expression of VEGF was significantly higher in glandular cells of endometrial polyps compared to adjacent endometrium in both the proliferative and secretory phases, and the expression of TGF-\u03b21 was significantly higher in glandular cells of endometrial polyps in the proliferative phase and in stromal cells of endometrial polyps in both"}
{"answers": "Primary eosinophilic esophagitis is characterized by fragile esophageal mucosa that readily tears in response to minor trauma during otherwise uneventful diagnostic endoscopy. This \"cr\u00eape-paper\" sign may alert endoscopists to the presence of the disease when other mucosal alterations are lacking. Dilation is effective for patients with symptoms with minimal morbidity, despite development of disquieting lesions in response to the procedure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the fragility of the esophageal mucosa is a pathognomonic endoscopic sign of primary eosinophilic esophagitis."}
{"answers": "Preoperative platelet count is a predictive factor for long-term survival in ESCC, especially in nodal-positive patients. We conclude that 205 (\u00d710(9)/L) may be the optimum cutoff point for platelet count in predicting survival in ESCC patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, preoperative platelet count is a prognostic factor in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The study found that patients with a preoperative platelet count \u2264 205 had a significantly better 5-year survival than patients with a platelet count > 205. Additionally, multivariate analysis showed that platelet count, T grade, and N staging were independent prognostic factors."}
{"answers": "From this study we conclude that there is no increase in testicular atrophy in patients less than 13 months.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the age at which orchiopexy is performed may affect the survival of the testis. In this study, testicular atrophy was highest for orchiopexy performed between 13-24 months of age, compared to those less than 13 months or greater than 24 months. However, after adjusting for location, age was not found to be statistically significant with postsurgical atrophy."}
{"answers": "The results suggest that a longer duration of treatment may prevent return into mental health care in some groups. However, because of the design of the study, no causal inference can be drawn. Further research, preferably in a RCT, is needed to determine whether the trend towards lower intensity treatments is associated with repeated mental health care use.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the duration of psychological treatment for depression is related to the likelihood of returning into treatment. Patients who received shorter durations of treatment (5-250 minutes, 251-500 minutes, and 751-1000 minutes) were slightly more likely to return for additional treatment compared to those who received longer durations (>1000 minutes)."}
{"answers": "Written information sheets contribute to the process of informed consent. As patients' recall of information is generally poor, the sheets may also be useful medicolegally, as a permanent record of what was discussed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a written information sheet improves the recall of information by patients compared to verbal information alone, with a significant difference in the percentage of correct answers in the written group (48%) compared to the verbal group (38%)."}
{"answers": "Although theoretically plausible, bicompartmental knee arthroplasty was not superior in knee muscle strength and physical performance at 1 year compared with total knee arthroplasty.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that there was no significant difference in isokinetic knee muscle strength, position sense, and physical performance between patients who underwent bicompartmental knee arthroplasty and those who underwent total knee arthroplasty (TKA) at any time point, including preoperatively, 6 months, and 12 months after surgery."}
{"answers": "These results indicate that T-cell deficiency may affect spatial learning performance following toluene exposure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, T-cell deficiency can affect spatial learning ability following toluene exposure. In the study, nude mice, which have a T-cell deficiency, showed impaired spatial learning ability compared to wild-type (WT) mice after exposure to toluene at 90 ppm for 30 minutes per day for 4 weeks. Specifically, nude mice had longer escape latencies in the acquisition phase and poorer retention memory in the probe trial compared to WT mice. These findings suggest that T cells play a role in the development of spatial learning ability in mice after toluene exposure."}
{"answers": "Histology usually demonstrated moderate to severe inflammation when VLEM were present. VLEM may be a highly specific endoscopic feature of esophagitis in children.", "prediction_text": "Yes, VLEM is a true endoscopic manifestation of esophagitis in children, with a high specificity and sensitivity for detecting eosinophilic esophagitis, particularly of moderate to severe intensity."}
{"answers": "At the gas flows studied, HFNC are not noisier than BCPAP for preterm infants.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no evidence to suggest that high flow nasal cannulae (HFNC) are noisier than bubble continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for preterm infants. In fact, HFNC was found to be quieter than BCPAP at low frequencies (500 Hz)."}
{"answers": "Patients with a history of ACD are at an increased risk of having recurrent preterm birth and cervical shortening in a subsequent pregnancy compared with women with prior preterm birth associated PPROM or PTL.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the clinical presentation of a prior preterm birth (SPTB) does predict the risk of recurrent preterm birth in a subsequent pregnancy. Specifically, women who had a prior preterm birth with advanced cervical dilatation (ACD) have a higher risk of recurrent preterm birth compared to those with a prior preterm birth due to preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) or preterm labor (PTL)."}
{"answers": "This illustrates that Paget's disease does exist in India and a high index of suspicion is required to clinch the diagnosis.", "prediction_text": "Yes, Paget's disease exists in India. The study found 21 patients with Paget's disease, with a male-to-female ratio of 2.5:1 and a mean age of 49.2 years at presentation. The most commonly involved bones were the skull and spine, followed by the pelvis, femur, tibia, and ulna. The serum alkaline phosphatase level was elevated in all patients at diagnosis and decreased after treatment with bisphosphonates."}
{"answers": "The results of the present study show that idiopathic incidental misty mesentery appearance has a significant prevalence. Also, the high body mass index of these patients and the growing evidence of obesity-induced inflammatory changes in adipose tissue are suggestive of an association between obesity and misty mesentery appearance on CT.", "prediction_text": "The prevalence of incidentally detected idiopathic misty mesentery on multidetector computed tomography (CT) is 7%. Obesity may be a triggering cause of this condition, as 67.5% of the patients were classified as obese and 17.5% as overweight."}
{"answers": "Percutaneous ethanol injection without aspiration of ethanol-mixed fluid seems to be the preferable method of treatment of benign cystic thyroid nodules from the perspective of both the physician and the patient.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no significant advantage in aspirating the ethanol-mixed fluid during percutaneous ethanol injection for benign cystic thyroid nodules. The success rates, side effects, and complications were similar in both groups."}
{"answers": "The present study, which is based on internationally accepted assessment tools for SLE patients, shows a significant relationship between increased disease activity and reduced physical function. This result emphasizes the importance of optimizing treatment aiming at reducing disease activity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there are significant associations between health status, disease activity, and damage in patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). The study found that increased disease activity was associated with reduced physical function, and greater damage was associated with reduced role function due to emotional limitations. Age and disease duration did not show any significant correlation with health status in this study."}
{"answers": "The morbidity associated with desmoid tumors has not been shown to differ, whether they arise after restorative proctocolectomy or ileorectal anastomosis.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no significant difference in the clinical course of intra-abdominal desmoid tumors between patients with restorative proctocolectomy and those with ileorectal anastomosis. The rates of complications, including surgical intervention, were similar between the two groups."}
{"answers": "These findings provide evidence for the existence of a high-IQ variant of schizophrenia that is associated with markedly fewer negative symptoms than typical schizophrenia, and lends support to the idea of a psychosis spectrum or continuum over boundaried diagnostic categories.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that there may be a clinically distinct sub-type of schizophrenia among patients with high intelligence, characterized by lower levels of negative and disorganized symptoms, better global functioning and insight, and a different pattern of symptomology."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that hearing loss caused by GM otic drops may be reduced by the inclusion of BM and benzalkonium chloride. Our finding that BM alone was associated with hearing loss suggests that the benzalkonium chloride may be the protective agent in combination otic drops.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that betamethasone (BM) did not reduce the cochlear toxicity of otic gentamicin (GM) in mice. In fact, there was a significant increase in hearing loss in the BM-treated ears compared to the untreated ears, and the GM-treated ears also showed significant hearing loss compared to the untreated ears."}
{"answers": "A fetal anatomic survey on follow-up sonograms may identify unanticipated fetal anomalies, especially when the indication is for fetal growth.", "prediction_text": "Yes, fetal anatomic assessment on follow-up antepartum sonograms is clinically useful in detecting unanticipated fetal anomalies, particularly for renal pyelectasis. The study found that repeated sonography for fetal growth evaluation yielded a higher incidence of unexpected fetal anomalies compared to other indications, and neonates whose mothers had sonographic examinations for fetal growth had a higher rate of neonatal interventions."}
{"answers": "Patients with BRAF-mutant PTC had a significantly longer PFS than BRAF wild-type when treated with TKIs. However, due to the small number of BRAF-mutant patients, further investigations are required, especially to understand the potential positive effect of BRAF mutations in RAIR TC patients while having a negative prognostic impact in RAI-sensitive PTC patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that molecular genotype can provide useful information in the management of radioiodine-refractory thyroid cancers. The study found that BRAF mutation status was associated with improved progression-free survival in patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Specifically, patients with BRAF-mutated tumors had a longer median progression-free survival compared to those with wild-type BRAF. However, the study also found that the histological subtype of the tumor, specifically the poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC), was an independent prognostic factor for progression-free survival in T"}
{"answers": "The frequency and topographic distribution of LNM are not modified by NACT, and clinical non-responders showed more involved LNs. A systemic and extensive lymphadenectomy should be performed in patients treated with NACT plus surgery regardless of the response to NACT.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in cervical cancer does not significantly modify the extent of lymphadenectomy. The incidence of lymph node metastasis was significantly decreased in the NACT-responsive group compared to the non-responsive group, but the metastatic rates for every lymph node group also declined in the NACT-responsive group except for the deep inguinal and the para-aortic lymph node groups. Therefore, the extent of lymphadenectomy may not be modified by NACT in cervical cancer."}
{"answers": "A prior benign prostate biopsy may be independently associated with more favorable surgical and biochemical outcomes after prostatectomy. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings.", "prediction_text": "Yes, prior benign prostate biopsy predicts better outcome for patients treated with radical perineal prostatectomy. Patients who had prior benign biopsies had more favorable pathologic features, including more organ-confined and less margin-positive disease, and lower probability of biochemical failure."}
{"answers": "This clinical trial evaluated the possible reduction in intervention-related myocardial damage that was attributable to remote postischemic conditioning.", "prediction_text": "Remote postischemic conditioning (RPIC) may have a protective effect against myocardial damage in patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for stable angina or non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome, with troponin levels <1 ng/ml at randomization. The study found that RPIC reduced the maximum increase in troponin levels in the first 24 hours after PCI in both the overall population and in diabetic patients. However, the study did not find a significant reduction in readmission due to heart failure or cardiovascular mortality after 1 year of follow-up."}
{"answers": "These results indicate that prophylactic treatment with edaravone prevents I/R-induced ovarian damage during pneumoperitoneum in an experimental rat model.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that edaravone offers protection against ischemia/reperfusion-induced ovarian damage in rats. The results show that administration of different doses of edaravone significantly prevented degenerative changes in the ovary and reduced caspase-3 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, biochemical measurements of oxidative stress markers revealed that prophylactic edaravone treatment attenuated oxidative stress induced by I/R injury."}
{"answers": "Sonography has no place in the diagnosis of undescended testis.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, ultrasonography is not accurate in detecting retractile testes, but it can detect 67% of palpable undescended testes. However, in cases where no palpable testis is present, ultrasonography may miss the abdominal testes and incorrectly identify other structures as a testis. Therefore, it is not recommended to perform ultrasonography in boys with undescended testis."}
{"answers": "Mammographic density is not associated with an increased need for re-excision or resection of unnecessary margins at initial BCS.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, mammographic density (MD) does not have a significant impact on the margin re-excision rate after breast-conserving surgery (BCS). The study found that the rate of unnecessary margins did not differ by breast density. However, the patients with denser breasts according to BI-RADS classification and volumetric density had a trend towards requiring more frequent re-excision in the bivariable analysis, but this association was not seen in the multivariable analysis. Additionally, the study found that the re-excision rates increased with DCIS and decreased with resection of additional margins in the multivariate analysis."}
{"answers": "Septal suturing after septoplasty offers the following advantages: elimination of discomfort for the patients, minimal complications, the outcome is almost the same as with nasal packing, and finally the hospital stay is less than with nasal packing. Therefore, suturing of the nasal septum after septoplasty should be a preferred alternative to nasal packing.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that suturing the nasal septum after septoplasty is not an effective alternative to nasal packing. The study found a higher incidence of complications, such as minor oozing, bleeding, septal hematoma, and postoperative adhesions, in the group that underwent suturing of the nasal septum. Additionally, the operating time was longer in this group. These findings suggest that nasal packing may be a safer and more effective method of managing the nasal septum after septoplasty."}
{"answers": "The present study does not support the recommendation of ultrasound as a conclusive diagnostic tool for internal derangements of the temporomandibular joint.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that ultrasound imaging may not be a reliable method for detecting internal derangements of the temporomandibular joint, as it has lower sensitivity compared to magnetic resonance imaging. Therefore, ultrasound may not have a place in the diagnostic workup of temporomandibular joint disorders."}
{"answers": "Our results showed that the serum leptin level has no prognostic indications in advanced lung cancer patients. Leptin is decreased in lung cancer, and there is lack of correlation with tumour\u2011related factors including prognosis. Therefore, leptin is not a useful clinical marker in lung cancer (Tab. 2, Fig. 2, Ref. 22).", "prediction_text": "No, there was no significant association between serum leptin levels and overall survival in advanced lung cancer patients."}
{"answers": "We found no evidence of serovar specific immunity in our population. It remains possible that populations with a higher prevalence of gonorrhoea and more frequent infections may have a quantitatively greater immune response.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found no evidence of serovar-specific immunity to Neisseria gonorrhoeae, as the prevalence of serovars isolated following a repeat infection was not significantly different from those without repeat infections."}
{"answers": "BPPV is associated with positive viral serology, particularly during certain months of the year, mainly in spring and autumn. Viral infection might promote BPPV attacks due to the development of vestibulopathy or induce secondary BPPV via viral infection-related neurolabyrinthitis.", "prediction_text": "Yes, viral infections are associated with an increased risk of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). The study found that all viral serology values were higher in the BPPV group than in the control group, with seasonal variations in the levels of certain viruses. These findings suggest that viral infections may play a role in the development of BPPV."}
{"answers": "We found increased post-ictal serum cytokine levels in patients with several epilepsy syndromes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that there is a significant increase in certain cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6) in the serum of patients with epilepsy compared to healthy controls. Additionally, there was a correlation between certain demographic factors and cytokine levels, such as male gender and positive family history. Furthermore, serial analysis during the seizure-free period revealed a decrease in cytokine levels in the patients. These findings suggest that cytokines may play a role in the pathophysiology of epilepsy."}
{"answers": "Neuromedin U reduces insulin and increases somatostatin secretion. Blockade of somatostatin action abolishes the inhibition of insulin secretion by NmU. The results of the study suggest that somatostatin mediates the inhibitory action of NmU on insulin secretion.", "prediction_text": "Yes, somatostatin confers insulinostatic effects of neuromedin U in the rat pancreas. The study found that somatostatin receptors in the pancreas are responsible for mediating the inhibitory effects of neuromedin U on insulin secretion, and that the effects are dose-dependent."}
{"answers": "Patients with fewer or anterior sutures have shorter OR times. However, 30-day readmission, band-related reoperation, and postoperative weight loss were unaffected by number or location of suture. The technical aspects of HHR did not appear to be associated with readmission or reoperation, and therefore a standardized approach may not be necessary.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the location and number of sutures used for hiatal hernia repair during laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) may have an impact on the rate of reoperation for band-related problems. Specifically, patients who had fewer sutures (on average 1 suture) had shorter operating room (OR) time, while those with posterior suture placement had a longer length of stay (LOS) in the hospital. There was no significant difference in other outcomes such as 30-day readmission, band-related reoperation, and postoperative BMI/%EWL."}
{"answers": "Survivors of lobar ICH with atrial fibrillation should not be offered long-term anticoagulation. Similarly, most patients with deep hemispheric ICH and atrial fibrillation should not receive anticoagulant therapy. However, patients with deep hemispheric ICH at particularly high risk for thromboembolic stroke or low risk of ICH recurrence might benefit from long-term anticoagulation.", "prediction_text": "The decision to anticoagulate patients with a history of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is complex and depends on various factors. Our analysis using a decision-analysis model suggests that for patients with prior lobar ICH, withholding anticoagulation therapy is the preferred option, as it leads to a gain of 1.9 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). However, for patients with prior deep hemispheric ICH, the gain is smaller, at 0.3 QALYs. Sensitivity analyses suggest that anticoagulation may be preferred in patients with high risk"}
{"answers": "This study showed that FDG is not a good surrogate tracer for tumor hypoxia under either ambient or hypoxic conditions. Only specific hypoxia tracers should be used to measure tumor hypoxia.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that (18)F-FDG is not a reliable surrogate tracer to measure tumor hypoxia, as there is a decreasing similarity between the (14)C-EF3 and FDG activity in the tumor tissue under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. The Dice similarity index (DSI) values obtained from the AR images were lower under hypoxic conditions than under normoxic conditions, indicating that (18)F-FDG is not a reliable indicator of tumor hypoxia."}
{"answers": "A task-specific intervention designed to improve gait speed may potentially provide secondary benefits by positively impacting depression, mobility and social participation for people post stroke.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there are secondary benefits of treadmill training for people in the chronic stage of recovery from stroke. Treadmill training resulted in significant improvements in depression, mobility, and social participation over time, with no significant differences found between the treadmill and control groups at any time point."}
{"answers": "Orthostatic myoclonus is often underdiagnosed and can be considered a possible cause of unsteadiness in subjects with neurodegenerative diseases. Electromyography surface recording is thereby an aid for investigating unsteadiness of unknown origin.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that orthostatic myoclonus (OM) is an underrecognized cause of unsteadiness in neurodegenerative diseases. The study found that OM was the most frequent disorder in patients with unexplained unsteadiness/gait impairment, and that the majority of patients with OM had an associated neurodegenerative disease. The study also found that leg jerking was only observed by visual inspection during orthostatism in some patients, and that four patients showed improvement of orthostatic myoclonus with antimyoclonic treatment."}
{"answers": "Severely injured patients treated at a level III center had a higher mortality rate than those treated at a level I center. Most problems identified occurred in the emergency department and were related to delays in care provision. This research highlights the importance of efficient prehospital, in-hospital, and regional trauma systems, performance monitoring, peer review, and adherence to protocols and guidelines.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that the level of trauma center providing treatment to severely injured adult trauma patients in an Australian health service makes a significant difference in mortality and hospital length of stay. Patients who presented to a level III trauma center had a higher risk of death compared to those who presented to a level I trauma center, after controlling for various factors such as age, sex, Injury Severity Score (ISS), and prehospital time. Additionally, peer review of deaths at the level III center identified problems in care delivery, including technical errors, delay in decision making, and errors of judgment."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that very few genes, which change their expression level during the WOI, show a quantitative homogeneous expression in endometrially-receptive patients. In conclusion, in this study only six genes showed a homogeneous expression, and are probably involved in embryo implantation mechanisms.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no uniform basal endometrial gene expression profile during the implantation window in women who became pregnant in a subsequent ICSI cycle. Only 6 out of 43 genes analyzed showed a statistically uniform expression among patients who subsequently became pregnant."}
{"answers": "While SSA would be the first region to experience the huge benefits of implementing the \"test and treat\" policy of the WHO, the region is not yet prepared to manage the consequential increased burden of ART-related toxic and metabolic complications. Urgent measures should be taken to fill the lacunae if SSA is not to become over-burdened by the consequences of the \"test and treat\" policy.", "prediction_text": "Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) may face significant challenges in coping with the increased incidence of antiretroviral therapy (ART) related adverse effects resulting from the new \"test and treat\" policy of the World Health Organization (WHO). The region is already grappling with poverty, weak health systems, inadequate health services, and a lack of qualified health personnel and equipment, which may hinder its ability to manage the expected increase in ART-related adverse effects. Additionally, there is a lack of data on the incidence and predictive factors of these adverse effects in SSA, which makes it difficult to anticipate and prepare an adequate response"}
{"answers": "In summary we believe sudden onset chest wall rigidity may be a significant and previously unreported factor leading to an increased mortality, from illicit IV fentanyl use. Fentanyl and norfentanyl ratios and concentrations suggest a more rapid onset of death given the finding of fentanyl without norfentanyl in many of the fatalities. Chest wall rigidity may help explain the cause of death in these instances, in contrast to the typical opioid-related overdose deaths. Intravenous heroin users should be educated regarding this potentially fatal complication given the increasingly common substitution and combination with heroin of fentanyl.", "prediction_text": "Yes, chest wall rigidity could be a factor in rapid death from illicit fentanyl abuse. The study found that in half of the cases, there was no measurable norfentanyl (the active metabolite of fentanyl) present, suggesting a very rapid onset of respiratory arrest. This is consistent with the idea that chest wall rigidity can occur rapidly after fentanyl exposure, leading to respiratory failure and death."}
{"answers": "There appears to be no benefit in metformin co-treatment before and during IVF in women with PCO without any other features of PCOS. Clinical Trials.gov: NCT01046032.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that short-term metformin co-treatment during IVF does not improve live birth rates or reduce severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) in women with ovaries of polycystic morphology without any other features of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)."}
{"answers": "The study suggests that ventilating an adult patient is possible with a smaller, pediatric-sized BVM. The tidal volumes recorded with the pediatric BVM were more consistent with lung-protective ventilation volumes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, EMS providers can provide appropriate tidal volumes in a simulated adult-sized patient with a pediatric-sized bag-valve-mask (BVM). The study found that the pediatric BVM provided lower median tidal volumes compared to the adult BVM in all three categories of airway devices, and a greater percentage of breaths delivered in the recommended range occurred when the pediatric BVM was used."}
{"answers": "Our results suggest that colonoscopy does not affect the management of patients with acute diverticulitis nor alter the outcome. The current practice of a routine colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis, diagnosed by typical clinical symptoms and CT needs to be reevaluated.", "prediction_text": "No, a colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis does not significantly affect its management."}
{"answers": "Pretreatment ECG is of limited value for patients with an unremarkable cardiovascular history and a normal heart rate and blood pressure. Hypotension may occur during treatment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, cardiovascular evaluation is necessary prior to and during beta-blocker therapy for infantile hemangiomas. Although the study found that ECG abnormalities were found in 6.5% of patients, there were no contraindications to beta-blocker therapy and no major complications. Additionally, 88 parents reported side effects during beta-blocker treatment, highlighting the importance of monitoring patients for potential cardiovascular side effects."}
{"answers": "Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is a promising option for lifelong treatment of type 2 diabetes. It has the potential to improve or cure a selected spectrum of type 1 diabetes when performed early in the disease. Further animal model studies or randomized controlled trials are needed to support our conclusion.", "prediction_text": "The current evidence suggests that Roux-en-Y gastric bypass can provide a lifelong solution for diabetes mellitus in obese patients with type 2 diabetes. The article highlights the success of gastric bypass surgery in improving glucose control and reducing insulin requirements in these patients, with some studies showing complete resolution of diabetes in up to 70% of patients. However, it is important to note that the long-term durability of the response and the potential for recurrence of diabetes after surgery are still being studied and debated. Further research is needed to determine the optimal candidates for surgery and to improve the predictability"}
{"answers": "Collectively, results suggest that behavioral adaptation to ESC is likely in certain drivers; however, its proven effectiveness in reducing the likelihood of being involved in a serious crash probably outweighs any potential increases in unsafe driving. To fully benefit from ESC, vehicle manufacturers are encouraged to market ESC-equipped vehicles in a realistic, safe manner. Driver training and safety organizations are also encouraged to provide balanced educational information about ESC to their members.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that the widespread introduction of ESC into the Canadian vehicle fleet may lead to behavioral adaptation by drivers, which could offset or reduce the overall effectiveness of ESC. While drivers who are aware of ESC are more likely to perceive it as safer and be confident in its ability to work in an emergency, some drivers may adapt their driving behavior in response to the presence of ESC, such as becoming less vigilant or relying too heavily on the technology."}
{"answers": "The results of the study demonstrate that when clinical supervision uses best practice principles, it can provide professional support for allied health workers, even during times of rapid organisational change.", "prediction_text": "The study found that longer and more frequent supervision sessions, as well as a longer total duration of supervision, were significantly positively correlated with higher levels of clinical supervision effectiveness. Additionally, having a say in the allocation of a supervisor, having a completed supervision agreement, and receiving clinical supervision were also associated with higher levels of effectiveness. These findings suggest that clinical supervision can be an effective mechanism for supporting and developing the skills of allied health professionals, and that certain components of supervision (such as duration, frequency, and autonomy in the allocation of supervisors) are important for its effectiveness. However, the study did not specifically address the sustainability of clinical"}
{"answers": "Both 'economic/employment' and 'social/welfare' dimensions of social exclusion significantly influence suicide mortality among males. The influence of 'economic/employment' and 'social/welfare' dimensions of social exclusion on female suicide mortality is controversial. Social exclusion might be considered as a risk factor for suicide mortality in Europe.", "prediction_text": "Yes, some aspects of social exclusion, specifically the \"economic/employment\" and \"social/welfare\" dimensions, are significantly associated with suicide mortality in both males and females in Europe. The relationship between these dimensions and suicide mortality is negative, indicating that higher levels of social exclusion are associated with higher suicide mortality rates. However, the influence of the \"social/welfare\" dimension is stronger among females compared to the \"economic/employment\" dimension. Additionally, GDP has a positive influence on suicide mortality in both models."}
{"answers": "While ultrasound examination is inexpensive and easily done, it is not accurate enough for staging small penile cancers located at the glans penis. However, for larger tumors ultrasound can be a useful addition to physical examination by delineating reliably the anatomic relations of the tumor to structures such as the tunica albuginea, corpus cavernosum, and urethra.", "prediction_text": "Yes, ultrasound examination is a useful addition to the clinical staging of squamous cell carcinoma of the penis. It can help assess the extent and invasion of the tumor into the corpora cavernosa and tunica albuginea, and provide accurate measurement of the maximum tumor thickness."}
{"answers": "This study confirms that a large percentage of patients use metered-dose inhalers improperly. It also demonstrates a significant lack of understanding by health care providers of the proper use of metered-dose inhalers. Furthermore, this study supports the use of respiratory care practitioners in the outpatient setting, since they were the most proficient among all the health care providers in the proper use of metered-dose inhalers.", "prediction_text": "Health care providers, including house staff, nurses, and respiratory care practitioners, have varying levels of proficiency in the proper use of metered-dose inhalers. While respiratory care practitioners were the most knowledgeable, a significant percentage of health care providers, including patients, had a poor understanding of the technique used with metered-dose inhalers."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrated that the regional or global apex of a given curve is the most rotated level in only a minority of the curves. The most rotated level may be as far as two levels from the global apex and one level from the regional apex.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, the transverse apex (most rotated vertebral level) does not always coincide with the coronal apex levels (regional or global) in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. The study found that the regional and global apex levels were at the same level in 54.5% of curves, within half a level in 45.4%, and one level higher in 2% of curves. There was a higher variability in the difference between the most rotated levels and the regional and global apex levels, extending up to two levels for the global apex."}
{"answers": "Generalization of the RCT sample was supported, because only 7.8% of Phenomenology subjects did not fit the RCT criteria. Nevertheless, because the RCT subjects were more severely ill, it is unclear if treatment findings from the RCT will be applicable to children with less severe mania.", "prediction_text": "The \"Treatment of Early Age Mania (TEAM)\" sample does not generalize well to the diagnostic characteristics of child bipolar I disorder. The TEAM sample had a higher prevalence of mania symptoms, ultradian rapid cycling, psychosis, and suicidality compared to a sample obtained through consecutive new case ascertainment (Phenomenology study). This suggests that the TEAM sample may be biased towards more severe or complex cases of child bipolar I disorder."}
{"answers": "Experts across Europe asserted the right to culturally sensitive health care for all immigrants. There is a broad consensus among experts about the major principles of good practice that need to be implemented across Europe. However, there also is some disagreement both within and between countries on specific issues that require further research and debate.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a broad consensus among country experts in Europe on the principles of good practice for health care for immigrants, despite some discordance within and between countries. The study identified 9 themes that were considered most important by experts in all 16 participating countries, including easy and equal access to health care, empowerment of migrants, culturally sensitive health care services, and quality of care. However, there were also some differences in the prioritization of factors within and between countries, highlighting the need for further discussion and consensus-building among stakeholders."}
{"answers": "Biochemical analysis of injured cervical intervertebral disks reveals the presence of inflammatory markers such as MCP, fragments of structural matrix proteins such as FAC, and a correlation with pH. Further evaluation of the FAC as a potential diagnostic biomarker or therapeutic target is warranted in the cervical spine.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the fibronectin-aggrecan complex (FAC) was present in the lavage fluid of patients with cervical disk disease. The study found a statistically significant correlation between the FAC and the cytokine MCP, as well as between the FAC and the pH of the lavage fluid. These findings suggest that the FAC may play a role in the inflammatory response in cervical disk disease."}
{"answers": "Affect-regulated exercise to feel 'good' can be used in a training programme to regulate exercise intensity. This approach led to a 19% increase in time to reach ventilatory threshold, which is indicative of improved fitness.", "prediction_text": "Yes, training at an intensity that feels \"good\" through affect-regulated exercise leads to improved fitness, specifically an increase in time to reach ventilatory threshold, over an 8-week training program."}
{"answers": "In Southern Italy, hepatitis G virus infection is widespread among patients with chronic hepatitis, independently of parenteral risk factors. Its frequency in subjects with cryptogenic liver disease parallels that observed in hepatitis C virus chronic liver disease, thus ruling out an aetiologic role of hepatitis G virus. TT virus infection is uncommon in patients with cryptogenic or hepatitis C virus-related liver disease who do not have a history of parenteral exposure.", "prediction_text": "The study found that hepatitis G virus infection was not significantly more common in patients with cryptogenic chronic liver disease compared to those with hepatitis C virus-related chronic liver disease. However, the presence of at least one marker of hepatitis G virus infection (hepatitis G virus-RNA and/or anti-hepatitis G virus) was comparable between the two groups. Additionally, TT virus-DNA was detected in serum of 3 subjects, including 1 with cryptogenic and 2 with hepatitis C virus-related chronic liver disease. Overall, the study suggests that hepatitis G virus and TT virus may play a"}
{"answers": "Our findings suggest that somatic complaints may represent one, but not necessarily the most important, risk factor for the subsequent development of depressive symptoms in women in nonclinical populations. The results also highlight the importance of including social variables in studies on women's depression as well as conducting additional research to further examine predictors of depressive symptoms in men.", "prediction_text": "Yes, somatic complaints predicted subsequent symptoms of depression in women, but not in men. Baseline scores on the SCL-90-R somatization subscale significantly predicted subsequent self-reported symptoms of depressed mood 5 years later in women, but not in men."}
{"answers": "Peak inspiratory pressure, PEEP, and ventilation index values could distinguish survivors from nonsurvivors by day 3. This may assist in early application of supportive nonconventional therapies in children with malignancy and ARDS.", "prediction_text": "Yes, early respiratory predictors such as peak inspiratory pressure, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and ventilation index can predict the outcome of children with hemato-oncology malignancy who develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). These predictors can distinguish between survivors and non-survivors by day 3 after the onset of mechanical ventilation, and a significant relationship between respiratory data and outcome related to efficiency of oxygenation is present from day 8."}
{"answers": "In this small study serum inhibin concentrations higher than those found in the early follicular phase one to two weeks after evacuation of a hydatidiform mole seemed to be specific for persistent trophoblastic disease. Further data are needed to confirm these promising results.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that inhibin may be a useful new marker for the diagnosis and monitoring of hydatidiform mole. The concentrations of inhibin in serum and tissue were found to be significantly higher in patients with hydatidiform mole compared to normal pregnant women, and the levels decreased significantly after evacuation of the mole. Additionally, none of the patients whose serum inhibin concentrations were 0.4 U/ml or less after evacuation developed persistent trophoblastic disease. These findings suggest that inhibin may be a useful marker for the early detection and monitoring of hydatidiform mole."}
{"answers": "The integration of whole-lesion dynamic data tends to improve specificity. However, no statistical significance backs up this finding.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that while whole lesion time curve distribution analysis may not be necessary for diagnostic accuracy in MR-mammography, it can provide additional information that may be useful in certain cases. The most suspect curve and combined dynamic data had higher diagnostic accuracy than the curve-type distribution percentage, but the differences did not reach statistical significance. Therefore, while the results suggest that whole lesion time curve distribution analysis may not be essential, it can be a useful tool in certain cases."}
{"answers": "The seemingly exaggerated traditional fear of anaphylaxis seems to discourage surgeons from more widely adopting minimal access techniques for the treatment of hydatid cyst.", "prediction_text": "Yes, fear of anaphylactic shock is a significant factor discouraging surgeons from widely adopting percutaneous and laparoscopic techniques in the treatment of liver hydatid cysts."}
{"answers": "Grandmultiparous women had increased maternal and neonatal morbidity, and neonatal mortality even after controlling for confounders, suggesting a need for closer observation than regular multiparous patients during labor and delivery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, grandmultiparity is an independent risk factor for several adverse perinatal outcomes, including abruptio placentae, preterm delivery, fetal macrosomia, neonatal death, postpartum hemorrhage, and blood transfusion."}
{"answers": "No single data source is likely to provide a complete health profile for an individual. For women with depression in pregnancy and dispensed antidepressants, the hospital admission data do not adequately capture all cases.", "prediction_text": "The study found that only 13.6% of pregnant women who were dispensed antidepressants had depression recorded as a comorbidity on their hospital records, indicating that many women with major depression in pregnancy may not be identifiable in population health data using administrative records alone. Additionally, the study found that only 80% of women who were dispensed antidepressants had depression recorded as a comorbidity on their hospital records, suggesting that there may be under-ascertainment of depression in administrative data. Overall, the study suggests that data linkage methods may be useful for identifying women with major depression in pregnancy, but that there are limitations"}
{"answers": "These data suggest a pattern of diagnostic stability over time for manic and mixed episodes in patients with bipolar disorder. Careful prospective studies of this issue are needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that the distribution of manic and mixed episodes in patients with bipolar disorder runs true over time, with a significantly higher proportion of patients experiencing consistent patterns of manic or mixed episodes compared to what would be expected by chance."}
{"answers": "The analyses show that structural characteristics of a practice are not associated with uptake of a new IT facility, but that its use may be influenced by post-graduate education in the relevant clinical condition. For this diabetes system at least, practice nurse use was critical in spreading uptake beyond initial GP enthusiasts and for sustained and rising use in subsequent years.", "prediction_text": "Yes, general practice characteristics are associated with uptake of an IT innovation in primary care. Specifically, the number of diabetes-educated staff in a practice is positively associated with the use of a web-based clinical information system."}
{"answers": "GAPS, a simple clinical score, is a better predictor of admission than triage nurses, unless the nurse is sure about the outcome, in which case their clinical judgement should be respected.", "prediction_text": "In this study, GAPS significantly outperformed nurses' visual analogue scale (VAS) in predicting admission at triage. GAPS accurately predicted admission in the majority of attendances (80.6%), while VAS overestimated admission by 6.6% (p<0.0001). When clinical certainty was high (\u226595%), GAPS significantly outperformed both methods, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.891 and accuracy of 82.5%. These findings suggest that GAPS is a more reliable and accurate tool than nurses'"}
{"answers": "Our data showed no difference in 25(OH) D levels between normal children and those with CD when adjusted for body mass index.", "prediction_text": "No, vitamin D deficiency is not a feature of pediatric celiac disease in prepubertal children. The study found that the vitamin D levels of children with celiac disease were not significantly different from those of non-celiac children. However, there was a trend towards higher vitamin D levels in non-obese celiac children compared to non-obese normal children."}
{"answers": "Granulomatous myelotoxicity and enteritis developed in a 21 year old female within 3 weeks of initiating sulfasalazine for rheumatoid arthritis. Following a short course of corticosteroids, the patient had resolution of her cholestatic hepatitis, rash, eosinophilia, and gastrointestinal symptoms with no residual manifestations at 7 months follow-up. Although severe reactions to sulfasalazine are rare and unpredictable, practicing physicians should be aware of unusual clinical presentations of toxicity when prescribing sulfasalazine.", "prediction_text": "No, the patient in the paper does not have Crohn's disease. The patient is described as having granulomatous enteritis, which is a characteristic feature of sarcoidosis, not Crohn's disease."}
{"answers": "Healthy lifestyles lead to an increase in the utilization of preventive health services. However, there is not much significantly reducing the number of outpatient visits in people with health behaviors. Specifically, people with regular exercise habits and who take their blood pressure measurement regularly have an increased number of outpatient visits. It is suggested that more available and accessible health consultation services be provided to inculcate in the general public the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle.", "prediction_text": "Yes, this study found that individuals with better health behaviors (e.g., exercise habits, dietary habits, regular blood pressure measurement, and drinking habits) had lower utilization of healthcare resources, as measured by the number of outpatient visits and health examinations."}
{"answers": "Parental restriction of R-rated movie viewing is associated with both lower adolescent smoking susceptibility and lower smoking rates.", "prediction_text": "Yes, parental restriction of R-rated movie viewing is associated with lower adolescent smoking susceptibility. The study found that adolescents who had partial or no restriction on R-rated movie viewing were more likely to be susceptible to smoking compared to those with full restriction, after controlling for demographic factors and family and friend smoking."}
{"answers": "Having a usual physician can be an effective tool in improving access to care for low-income populations, although it is most effective when combined with insurance coverage. However, the effectiveness of managed care in linking more low-income persons to a medical home is uncertain, and may have unintended consequences for uninsured persons.", "prediction_text": "No, managed care does not enable more low-income persons to identify a usual source of care. In fact, the study found that high managed care penetration in the community is associated with a lower likelihood of having a usual source of care for uninsured persons."}
{"answers": "Locally 1.0% ropivacaine administration significantly relieves the pain of pediatric tonsillectomy and, it is a safe and effective method. High concentrations of ropivaciane may produce clinically significant pain relief. It is more effective to reduce of post-operative analgesic requirement after first hour.", "prediction_text": "Yes, topical ropivacaine hydrochloride reduces post-tonsillectomy morbidity in pediatric patients, specifically in terms of pain control, with a statistically significant difference observed in the first hour after surgery, and thereafter."}
{"answers": "Minimally invasive mitral valve repair using neochords provided a high rate of repair, reproducible results in a routine cardiac surgery setting and stable repair during follow-up. This has become our preferred technique for mitral valve surgery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, minimally invasive mitral valve repair with artificial chords is reproducible and applicable in routine surgery. The study found that the use of neochords in video-assisted mitral valve repair resulted in a high repair rate, low regurgitation rate, and low complication rate. The study included 426 patients who underwent minimally invasive mitral valve repair from 2008 to 2013, and the results suggest that this approach is a viable and effective treatment option for mitral valve disease."}
{"answers": "Comparisons of absolute EOA values grouped by the manufacturers' valve sizes are misleading because of specific differences in geometric dimensions. The EOA:patient aortic annulus area ratio provides a new hemodynamic index which may facilitate objective comparisons between different valve types.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the effective orifice area (EOA) / patient aortic annulus area ratio is a better way to compare different bioprostheses, as it takes into account the individual patient's anatomy and the dimensions of the valve, rather than just the labeled size of the prosthesis. This ratio provides a more accurate measure of the prosthesis's performance in the patient's specific anatomy."}
{"answers": "Women compared to men often delay seeking treatment for an AMI, which further increases their risks. Our findings suggest specific characteristics that can serve as a profile to those African Americans most likely to delay seeking treatment for AMI.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that women were more likely than men to delay seeking medical help for symptoms of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) due to several reasons, including:"}
{"answers": "A reduced alveolar macrophage phagocytic host response to apoptotic cells or NTHi may contribute to neutrophilic inflammation and NTHi colonization in both PBB and bronchiectasis. Whether this mechanism also contributes to the progression of PBB to bronchiectasis remains unknown.", "prediction_text": "Yes, alveolar macrophage phagocytic dysfunction is a forerunner to bronchiectasis in children with protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB). The study found that children with PBB or bronchiectasis had significantly lower macrophage phagocytic capacity compared to control subjects, and this reduction was associated with reduced expression of phagocytic scavenger receptors and increased inflammation in the airways. These findings suggest that impaired macrophage function may be an early event in the development of bronchiectasis."}
{"answers": "Cervical physical therapy can have a positive effect on subjective tinnitus complaints in patients with a combination of tinnitus and neck complaints. Larger studies, using more responsive outcome measures, are however necessary to prove this effect.", "prediction_text": "Yes, multi-modal cervical physical therapy significantly improved tinnitus complaints in patients with cervicogenic somatic tinnitus (CST). Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) and Neck Bournemouth Questionnaire (NBQ) scores decreased significantly after treatment and remained lower after follow-up at 6 weeks. Immediately after treatment, 53% of patients experienced substantial improvement of tinnitus, and this effect was maintained in 24% of patients after follow-up."}
{"answers": "Because workers may have an elevated relative aerobic workload for several hours each working day, this relationship may elucidate a mechanism behind the increased risk for cardiovascular disease among workers exposed to high levels of occupational physical activity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found a positive relationship between aerobic workload and ambulatory blood pressure (ABP). Specifically, a 1% increase in mean relative aerobic workload was associated with an increase of 0.42 \u00b1 0.05 mmHg in systolic ABP and 0.30 \u00b1 0.04 mmHg in diastolic ABP. These findings suggest that high levels of occupational physical activity may contribute to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease among workers."}
{"answers": "Our investigation did not undoubtedly prove that significant changes of fetal biometric parameters occurred in the last three decades. It is possible that secular growth acceleration does not exist in prenatal period but also the observed time period could have been short for this phenomenon to manifest.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no statistically significant difference in fetal biometric parameters measured by ultrasound between the contemporary fetal population and those from 35 years ago, indicating that secular growth acceleration does not occur during fetal life."}
{"answers": "Consistent with prior studies, we found an inverse relationship between obesity and serum prostate specific antigen. However, the magnitude of the difference was small. Thus, adjusting prostate specific antigen for body mass index does not appear warranted.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that body mass index (BMI) is not significantly associated with prostate specific antigen (PSA) after adjusting for age. A 10-point increase in BMI was associated with a PSA difference of -0.03 ng/ml, which is not clinically significant. Therefore, PSA should not be adjusted for BMI."}
{"answers": "Emergency laparotomy carries a high rate of mortality, especially in those over the age of 70 years, and more needs to be done to improve outcomes, particularly in this group. This could involve increasing acute surgical care manpower, early recognition of patients requiring emergency surgery, development of clear management protocols for such patients or perhaps even considering centralisation of emergency surgical services to specialist centres with multidisciplinary teams involving emergency surgeons and care of the elderly physicians in hospital and related community outreach services for post-discharge care.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that the 30-day and 1-year mortality rates after emergency laparotomy were significantly higher than expected, with a 12.4% 30-day mortality rate in patients aged <70 years and a 22% mortality rate in those aged >70 years. The 1-year mortality rate was 25.15% in patients aged <70 years and 38% in those aged >70 years. These findings suggest that there is a need for improvement in the care and management of patients undergoing emergency laparotomy to reduce mortality rates."}
{"answers": "[corrected] This observation is exceptional in many aspects: very early age of onset of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, no immune deficit, association with a rare congenital neurological syndrome. We discuss the possible link between this entity and the occurrence of tuberculosis.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a possible causal link between the Say-Barber-Miller syndrome and the occurrence of cerebromediastinal tuberculosis in the child described in the medical paper."}
{"answers": "The signal intensity on DWI showed no significant difference in the development of vascularization.", "prediction_text": "No, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is not a significant indicator of the development of vascularization in hypovascular hepatocellular lesions (HHLs). The study found that the 730-day cumulative development of vascularization in hypointense, isointense, and hyperintense lesions was not significantly different."}
{"answers": "General practitioners should consider using patients' first names more often, particularly with younger patients.", "prediction_text": "According to the survey, the majority of patients (223) liked being called by their first names by general practitioners, while only 77 disliked it. However, the majority of patients (324) did not want to call the doctor by their first name. Therefore, the answer to the question is no, general practitioners should not call patients by their first names."}
{"answers": "Patients after ART treatment suffer from higher C-section rates during their stage of delivery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that patients who underwent Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) had higher rates of cesarean sections (C-sections) compared to those who conceived spontaneously. Specifically, the groups of fresh transferred embryos and slow freezing had higher risks of both elective and emergency C-sections. Additionally, all groups of ART had an increased risk of significant perinatal bleeding."}
{"answers": "Trauma patients have a significant complication rate related to anticoagulation therapy, and predicting which patients will develop a complication remains unclear. Prospective studies are needed to determine which treatment regimen, if any, is appropriate to safely anticoagulate this high risk population.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the use of therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients is associated with a significant risk of complications, including bleeding and hemorrhage. The incidence of complications was found to be 21% in the study population. The patient factors that were found to be associated with an increased risk of complications include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, use of unfractionated heparin (UH) instead of fractionated heparin (FH), and lower initial platelet count. These findings suggest that therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients is not entirely safe and that careful monitoring and management of these patients is necessary to minim"}
{"answers": "A significant difference in dental health between recruits to each Service does exist and is a likely to be a reflection of the sociodemographic background from which they are drawn.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant differential in dental health between new recruits to the British Armed Forces, with the Army having the highest prevalence of dental decay and greatest treatment resource need compared to the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force."}
{"answers": "In light of the large sample size and prior pilot testing of presented images, results suggest that episodic migraineurs do not differentially attend to headache-related facial stimuli. Given modest evidence of attentional biases among chronic headache samples, these findings suggest potential differences in attentional processing between chronic and episodic headache subforms.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no evidence to suggest that episodic migraineurs selectively attend to headache-related visual stimuli. The study found no differences in attentional bias indices between migraine and non-migraine groups for both headache and happy facial stimuli."}
{"answers": "Under the conditions of this study, preclerkship (year 2) CPEs strongly predicted medical students at risk for failing a senior CPE. This finding opens the opportunity for remediation of deficits prior to or during clerkships.", "prediction_text": "Yes, students' scores on preclerkship clinical performance examinations can predict that they will fail a senior clinical performance examination. The study found that students who performed poorly on their second-year clinical performance examinations were at a higher risk of failing the senior clinical performance examination."}
{"answers": "Our results suggest that people do not attach a simple fixed premium to \"safety-related\" interventions but that preferences depend more subtly on context. The use of the results of such public preference surveys to directly inform policy would therefore be premature.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the public values interventions that prevent hospital-acquired infections more highly than interventions related to genetic disorders, and gives less weight to interventions related to lifestyle and sports injuries. This suggests that the public places a higher value on safety-related health care improvements when the health care system is responsible for the harm, rather than when the harm is caused by individual actions or natural events."}
{"answers": "Minimising the radiation dose to one of the parotid glands with the help of IMRT in patients with advanced head and neck cancers can prevent xerostomia in most patients and parotid scintigraphy is a useful method of documenting xerostomia.", "prediction_text": "The study found that dose reduction to one parotid gland does not prevent xerostomia in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancers undergoing intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with or without chemotherapy. In fact, the study found that only 2 out of 19 patients had grade III xerostomia, despite the parotid gland being spared on one side in most of the patients. The study suggests that other factors, such as the total dose received by the parotid gland and the timing of radiation therapy, may be more important in predicting xerostomia than the unilateral sparing of the parotid"}
{"answers": "It is important to continue FA supplementation over the long term in patients on methotrexate and FA in order to prevent them discontinuing treatment because of mouth ulcers or nausea and vomiting. Our data suggest that FA supplementation is also helpful in preventing neutropenia, with very little loss of efficacy of methotrexate.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that stopping folic acid supplementation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) established on methotrexate and folic acid may result in increased toxicity, as evidenced by an increased incidence of nausea in the placebo group. However, the study did not provide conclusive evidence that folic acid supplementation decreases the toxicity of methotrexate or improves its efficacy. Therefore, the long-term need for folic acid supplementation in these patients remains uncertain."}
{"answers": "LF and cruroplasty is feasible and has good results in terms of GERD symptoms control and additional weight loss. The high rate of postoperative complications observed in this series remains a matter of concern. A re-sleeve procedure might be considered as an alternative to RYGB/DS conversion restricted to selected patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, laparoscopic fundectomy (LF) is safe and effective as revision surgery for patients who have residual fundus or neofundus after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and continue to experience severe gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms. The study found that LF resulted in significant improvements in GERD symptoms and weight loss in both groups, with Group B experiencing an additional percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) of 53.4% at 24 months compared to Group A. However, there were some postoperative complications, including bleeding, mid-g"}
{"answers": "VAT area measurement at a single level 3 cm above the lower margin of the L3 vertebra is feasible and can reflect changes in VAT volume and body weight. Advances in knowledge: As VAT area at a CT slice 3cm above the lower margin of L3 can best reflect interval changes in VAT volume and body weight, VAT area measurement should be selected at this location.", "prediction_text": "Yes, visceral adipose tissue area measurement at a single level (specifically, 3 cm above the lower margin of L3) can represent visceral adipose tissue volume changes. The study found the strongest correlation between VAT area and VAT volume changes at this slice location."}
{"answers": "Barrett's cytokeratin 7/20 pattern can be a useful marker for the diagnosis of short-segment Barrett's oesophagus, although the false positive or false negative rate is approximately 25%.", "prediction_text": "Yes, cytokeratin immunoreactivity is useful in the diagnosis of short-segment Barrett's oesophagus in Korea. The study found that Barrett's cytokeratin 7/20 pattern was observed in 77.8% of cases with short-segment Barrett's oesophagus, and the sensitivity and specificity of this pattern were 77.8% and 77.5%, respectively."}
{"answers": "In this paper the effect of lunar phases on the time of delivery is shown. This influence seems to be especially relevant in the case of multiparae and plurigravidae. Nevertheless, it is too weak to allow for prediction regarding the days with the highest frequency of deliveries.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found a significant correlation between the lunar position and the day of delivery, with a peak in deliveries occurring around the full moon in multiparae and plurigravidae."}
{"answers": "Financial incentives for smoking cessation in pregnancy are highly cost-effective, with an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life years of \u00a3482, which is well below recommended decision thresholds.", "prediction_text": "Financial incentives of up to \u00a3400 for smoking cessation during pregnancy are likely to be cost-effective, with an incremental cost per quitter of \u00a31127 and an incremental cost-utility ratio (ICER) of \u00a3482 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). However, the results are uncertain and may vary depending on relapse rates after birth. The expected value of perfect information is \u00a330 million, suggesting that additional research is potentially worthwhile."}
{"answers": "This data demonstrates the robust nature of the short stay ward. At these two very different institutions we have shown improved bed efficient and patient care in a cost-effective way. We have also reported on greater parental satisfaction and early return of the child with their family to the community.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the short stay or 23-hour ward in a general and academic children's hospital is effective in increasing hospital efficiency and reducing costs. The study found that the short stay ward accounted for a significant proportion of admissions (10.3% and 14.7% at Westmead Hospital and the New Children's Hospital, respectively), with similar admission patterns to the main hospital. The average length of stay in the short stay ward was significantly shorter than in the main hospital, and the rate of patient admission to an in-hospital bed was low. Additionally, there were no adverse events reported, and parental satisfaction was high. The reallocation of resources to the short"}
{"answers": "Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery is a safe method of treatment in patients with Cushing's disease. Operative findings, radiological and histological findings, together with early postoperative serum cortisol and urine free cortisol estimates may identify failures in treatment. Alternative treatment might then be required for these patients. Because of the risk of late relapse, patients require life-long follow-up.", "prediction_text": "Yes, several factors can predict the outcome of transsphenoidal pituitary surgery in patients with Cushing's disease. These include:"}
{"answers": "Patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms have a great diversity of functional somatic symptoms. They use more somatic and psychotropic drugs than controls in the years before diagnosis. Moreover, they show high rates of referrals and psychiatric morbidity. The diversity of symptoms of patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms supports the concept that symptoms do not cluster in well defined distinct syndromes. Therefore, patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms should preferably not be classified into medical subspecialty syndromes.", "prediction_text": "No, the study suggests that chronic functional somatic symptoms are not a single syndrome, but rather a complex phenomenon that can involve multiple somatic systems and have different underlying causes. The study found that patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms had more comorbidity, used more medication, and had more psychiatric morbidity than controls, and were more likely to be referred to mental health workers and somatic specialists. Additionally, the study found that the number of patients undergoing diagnostic tests was higher for patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms than for controls, but hospital admissions rates were equal. These findings suggest that chronic functional somatic symptoms are a heterogeneous group of"}
{"answers": "The vast majority of MDT decisions are implemented. Management alteration was most often due to patient choice or additional information available after the MDT. A minority of management alterations were 'unjustifiable' and the authors recommend that any patient whose treatment is subsequently changed should have MDT rediscussion prior to treatment.", "prediction_text": "In this study, 91.5% of multidisciplinary team decisions for breast cancer management were found to be concordant with subsequent patient management, while 4.5% were discordant and 4% had no MDT decision. Of the discordant decisions, 17.8% were considered \"unjustifiable\" as there was no additional information available after the MDT to account for the change in management, while the remaining 82.2% were considered \"justifiable\" due to patient choice, additional information available after the MDT, or MDT error."}
{"answers": "We found that 1.6% of S. aureus (all MSSA) from bacteraemic patients were PVL-positive. This low incidence suggests that PVL-positive S. aureus are of no particular significance as causative agents of S. aureus bacteraemia.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL) is not associated with the pathogenesis of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia in the UK. Of the 244 S. aureus isolates from bacteraemic patients, only four (1.6%) were PVL-positive, and none of these isolates were oxacillin-resistant (methicillin-resistant S. aureus). In contrast, 36% of the isolates were oxacillin-resistant. These findings suggest that PVL may not play a significant role in the pathogen"}
{"answers": "These findings are in accordance with previous experimental work and provide additional support for the assertion that dogs can prime autistic children for therapy. Ultimately, this study may contribute toward a change for full acceptance of canine-assisted therapy programs within the medical milieu. Additional studies using a similar research protocol on more autistic children will certainly help professionals to work on the most effective methods to individually serve this population through canine-assisted interventions.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that dogs can prime autistic children for therapy. The participant exhibited more frequent and longer durations of positive behaviors, such as smiling and positive physical contacting, and less frequent and shorter durations of negative behaviors, such as aggressive manifestations, when exposed to the treatment condition involving a certified therapy dog. This suggests that the presence of a dog can positively modulate the behavior of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)."}
{"answers": "We conclude that increased cardiovascular risk of the DD genotype is not mediated through insulin resistance or abnormalities in fibrinolysis. Conversely, we report an increased sensitivity in NIDDM subjects with the ACE DD genotype.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the insertion allele (I) of the ACE gene I/D polymorphism is associated with insulin resistance in non-insulin-dependent diabetic (NIDDM) subjects."}
{"answers": "A history of PIPE may be a risk factor for the development of IPE. Yet, the disappearance of significance on multivariate analysis indicates that it is not an independent predictor.", "prediction_text": "Yes, postictal psychotic episodes (PIPE) are predictive of the development of interictal psychotic episodes (IPE) in patients with a partial seizure disorder. In this study, patients with a history of PIPE were more likely to develop IPE compared to those without PIPE. Additionally, male gender and the presence of bilateral ictal foci were also predictive of IPE in univariate analysis, but these variables lost significance in multivariate analysis."}
{"answers": "QTcD is significantly increased in hypertensive patients with LVH compared with those without, being strongly correlated with the indices of LVH. A QTcD cut-off value of 60 ms predicted LVH in hypertensive patients with a high sensitivity and specificity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, corrected QT dispersion (QTcD) can predict left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in hypertensive patients. The study found that hypertensive patients had significantly greater indices of LVH and QTcD compared to normotensive controls, and that QTcD was able to predict LVH with a high sensitivity and specificity in hypertensive patients."}
{"answers": "The shaving of the incision site immediately before spinal surgery may increase the rate of postoperative infection.", "prediction_text": "Yes, shaving the incision site before spinal surgery increases the postsurgical infection rate."}
{"answers": "The majority of EMS professionals thought that they should participate in disease and injury prevention programs. The respondents were mixed as to whether prevention services should be provided while on emergency calls, but those with experience providing these services were more likely to agree with providing them during emergency calls.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, 82.7% of emergency medical services (EMS) professionals surveyed believed that EMS professionals should participate in disease prevention programs. This suggests that the majority of EMS professionals are in favor of participating in disease prevention efforts."}
{"answers": "Current K/DOQI guidelines are inadequate for correcting VDDI or secondary hyperparathyroidism in CKD patients. Future studies should examine the effects of higher or more frequent dosing of ergocalciferol on these clinical endpoints.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the current K/DOQI treatment guidelines for vitamin D deficiency in CKD patients may not be adequate, as only 25% of patients achieved a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of >30 ng/ml (75 nmol/l) after treatment with ergocalciferol. Additionally, only 26% of patients had a >30% decrease in their intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) level after treatment. These findings suggest that more aggressive treatment may be needed to adequately manage vitamin D deficiency in CKD patients."}
{"answers": "Baseline pain intensity does not predict the outcome after an appropriate opioid titration. It is likely that non-homogeneous pain treatment would have biased the outcome of a previous work.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no correlation found between baseline pain intensity categories and opioid response in cancer patients."}
{"answers": "Maintaining viral load suppression over time in resource-limited-settings is feasible.", "prediction_text": "In this study conducted in a resource-limited setting, it was found that maintaining HIV viral load suppression over time is feasible, with 87.3% of patients achieving undetectable VL and only 16.5% experiencing virologic failure. However, the study also found that patients on third-line ART regimens had a higher number of virologic failures compared to those on first- or second-line regimens. These findings suggest that TasP strategies can be effective in resource-limited settings, but the risk of virologic failure and the need for third-line therapies should be taken into account when designing treatment as prevent"}
{"answers": "Mucosal redundancy is a constant associated finding in IHPS. Although the origin of the redundancy and a cause-and-effect relationship are difficult to establish, our findings support the hypothesis that hypergastrinemia may be implicated in the pathogenesis of IHPS, and suggest that mucosal thickening could be implicated as one of the initiating factors in its development.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is an etiologic role of pyloric mucosal hypertrophy in the development of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS) in infants. The study found that the pyloric mucosa is significantly thicker in infants with HPS compared to controls, and this hypertrophy may play a role in the development of the stenosis."}
{"answers": "Given the available screening technologies, discordant TEOAE and AABR may be inevitable for some categories of hearing loss among apparently healthy newborns whose mothers received prenatal care. The potential limitations of perinatal morbidities as basis of targeted screening for such cases therefore merit further consideration.", "prediction_text": "Yes, discordance in TEOAE and AABR outcomes can be predicted in newborns. Maternal and infant factors such as antenatal care attendance, mode of delivery, and nursery type were found to be significant predictors of discordant outcomes among all infants undergoing screening."}
{"answers": "GM of CRC and SLM was associated with fewer procedures but did not influence overall survival. SM was associated with a longer delay and increased use of chemotherapy between procedures, suggesting that more rigorous selection of SM patients for surgery may explain the higher disease-free survival after SLM resection.", "prediction_text": "Global management of colorectal cancer with synchronous liver metastases (SLM) at the same centre as the colorectal surgery may improve outcomes compared to separate management at different centers. The study found that patients who received global management had lower mean number of procedures (CRC+SLM), lower 3-month mortality, and higher 3-year and 5-year overall survival rates compared to those who received separate management. However, the difference in disease-free survival at 5 years was not statistically significant."}
{"answers": "epiDWI has the potential to differentiate pleomorphic adenoma and myoepithelial adenomas from all other examined entities. Due to an overlap not only within the group of benign and malignant lesions but also between groups, diagnoses should not be addressed on the basis of ADC values solely. Therefore, further studies combining DWI, morphologic criteria, and probably other MR imaging techniques seem warranted.", "prediction_text": "Yes, epiDWI can predict different histologic subtypes of primary parotid gland tumors with a high degree of accuracy. The ADC values of pleomorphic adenomas were significantly higher than those of other entities, and ADC values of Warthin tumors were different from those of myoepithelial adenomas, lipomas, and salivary duct carcinomas."}
{"answers": "The survey shows significant dissatisfaction amongst consultant radiologists with the current service, confirms a low number of paediatric radiologists taking on this work, and suggests the potential to increase numbers of radiology child abuse experts by 27% if given improved training and support. Appropriate service and education strategies should be implemented.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, only 52% of radiologists in UK hospitals with a radiology department have a dedicated paediatric radiologist, and only 61% of departments have a named radiologist to report skeletal surveys. Additionally, 25% of departments have non-paediatric radiologists providing initial reports on skeletal surveys for physical abuse, and 15% do not have ready access to a paediatric radiology opinion. These findings suggest that UK radiologists are not entirely satisfied with the training and support received in suspected child abuse."}
{"answers": "The enhancement of serum TNFalpha and IL-6 levels in the patients with ERCP-induced pancreatitis reflects the inflammatory activity. Additionally, these cytokines together with IL-4 can be used in clinical laboratory monitoring of ERCP.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the changes in the serum levels of IL-2, IL-4, TNFalpha, and IL-6 in the patients with post-ERCP pancreatitis reflect the inflammatory activity in these patients. The lower levels of IL-4 at 24 hours after ERCP and the higher ratios of TNFalpha/IL-4 at 12 and 24 hours after ERCP in the complicated group suggest that there is a decrease in anti-inflammatory cytokines and an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines, which may contribute to the development of post-ERCP pancreatitis. Additionally, the increased levels of IL-6 in"}
{"answers": "During the 5 years, 24% of Africans with optimal BP developed hypertension. The surge in hypertension in Africa is largely explained by modifiable risk factors. Public health strategies should focus aggressively on lifestyle to prevent a catastrophic burden on the national health system.", "prediction_text": "Yes, behavioral risk factors such as smoking, waist circumference, and alcohol intake were found to be independently associated with the conversion from optimal blood pressure to hypertensive status in Black South Africans. The study found that individuals who became hypertensive had higher baseline levels of these risk factors compared to those who remained normotensive. Additionally, the study found that baseline levels of \u03b3-glutamyltransferase and waist circumference were predictive of the 5-year change in blood pressure. These findings suggest that behavioral risk factors play a significant role in the development of hypertension in this population."}
{"answers": "Our data have revealed a number of differences. Compared to the clinic sample, the Web-based sample had worse psychological symptom burden, younger average age, higher prevalence of employment, and a lower proportion on ART. For future research, we recommend that Web-based data collection should include the demographic variables that we note differed between samples. In addition, we recognize that each recruitment method may bring inherent sampling bias, with clinic populations differing by geographical location and reflecting those accessing regular medical care, and Web-based sampling recruiting those with greater Internet access and identifying survey materials through specific searches and contact with specific websites.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that the Web-based sample of gay men living with HIV reported higher levels of psychological symptoms compared to the clinic sample, after controlling for other factors such as age, employment status, and antiretroviral therapy use. The Web-based sample was also younger and more likely to be in paid employment, but had worse physical symptom burden compared to the clinic sample. In contrast, there was no significant association between the recruitment setting and physical symptom burden in the multivariable model."}
{"answers": "The majority of acetabular components in this cohort were stable despite the small contact surface achieved between the component and pelvic bone. Three of 10 migrated in excess of the limits that predict later loosening in primary THA but it remains to be seen whether these limits apply to this selected group of frail osteoporotic patients. We continue to use this technique routinely to treat patients with the same indications, but since the analysis of these data we have added screw fixation of the acetabular component to the ischial tuberosity and the superior pubic ramus.", "prediction_text": "The study found that cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups does not provide initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures. At 1 year postoperatively, three of the 10 components had migration above the suggested limits for primary THA, indicating a high risk of loosening. Additionally, the contact surface achieved between the acetabular component and pelvis was found to be suboptimal, ranging from 11 to 17 cm(2) (15%-27% of each component). These findings suggest that alternative techniques may be necessary to achieve better initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetab"}
{"answers": "Despite high perioperative mortality, results document a sustainable recovery of the survivors offering the prospect of a highly independent and satisfying life. Therefore, advanced age alone should not be a contraindication for redo cardiac interventions. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2016; 16: 1138-1144.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that cardiac reoperations in octogenarians can be beneficial in terms of improving functional status and quality of life. The majority of patients in the study had a successful outcome, with low in-hospital mortality and a high rate of survival at follow-up. The patients who underwent reoperations had a significant improvement in their Barthel Index scores and New York Heart Association class, indicating improved functional status. Additionally, the summary scores of physical and mental health on the short form-12 questionnaire were similar to those of an age- and sex-matched normative population. These findings suggest that cardiac reoperations can be a viable option for octogenari"}
{"answers": "Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (ie, SMI) were more likely than other patients to be admitted to nursing homes with higher deficiency citations for both overall quality and clinical care quality. Further research is necessary to understand the reasons behind the disparity in quality of nursing home care associated with SMI.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patients with serious mental illness (SMI) are more likely to be admitted to nursing homes with more deficiencies in care compared to other patients. Specifically, patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder tend to enter nursing homes with more total and healthcare-related deficiencies, after controlling for various factors that may influence this association."}
{"answers": "Patients undergoing open access procedures are less likely to be properly informed about their endoscopic procedure. Our results indicate that with open access endoscopy, a defined mechanism needs to be in place for communication of endoscopic results to the patient.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that open access endoscopy may lead to inadequate informed consent and procedure acceptance, as patients in the open access group reported receiving less information and explanation about the procedure compared to the group referred from a gastrointestinal (GI) subspecialty clinic."}
{"answers": "Contrary to common belief, we found that uterine myomas commonly decrease in volume over the course of pregnancy.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, the majority of uterine myomas (55.1%) decreased in size during pregnancy, while 44.9% enlarged. However, the study also found that between the second and third trimesters, 75% of myomas became smaller, while 25% enlarged. These findings suggest that myomas may not always grow during pregnancy, and that some may even shrink."}
{"answers": "We found that all of the studied dimensions of restricted fetal growth are independently associated with increased risks of low intellectual performance and that these associations are only partly mediated by socioeconomic or familial factors.", "prediction_text": "No, the associations between birth characteristics and low intellectual performance in early adulthood are not significantly confounded by socioeconomic factors in adolescence or familial effects."}
{"answers": "Although feasible, double reading of barium enemas does not improve sensitivity for detection of polyps and produces a higher false-positive rate.", "prediction_text": "Double reading of barium enemas significantly increases the number of positive results and has the potential to alter clinical treatment in 9.9% of cases. However, the addition of a second reader does not significantly improve the specificity of the readings. The sensitivity for the detection of adenocarcinomas is 100%, but the specificity decreases for both the first and combined readings. Therefore, while double reading of barium enemas may be beneficial, it is not strictly necessary for all cases."}
{"answers": "The VMPA can provide direct access and favorable visibility to the TMJ region and yield good esthetic and functional results. The VMPA can be considered the approach of choice for common TMJ surgeries.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the vascular-guided multilayer preauricular approach (VMPA) to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) can improve access and reduce complications compared to traditional approaches. The study found that all patients had successful TMJ surgeries through the VMPA, with no patient developing permanent weakness of the facial nerve or other severe complications. Additionally, the incisions healed favorably with an uneventful recovery."}
{"answers": "The metastasis rate of station 9 lymph nodes was significantly lower than other mediastinal stations in lung cancer patients. The metastasis status of station 9 had no significant influence on tumor staging or prognosis. Routine dissection of station 9 lymph nodes may not be necessary, especially in patients with a low T stage, upper or middle lobe tumors, or without intrapulmonary lymph node metastasis.", "prediction_text": "Based on the study, routine dissection of station 9 lymph nodes is not necessary for primary lung cancer. The metastasis rate of station 9 was found to be significantly lower than other mediastinal stations, and the absence of metastasis in station 9 nodes did not significantly impact the prognosis of patients."}
{"answers": "During the time period considered, the FDA AED-related suicidality warning does not appear to have significantly affected prescription claims of AED medications for the study population.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no significant change in the trend of antiepileptic drug (AED) prescription claims among members with epilepsy and/or psychiatric disorder in Oklahoma Medicaid claims data after the FDA issued a warning about an increased risk of suicidality for all AEDs in 2009. In fact, the trend remained stable during and after the warning period, with a non-significant decrease in the monthly change in AED prescription claims during the warning period compared to the pre-warning period."}
{"answers": "In our population of stroke survivors, self-reports of motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions differed from government records. In future studies, the use of both government and self-reported data would ensure a more accurate picture of driving safety post-stroke.", "prediction_text": "There is a moderate agreement between government records (MTO) and self-reported data on motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions for stroke survivors, with a kappa coefficient of 0.52 for collisions and 0.47 for convictions. However, when both sources of data were consulted, up to 56% more accidents and up to 46% more convictions were identified in the study population in the 5 years before study entry compared to when either source was used alone."}
{"answers": "The realized communication skills courses resulted in relevant changes in communication behaviour and self-confidence of participants. Communication with terminally ill patients can be taught.", "prediction_text": "Yes, communication with terminally ill patients can be taught through a structured course model. The study demonstrated that participants' communication behavior improved significantly after participating in a 2-day course, as evidenced by increased sense of security in different communication settings and reported changes in communication behavior 3 months after the course."}
{"answers": "For conditions with a well-developed quality of care evidence base, such as hypertension and diabetes, a single structured implicit review to assess the quality of care over a period of time is moderately reliable. This method could be a reasonable complement or alternative to explicit indicator approaches for assessing and comparing quality of care. Structured implicit review, like explicit quality measures, must be used more cautiously for illnesses for which the evidence base is less well developed, such as COPD and acute, short-course illnesses.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a role for peer review in profiling quality of care, particularly for conditions with a well-established evidence base. The study found that the reliability of implicit review was higher for conditions with a more developed evidence base, such as diabetes and hypertension, compared to conditions with a less developed evidence base, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or a collection of acute conditions. This suggests that peer review can be a useful tool for identifying areas of high-quality care and areas where improvement is needed, particularly for conditions where there is a strong evidence base for best practices. However, it is important to note that peer review is not a perfect measure of quality and should be used"}
{"answers": "The high rate of unsuccessful IUD insertions reported here, particularly for nulliparous women, suggests that the true insertion failure rate of providers who are not employing additional tools for difficult insertions may be much higher than reported in clinical trials. Further investigation is necessary to determine if this is a common problem and, if so, to assess if the use of adjuvant measures will reduce the number of unsuccessful IUD insertions.", "prediction_text": "Yes, failed IUD insertions in community practice are an under-recognized problem. According to the study, the overall rate of unsuccessful IUD insertions was 19.6% among nulliparous women and 13.6% among parous women, indicating that a significant number of insertions were unsuccessful. The odds of failure were higher in nulliparous women compared to parous women, suggesting that inexperienced providers may be more likely to encounter difficulties during insertion. The study highlights the need for better training and support for providers performing IUD insertions in community settings."}
{"answers": "Even in capped health care systems, virtual planning and guided surgery including prebent or milled plates are financially viable.", "prediction_text": "Yes, virtual planning and guided surgery for head and neck reconstruction are economically viable. In this study, the additional cost of virtual planning was reduced by the time saved during surgery, indicating that the cost of planning is offset by the time saved. The cost of virtual planning and guided surgery was reduced from $5,098 to $1,231.50 with a prebent plate and from $6,980 to $3,113.50 for a milled plate."}
{"answers": "Bipolarity does not independently influence risk of suicidal behavior or alter the influence of well-established suicide risk factors within affective disorders. Suicide risk assessment strategies may continue to appraise these common risk factors without regard to mood polarity.", "prediction_text": "No, the risk factors for suicidal behavior do not differ by affective disorder polarity."}
{"answers": "The administration of polyvalent Crotalidae antivenin is safe. Acute hypersensitivity, when it occurs, consists solely in most cases of urticaria. Serious side effects are uncommon.", "prediction_text": "No, the aggressive use of polyvalent antivenin for rattlesnake bites does not result in serious acute side effects, such as death, amputations, or permanent disability, in the patients who received it. The study found that 18% of patients experienced acute side effects within the first 6 hours after administration, consisting mainly of urticaria, but no serious complications occurred."}
{"answers": "Although endomyocardial fibrosis patients have improved clinical symptoms after surgery, the global left ventricular ejection fraction and regional wall motion in these patients do not change. This finding suggests that other explanations, such as improvements in diastolic function, may be operational.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no change in quantitative left ventricular regional wall motion after fibrous tissue resection in endomyocardial fibrosis."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrates that laser pretreatment significantly increases absorption of topical lidocaine so that it is detectable in the blood and that manipulating laser settings can affect drug absorption. Future work will look at translating this effect into clinical benefit.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that fractional lasers can enhance transdermal absorption of topical lidocaine in an in vivo animal model. The peak levels of lidocaine and its metabolite monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) were significantly higher in the laser-treated skin compared to the untreated skin. The highest levels of lidocaine were achieved at an ablative depth of 250 \u00b5m, and the peak levels of MEGX were highest at the same depth. These findings suggest that fractional lasers can increase the transdermal delivery of lidocaine and may be a useful tool for improving the efficacy"}
{"answers": "Vaccines were exposed to temperatures that may reduce their potency. Safe storage of vaccines in the clinics cannot be ensured without adhering to the recommended guidelines. Provision of adequate equipment and training for staff in maintaining the \"cold chain\" and the use and care of equipment are important components of a successful immunisation programme.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that there was a weak link in the cold chain for the storage of vaccines in the community. Only a minority of general practices and child health clinics were aware of the appropriate storage conditions for vaccines, and many were not monitoring the temperature of their refrigerators properly. This suggests that there may be a risk of vaccines being exposed to subzero or inappropriate temperatures, which could compromise their effectiveness."}
{"answers": "p53 alteration detected by IHC or SSCP analysis is not a clinically useful predictor of local response to pre-operative adjuvant therapy in advanced rectal carcinoma.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that p53 alterations cannot be used to predict tumour response to pre-operative chemo-radiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer. The average reduction in tumour size was similar in the group with 'wild-type' p53 and the group with altered p53."}
{"answers": "The results of this study cast doubt on the suggested advantage of HBO in reducing patient mortality and morbidity when used as adjuvant therapy for NF.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) therapy may be beneficial in improving patient mortality and outcome in patients with necrotizing fasciitis (NF). The mortality rate was lower in the group that received HBO as part of their treatment protocol (36%) compared to the group that did not receive HBO (25%). However, the study also found that the HBO group required more surgical d\u00e9bridements per patient and had a longer hospital stay compared to the non-HBO group. Therefore, the indication for HBO therapy in NF remains controversial and further studies are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "High doses of ZNS are effective and safe in pharmacoresistant epileptic patients. Therapeutic drug monitoring of ZNS may be considered at therapeutic failure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, high doses of zonisamide (>500 mg/d) may be effective and well-tolerated in adult patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy, including those with focal and generalized seizure types. In this study of 9 patients, 55% achieved a 50% or greater seizure reduction, and 66% showed good tolerance to other antiepileptic drugs. However, adverse events occurred in 37% of patients. Plasma levels of zonisamide were within the therapeutic range in 2 patients."}
{"answers": "In conclusion, high Ki-67 expression was associated with poor survival in patients with UTUC, as well as a high risk of disease progression, although these findings need to be interpreted with caution. Large-scale, adequately designed, prospective trials are needed to further confirm the value of Ki-67 in prognosis of UTUC patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that overexpression of Ki-67 is a prognostic biomarker of upper tract urinary carcinoma (UTUC). The study conducted an immunohistochemical analysis of Ki-67 expression in UTUC tissues and found that patients with muscle-invasive tumors (T2-T4) had higher Ki-67 expression than those with non-muscle-invasive tumors (Tis-T1). Additionally, the study found that high Ki-67 expression was associated with poorer cancer-specific survival (CSS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in UTUC patients, and this association"}
{"answers": "After comparing MR with arthroscopic findings and reviewing the available literature, we conclude that arthroscopy permits the direct visualization of even fine articular surface changes but does not depict the subchondral bone, the most frequent site of injury detected with MRI. MRI was a very useful tool in the detection and characterization of the different types of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries and showed a statistically significant correlation between site and distribution of bone and cartilage injuries and between internal damage and trauma mechanisms. Therefore, we believe that MRI can help avoid diagnostic arthroscopy in the patients with a history of post-traumatic pain, acute articular blocks and negative radiographic findings.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used as a substitute for diagnostic arthroscopy in the detection and characterization of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries in the knee, particularly in cases where the injury is located in the lateral compartment or the knee cap. The study found that MRI was able to identify all types of occult post-traumatic injuries, including bone bruises, subchondral injuries, and osteochondral injuries, with a high degree of accuracy. However, it is important to note that MRI may not be able to detect all types of injuries, particularly those that are located"}
{"answers": "The prevalence of cognitive impairment in MND in this population based study of an unselected cohort was higher than has been previously reported. Language deficits, especially anomia, may be relatively frequent in the MND population. Aphasia in MND may be masked by dysarthria and missed if not specifically examined.", "prediction_text": "Yes, dementia and aphasia are underrecognized associations in motor neuron disease. The study found that 28% of patients with motor neuron disease had significant cognitive deficits, including dementia and aphasia."}
{"answers": "Postoperative numbness occurs in most patients receiving nasal microfat injections. Partial to complete recovery of nasal tip sensation can be expected to occur over a 3-month period.", "prediction_text": "Yes, sensation gradually returns to the nasal tip after microfat grafting. The study found that the touch threshold value decreased significantly immediately after the injection, but recovered gradually during the follow-up period, with the majority of the sensation returning by 12 weeks after the procedure."}
{"answers": "Conveyance of emotions or movements through music may be decoded differently by persons with different types of communication disorders. Because music is the primary therapeutic tool in music therapy sessions, clinicians should consider these differential abilities when selecting music for clinical interventions focusing on emotions or movement.", "prediction_text": "Yes, communication disorders can extend to musical messages. The study found that children with severe to profound hearing loss (using cochlear implants) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) had difficulty recognizing symbolic representation of emotions or movements in music, compared to children with typical development and normal hearing. The CI group was significantly less accurate than the other two groups in identifying both emotions and movements."}
{"answers": "For some patients, using colour to describe their pain experience may be a useful tool to improve doctor-patient communication.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that patients can use colour to describe osteoarthritis pain, with the majority of participants associating red with high-intensity pain and purity with the absence of pain. However, there were some limitations and challenges to using colour to describe pain, such as the need for standardization and interpretability of colour meanings."}
{"answers": "It appears safe to administer intensive chemotherapy regimens at standard doses to rural patients without increased morbidity or mortality. Support for general practitioners through phone or videoconferencing may reduce the safety concerns.", "prediction_text": "The study found that intensive chemotherapy is safe for rural cancer patients. There was no significant difference in the rate of serious adverse events, such as febrile neutropenia, diarrhea, and vomiting, between urban and rural patients. Additionally, no toxic deaths occurred in either group. These findings suggest that administering intensive chemotherapy to rural patients at the same doses as urban patients is safe and effective."}
{"answers": "Although outcomes for EPSCC remains poor, both surgery and radiation is shown to significantly improve median, 5- and 10-year survival rates. EPSCC patients who are potential candidates for surgical resection or radiation therapy may benefit from these treatments.", "prediction_text": "Yes, surgery and radiation therapy have a significant impact on survival for patients with extrapulmonary small cell cancers. Specifically, patients with gastrointestinal and genitourinary EPSCC had improved median, 5- and 10-year survival with surgery and/or radiation therapy for all stages and sizes. Multivariate analysis revealed age, gender, stage, radiation, and surgery to be independent predictors of survival for all EPSCCs."}
{"answers": "DGE after PPPD seems to be of minor clinical importance following uncomplicated surgery. When taking the results into consideration, it can be said that, despite the lack of a control group, antecolic duodenojejunostomy might be the key to a low incidence of DGE after PPPD. In our experience, DGE is linked to the occurrence of other postoperative complications rather than to pylorus preservation.", "prediction_text": "No, the incidence of delayed gastric emptying (DGE) after pancreaticoduodenectomy is not significantly related to pylorus preservation. The study found that the overall incidence of DGE was 12% in the group of patients where the pylorus was preserved, and 3% in the group where postoperative complications other than DGE occurred."}
{"answers": "In women with POP, the symptom of pelvic pain is associated with the presence of defecatory symptoms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, pelvic pain is associated with defecatory symptoms in women with pelvic organ prolapse (POP). The study found that women with pelvic pain were more likely to experience straining with bowel movement, sense of incomplete emptying, pain with bowel movement, and splinting with bowel movement compared to those without pelvic pain."}
{"answers": "The results confirm that c-kit is vastly expressed in uveal melanoma, suggest that the c-kit molecular pathway may be important in uveal melanoma growth, and point to its use as a target for therapy with STI571.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that c-Kit-dependent growth of uveal melanoma cells may be a potential therapeutic target. The study found that c-Kit is strongly expressed and tyrosine phosphorylated in cultured uveal melanoma cells, and that treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 resulted in cell death. The IC(50) of the inhibitory effects on c-Kit phosphorylation and cell proliferation was found to be less than 2.5 microM, indicating a potent inhibitory effect. These findings suggest that targeting c-Kit may be a promising therape"}
{"answers": "Results suggest that telmisartan may reduce type-I diabetes mellitus-induced hepatic injury by suppressing activated hepatic stellate cells through concomitant TGF-beta1 down-regulation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, telmisartan prevents hepatic fibrosis in rats with alloxan-induced diabetes. The study found a significant difference in the numerical density of hepatocytes between the diabetic control group and the diabetic rats treated with telmisartan, suggesting that telmisartan protects against hepatic degeneration. Additionally, the study found no immunoreactivity of TGF-beta in the liver sections of the diabetic rats treated with telmisartan, indicating that telmisartan may inhibit the role of TGF-beta in diabetes-related hepatic fibrosis."}
{"answers": "The great majority of U.S. renal transplant centers will not transplant kidneys to HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease, even if their infection is asymptomatic. However, advances in the management of HIV infection and a review of relevant ethical issues suggest that this approach should be reconsidered.", "prediction_text": "According to the survey, the majority of U.S. transplant centers would not transplant a kidney into an asymptomatic HIV-infected patient, even if they are otherwise a good candidate for transplantation. The main concerns are that transplantation in the face of HIV infection would be harmful to the individual and a waste of precious organs. Therefore, it can be concluded that the current policy of excluding HIV-infected patients from transplantation is still in place."}
{"answers": "The overall yield of SL for HCC was 7 %, and the accuracy was 27 %. When accurate imaging methods are available and additional percutaneous liver biopsy is implemented as a standard procedure in the preoperative workup of patients with HCC, the benefit of SL will become even less.", "prediction_text": "The study found that staging laparoscopy (SL) for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not very useful in determining the resectability of the tumor, with a yield of only 7% and an accuracy of 27%. However, the biopsy of the non-tumorous liver can provide valuable information on fibrosis/cirrhosis, leading to changes in management for 17% of patients."}
{"answers": "Expert breast pathology assessments continue to be necessary in the management of DCIS.", "prediction_text": "Yes, expert breast pathology assessment is necessary for the management of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The study found that secondary pathology assessments led to a change in the assessment of local recurrence risk in 29% and contributed to a change in treatment recommendation in 43% of cases, highlighting the importance of expert breast pathology assessment in accurately evaluating the risk of recurrence and guiding treatment decisions."}
{"answers": "Vaginal pH should be measured by bringing the pH strip in direct contact with fresh vaginal fluid without first adding saline.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that measuring pH from a wet mount slide does not provide accurate results. The addition of saline to the slide caused systematic increases in pH, leading to false positive readings for all types of vaginal infections and flora disturbances, regardless of whether the sample was normal, intermediate, or abnormal."}
{"answers": "This study presents a different clinical picture of oral mucoceles/ranulas, as observed in HIV-positive patients. Additionally, it suggests a possible clinical link between the two pathologies. The authors strongly support the suggestion that oral mucocele/ranula is an HIV-related salivary gland disease.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that oral mucocele/ranula is another HIV-related salivary gland disease, with a higher incidence among HIV-positive patients compared to HIV-negative patients."}
{"answers": "There are no data to support the widespread practice of using central venous pressure to guide fluid therapy. This approach to fluid resuscitation should be abandoned.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the central venous pressure (CVP) predicts fluid responsiveness in adult patients, with a summary area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.56 (95% CI, 0.54-0.58) across all studies. This means that CVP has moderate accuracy in detecting fluid responders, with a sensitivity of 57% and a specificity of 43%. The AUC was similar in intensive care unit (ICU) and operating room (OR) patients, at 0.56 (95% CI, 0.52-0.58) and 0.56 (95%"}
{"answers": "Increased D-dimer levels should not be considered as a diagnostic parameter in diagnosis of acute appendicitis.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found no significant difference in D-dimer levels between histopathologic study groups, and therefore, D-dimer cannot be considered a new diagnostic parameter for acute appendicitis."}
{"answers": "Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mitochondria play a role in remodeling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death (PCD). The study found that mitochondrial dynamics, including distribution, motility, and membrane potential, change during PCD in the lace plant. The formation of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) may also play a role in PCD. In vivo treatment with cyclosporine A (CsA) resulted in leaves with mitochondrial dynamics similar to those of non-PCD cells, and a lower number of perforations compared to controls.

{"answers": "Our study emphasised the discomfort of transurethral urinary catheters, especially in male patients, and the high incidence of urinary tract infections in both sexes. Consideration should be given to the utilisation of alternative methods of bladder drainage, such as suprapubic catheterisation, which can be performed with ease during laparotomy.", "prediction_text": "No, transurethral catheterization is not the ideal method of bladder drainage according to the study. Male patients were more dissatisfied with the procedure and experienced more pain during catheterization and removal, and half of the patients developed symptoms of urinary tract infection after catheter removal. These findings suggest that transurethral catheterization may not be the most comfortable or effective method of bladder drainage."}
{"answers": "Based on this pilot data, MASCC score appears promising in determining suitability for outpatient management of NF in gynecologic oncology patients. Prospective study is ongoing to confirm safety and determine impact on cost.", "prediction_text": "Yes, risk stratification is useful for inpatient versus outpatient management of neutropenic fever in gynecologic oncology patients. In this study, patients who were considered high risk based on the MASCC risk index score were more likely to experience severe complications, multiple severe complications, ICU admission, overall mortality, and death due to neutropenic fever. The MASCC score had a positive predictive value of 50% and negative predictive value of 90%. These findings suggest that risk stratification can help identify patients who are at high risk of complications and may benefit from inpatient management, while those who are at low risk can be"}
{"answers": "Halofantrine has mild to moderate pathological effects on cochlea histology, and can be considered an ototoxic drug.", "prediction_text": "Yes, halofantrine is ototoxic. The study found that halofantrine caused loss and distortion of inner hair cells, inner phalangeal cells, and spiral ganglia cells in guinea pigs. This suggests that halofantrine may cause damage to the inner ear and could potentially lead to hearing loss in humans."}
{"answers": "Proportionally fewer elderly patients with OPSCC are being treated than younger individuals. These patients can have significant benefits from aggressive treatments despite their older age as shown by our survival analysis. We recommend the use of objective measures to assess patient fitness to reduce the potential for undertreatment in the elderly population.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that elderly patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) are undertreated, particularly those aged 65-74 and 75-84 years. The analysis showed that these age groups had a significant benefit in disease-specific survival (DSS) with surgery, radiation, or combined therapy compared to younger age groups. However, multivariate analysis did not demonstrate any statistically significant difference in the hazard ratios for combined treatment among the age groups."}
{"answers": "Minimal access surgery for the repair of esophageal atresia or congenital diaphragmatic hernia is not associated with less cumulative opioid doses.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that the cumulative opioid doses at 12, 24, 48 hours and 7 days postoperatively did not significantly differ between the minimal access surgery (MAS) group and the control group for both congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) and esophageal atresia (EA) patients."}
{"answers": "Clinical predictors appear inadequate for the evaluation of the cervical spine in geriatric trauma patients with low-energy mechanism.", "prediction_text": "No, clinical predictors are not adequate in identifying cervical spine fractures in geriatric blunt trauma patients with low-energy mechanism."}
{"answers": "European individuals with type 1 diabetes consume a high atherogenic diet as few patients met recommendations for dietary fibre and saturated fat. This study showed minor changes in dietary nutrients and energy intakes over a period of 7 years. Nutrition education needs particular focus on strategies to increase dietary fibre and reduce saturated fat to exploit their potential benefit.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that the nutrient intake of European individuals with type 1 diabetes did not significantly change over a 7-year period, and they did not consume a high atherogenic diet. In fact, there were minor improvements in the intake of some nutrients, such as protein, fat, and cholesterol, and poor adherence to European recommendations for fibre and saturated fat intake."}
{"answers": "The gaps in patella eversion demonstrated smaller gaps both in knee extension and flexion position compared to the gaps of patella reduction position. The amount of decreased gaps was more definite in knee flexion position. Therefore, the intraoperative patellar positioning has influence on the measurement of the joint gap. Keeping the patella in reduced position is important during gap balancing.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patella position significantly influences ligament balancing in total knee arthroplasty. The study found that the gaps in patella eversion were smaller than those in patella reduction in both knee extension and flexion positions. The difference in gaps was more pronounced in knee flexion position. Additionally, there was significant variability in knee flexion position, with 24% of knees with patella subluxation and 66% of knees with patella eversion demonstrating either increased or decreased gaps in knee flexion position compared to the gaps of patella reduction position. These findings suggest that patella position should be taken into account"}
{"answers": "We have thus provided compelling evidence that there is a mossy fiber GABAergic signal. The physiologic role of this mossy fiber GABAergic signal is uncertain, but may be of developmental importance. Other evidence suggests that this GABAergic signal is transiently upregulated after seizures. This could have an inhibitory or disinhibitory effect, and further work is needed to elucidate its actual role.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mossy fibers release GABA. The paper you provided evidence for this by using hippocampal slices from guinea pigs and making whole-cell voltage clamp recordings from CA3 pyramidal cells. The study found that electrical stimuli that recruit dentate granule cells elicit monosynaptic GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic signals in CA3 pyramidal neurons, indicating that mossy fibers release GABA."}
{"answers": "Men and women in this community sample reported similar patterns of depressive symptoms. No evidence that the presentation of depressive symptoms differs by gender was found.", "prediction_text": "No, there were no significant gender differences in the self-report of depression symptoms even after adjusting for other covariates."}
{"answers": "Time to primary treatment after a diagnosis of breast cancer had no impact on overall survival. Further studies on care before diagnosis are important in drawing up meaningful quality indicators.", "prediction_text": "No, delays in time to primary treatment after a diagnosis of breast cancer do not significantly impact survival, according to this study."}
{"answers": "Our findings reveal a significant decrease in ADMA levels of ex-ELBW subjects compared to C, underlining a probable correlation with preterm birth and low birth weight. Taken together, these results may underlie the onset of early circulatory dysfunction predictive of increased cardiovascular risk.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that young adults born preterm at extremely low birth weights (<1000 g) had significantly lower levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) compared to healthy adults born at term. Additionally, there was a negative correlation between ADMA levels and gestational age and birth weight in the preterm group, suggesting that ADMA levels may be a predictor of early endothelial dysfunction in this population."}
{"answers": "ECL assays improved the ability to predict time to diabetes in these autoantibody-positive relatives at risk for developing diabetes. These findings might be helpful in the design and eligibility criteria for prevention trials in the future.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assays can improve the prediction of time to type 1 diabetes in the TrialNet autoantibody-positive population. Subjects who were positive for ECL autoantibodies had a significantly higher risk of developing diabetes compared to those who were negative for ECL autoantibodies. Additionally, adding ECL to the Diabetes Prevention Trial risk score (DPTRS) improved the accuracy of predicting time to diabetes."}
{"answers": "These findings indicate that a relationship between multiple sclerosis and streptococcal infections may exist, but to acquire a better understanding of the role of group A streptococci in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, more studies with animal models are necessary.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant relationship between streptococcal infection and multiple sclerosis (MS). The study found that patients with MS had higher levels of antideoxyribonuclease B (ADNase B) compared to healthy controls, indicating a possible association between streptococcal infection and the development of MS."}
{"answers": "Aplastic anemia is associated with a variety of autoimmune syndromes. The sequence of events in our patient suggests that the hepatic failure, AFOP, and the VSAA may all have been part of an autoimmune syndrome. AFOP could be the result of immune dysregulation in this pediatric case with favorable outcome after immunosuppressive therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP) is believed to be an immune-mediated disorder. In the case study described in the medical paper, the patient's development of AFOP was associated with very severe aplastic anemia (VSAA), which is also an immune-mediated disorder. The use of immunosuppressive therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation were able to improve the patient's condition, suggesting that AFOP is indeed related to immune dysregulation."}
{"answers": "Rescue AC may apply to only 18% of cases, and we identified subsets of more likely candidates.", "prediction_text": "The study found that only 17.9% of women remained pregnant for more than one week after receiving antenatal corticosteroids, and that those who delivered within two weeks of receiving the medication were more likely to deliver at less than 34 weeks of gestation. This suggests that there may be a limited window of opportunity for rescue corticosteroid treatment to prolong pregnancy."}
{"answers": "The results show that fatigue in patients with pSS and sSS is not due to the coexistence of FM in most cases. A lower incidence in the United Kingdom of FM in patients with pSS was found than has been previously reported.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant link between fatigue and fibromyalgia (FM) in patients with primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (pSS). The study found that 68% of patients with pSS reported fatigue, which is a significantly higher prevalence than in the lupus group (50%). Additionally, none of the patients with pSS and Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome/secondary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (sSS) had FM, while 12% of patients with pSS and 5% of patients with lupus had FM. These findings suggest that there is a strong association between fatigue and FM in patients with pSS."}
{"answers": "UDR provides an objective measurement of VUR and appears as a predictive tool of success after endoscopic injection.", "prediction_text": "Yes, distal ureteral diameter (UD) can predict reflux resolution after endoscopic injection in children with primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). In this study, the UD and the UD ratio (UDR) were significant predictors of reflux resolution on logistic regression analysis."}
{"answers": ": Data from both association and expression studies suggested that variants at HINT1 may be associated with schizophrenia and the associations may be sex-specific. However, the markers showing associations were in high LD to the SPEC2/PDZ-GEF2/ACSL6 locus reported previously in the same samples. This made it difficult to separate the association signals amongst these genes. Other independent studies may be necessary to distinguish these candidate genes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1) gene has been identified as a candidate for schizophrenia in several studies. The gene is located on chromosome 5q31.2, which is a region that has been implicated in the disorder. The study found nominally significant differences in allele frequencies in several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) around the HINT1 gene in both the Irish study of high density schizophrenia families (ISHDSF) and the Irish case control study of schizophrenia (ICCSS), with significant interactions amongst sex, diagnosis, and rs3864"}
{"answers": "Out of the four sacral sparing criteria, the acute phase anal sensory score measurements do not contribute significantly to the prognosis of independent ambulation. The combination of the acute phase voluntary anal contraction and the S4-5 LT and PP scores, predicts significantly better chronic phase-independent ambulation outcomes than the currently used distinction between complete and incomplete SCI.", "prediction_text": "No, the determination between complete and incomplete traumatic spinal cord injury is not clinically relevant for predicting independent ambulation at 1 year post-injury. The use of a combination of voluntary anal contraction and sensory scores at the S4-5 level (AUC: 0.906, P<0.001) was found to be more accurate in predicting independent ambulation than the current distinction between complete and incomplete spinal cord injury (AUC: 0.823, P<0.001)."}
{"answers": "These findings suggest that schizophrenia is associated with progressive structural brain abnormalities, affecting both gray and white matter. We found no evidence to suggest progressive medial temporal lobe involvement but did find evidence that this may be partly explained by heterogeneity between studies in patient age and illness duration. The causes and clinical correlates of these progressive brain changes should now be the focus of investigation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there are progressive brain changes in schizophrenia. The meta-analysis found that patients with schizophrenia showed significantly greater decreases in volume over time in various brain regions, including the whole brain, frontal gray and white matter, parietal white matter, and temporal white matter, compared to healthy control subjects. Additionally, there were larger increases in lateral ventricular volume in patients with schizophrenia. These findings suggest that there are progressive brain changes in schizophrenia over time."}
{"answers": "The elevated risk of death after CABG surgery known previously to be associated with CDM seems also to be shared by a group of similar size that includes patients with IFG and undiagnosed DM.", "prediction_text": "Yes, even impaired fasting blood glucose levels (IFG) below the diagnostic threshold for diabetes mellitus (DM) are associated with increased mortality after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. The study found that patients with IFG had a higher risk of 30-day and 1-year mortality compared to those with normal fasting blood glucose levels."}
{"answers": "This is the first known report of concurrent plasma and ISF concentrations of a meropenem antibiotic during CVVHDF. We observed that the ISF concentrations of meropenem were significantly lower than the plasma concentrations, although the present dose was appropriate for infections caused by intermediately susceptible pathogens (MIC\u22644 mg/L).", "prediction_text": "Yes, interstitial fluid (ISF) concentrations of meropenem in critically ill patients receiving continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) are equivalent to plasma concentrations. The study found that the ISF trough concentrations were similar to plasma trough concentrations, and the ISF penetration was estimated to be around 63-69%. The plasma elimination half-life, volume of distribution, total clearance, and CVVHDF clearance were also similar between ISF and plasma."}
{"answers": "Despite advances in early diagnosis and surgical technique, 5-year survival of stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma remains low as compared to survival of other solid organ neoplasm. Tumour size<or=3cm, adenocarcinoma histologic type and negative bronchial resection margins were associated with a more favourable outcome in our patient population. More effective multimodality treatments are needed to increase survival rates.", "prediction_text": "The prognostic significance of various surgical-pathologic variables in patients with Stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) was investigated in the study. The results suggest that histology (adenocarcinoma vs squamous cell carcinoma), tumor size (<3cm vs >3cm), and the presence of a negative resection margin are significant prognostic factors for overall 5-year survival. However, the difference in survival rates between T1N0 and T2N0 disease was not statistically significant. Therefore, while Stage I NSCLC may seem like an early stage, the prognosis can vary depending on various factors, and careful evaluation"}
{"answers": "There is a knowledge deficit regarding the SU treatment goal among gout patients receiving ULT, despite generally high levels of other gout-specific knowledge. SU goal information may be an important and underutilized concept among providers treating gout patients.", "prediction_text": "Only 14% of gout patients in the study knew their target serum urate (SU) goal, while the majority answered correctly for the other 5 gout-specific knowledge questions. Having a rheumatologist as the initial prescriber and knowing the other 5 gout-specific knowledge questions were associated with greater odds of knowing the SU goal."}
{"answers": "Despite government assistance, low-income individuals use vision care services less often than wealthy individuals.", "prediction_text": "Yes, government-funded low-income vision care programs in Canada improve utilization of eye care services by low-income individuals, particularly among those who experience financial difficulty. The study found that individuals who had difficulty paying for basic expenses were less likely to utilize eye care services compared to those without financial difficulty. Additionally, the study found that the prevalence ratio of utilization among those with financial difficulty was significantly lower compared to those without financial difficulty, indicating that government assistance improves access to eye care services among low-income individuals."}
{"answers": "Premature births from rural mothers have a higher risk of stillbirth and mortality in neonatal intensive care than urban infants.", "prediction_text": "Yes, rural residence is associated with poorer outcomes in premature infants, including higher mortality rates and a higher stillbirth rate, compared to urban residence in the state of New South Wales (NSW) and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT)."}
{"answers": "Altered ET-1 levels may be involved in the pathogenesis of rebound hypertension and hypotension during HD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is evidence to suggest that endothelin-1 (ET-1) plays a role in the hemodynamic changes during hemodialysis (HD). In this study, the levels of ET-1 were measured in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) during HD and compared to levels in healthy controls. The results showed that the levels of ET-1 were higher in dialysis patients compared to controls before HD, but did not change significantly in the three HD groups. However, the post-dialysis ET-1 levels were significantly different between the three groups, with a decrease in group I and an increase in group III compared to predialysis values. These find"}
{"answers": "While FS was commonly used in patients undergoing thyroidectomy at our institution, in no patient over the last decade did FS correctly alter the intraoperative management. Given the time required to perform FS and the cost associated with it, we believe that routine FS should not be performed in these patients.", "prediction_text": "No, the frozen section (FS) did not alter the intraoperative management of multinodular thyroid disease in the study population."}
{"answers": "Elderly patients have informational and relational needs similar to those of younger patients. In fact, most of the whole sample flagged up the need for higher levels of satisfaction especially concerning a better dialogue with health staff, along with a new factor: the need to talk to people with the same illness.", "prediction_text": "Yes, elderly cancer patients have different care needs compared with younger patients. The study found that older patients were more likely to request financial-insurance information, the need to talk to people with the same illness, and the need for a better dialogue with clinicians. Few significant differences were found between the two age subgroups, with the exception of issues such as the need for intimacy and support."}
{"answers": "According to the results of our study and the data from the international literature, the entity globulomaxillary cyst is no longer justified.", "prediction_text": "The term \"globulomaxillary cyst\" is no longer considered a valid diagnostic entity, as it was previously thought to be a distinct type of cyst. However, similar cystic lesions in the region of the nasal and maxillary processes still occur and can be classified into different entities based on their clinical, radiological, and histological features. In this study, the authors analyzed 17 cases of previously diagnosed globulomaxillary cysts and found that they actually represented a mix of different cystic lesions, including lateral periodontal cysts, radicular cysts, keratocystic odontogenic tumors, ad"}
{"answers": "Although components of the CSM (cognitive and emotional representations, coping strategies) were associated with fears of recurrence, optimism was found to be the strongest predictor of fear, independent of anxiety and level of fear reported prior to treatment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, according to the study, pre-treatment fears and optimism can predict long-term fears of recurrence in head and neck cancer survivors."}
{"answers": "Older adults enrolled in PICT with more symptoms may sacrifice QOL for experimental treatment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, symptoms do matter when considering patients for phase I clinical trials in older adults with advanced cancer. In this study, older adults with more symptoms had more admissions, complications, and greater decline in functional status compared to those with fewer symptoms."}
{"answers": "Effective CPAP treatment in IPF patients with OSA results in a significant improvement in daily living activities based on the FOSQ, namely an OSA-specific follow-up instrument. Improvement was also noted in other questionnaires assessing quality of life, though not to a statistically significant degree, probably because of the multifactorial influences of IPF on physical and mental health. The probability of poor CPAP compliance was high and could only be eliminated with intense follow-up by the CPAP clinic staff.", "prediction_text": "Yes, CPAP therapy offers a better quality of life and sleep in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The study found a statistically significant improvement in the Functional Outcomes in Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ) at 1, 3, and 6 months after CPAP initiation. The FOSQ scores improved from 12.9 \u00b1 2.9 at baseline to 15.8 \u00b1 2.1 at 6 months, indicating a significant improvement in overall sleep quality. Additionally, there was a trend towards improvement in the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (E"}
{"answers": "Income support policy may be a significant new lever for improving population health, especially that of lower-income persons. Even though the findings are robust, further analyses are needed to confirm their reliability. Future research should examine a variety of different income support policies, as well as whether a broader range of social and economic policies affect health.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program is found to reduce disability among the elderly. Specifically, the study found that an increase of $100 per month in the maximum SSI benefit was associated with a 0.46 percentage point decrease in the rate of mobility limitations among single elderly individuals. The findings were robust to various sensitivity analyses, including limiting the analysis to subgroups more likely to receive SSI, using different disability measures, and controlling for potential confounders such as Medicaid coverage."}
{"answers": "None of the clinical identifiers for early-stage adhesive capsulitis previously proposed by expert consensus have been validated in this study. Clinicians should be aware that commonly used clinical identifiers may not be applicable to this stage.", "prediction_text": "The study found that among the 8 clinical identifiers proposed in an earlier Delphi study, only pain at the end of range of all measured active movements was associated with a positive anesthetic response (PAR) in diagnosing early-stage primary/idiopathic adhesive capsulitis. The other proposed identifiers were not found to be significantly associated with a PAR."}
{"answers": "Despite current recommendations, cough and cold medicines are still used in children younger than 6 years of age. A significant portion of caregivers report that they are still unaware of public warnings, potential side effects, and interactions with other medications.", "prediction_text": "Yes, concerns about the use of cold preparations in young children still exist, as 72% of caregivers incorrectly dosed the medication they desired to give during the study."}
{"answers": "Vitamin C reduces the prevalence of complex regional pain syndrome after wrist fractures. A daily dose of 500 mg for fifty days is recommended.", "prediction_text": "Yes, vitamin C can prevent complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) in patients with wrist fractures. The study found that patients who received vitamin C had a significantly lower incidence of CRPS compared to those who received a placebo. The effect was dose-dependent, with the highest incidence of CRPS occurring in the placebo group. Early cast-related complaints were also found to be a predictor of CRPS development."}
{"answers": "The tendency to clear one's plate when eating is associated with increased body weight and may constitute a risk factor for weight gain.", "prediction_text": "Yes, plate clearing is associated with increased body weight in a cohort of US adults. Individuals who tend to clear their plates more often are more likely to have a higher BMI."}
{"answers": "ACS is common in patients with SCD who present with fever and was grossly underestimated by evaluating physicians. History and physical examination appear to be of little value in defining which febrile patients require CXR. In view of the mortality and morbidity associated with ACS, empiric CXR should be considered when evaluating a febrile patient with SCD.", "prediction_text": "No, clinician assessment for acute chest syndrome (ACS) in febrile patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) is not accurate enough. The study found that only 39% of physicians were able to accurately diagnose ACS based on clinical evaluation, and even completely normal physical examination findings were seen in 57% of patients with ACS."}
{"answers": "We conclude that the quality of rectal cancer excision, as defined by mesorectal grades, achieved by supervised colorectal trainees is comparable with that achieved by consultants.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no significant difference in the quality of total mesorectal excision (TME) surgery between supervised colorectal trainees and consultants, as measured by mesorectal grades."}
{"answers": "Dutch primary schools could play a more important role in fostering healthy eating habits among children. The school food policy could be improved by clearly formulating food rules, simplifying supervision of the food rules, and defining how to enforce the food rules. In addition, the school food policy will only influence children's dietary behaviour if both the school and the parents support the policy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is room for improvement in the school food policy at Dutch primary schools. While most schools have a written food policy, the rules are not always clearly defined, and teachers and principals feel that parents are primarily responsible for encouraging healthy eating habits among children. Parents generally appreciate the policy, but there is variation in their opinions on the enforcement of the policy."}
{"answers": "Speed discrimination, per se, is not impaired in schizophrenia patients. The observed abnormality appears to be a consequence of impairment in generating or integrating the feedback information from eye movements. This study introduces a novel approach to motion perception studies and highlights the importance of concurrently measuring eye movements to understand interactions between these two systems; the results argue for a conceptual revision regarding motion perception abnormality in schizophrenia.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the motion perception deficit in schizophrenia is not solely a consequence of eye-tracking abnormality. While there was a significant difference in speed discrimination thresholds between schizophrenia patients and control subjects at a longer stimulus duration (300 msec), the frequency of eye tracking during the 300 msec stimulus was significantly correlated with speed discrimination in control subjects but not in patients. This suggests that eye-tracking initiation may benefit control subjects but not patients, and that other factors may be involved in the motion perception deficit in schizophrenia."}
{"answers": "(1) There is little overlap between regions of CFAEs during AF and regions of SRF measured in the time domain or the frequency domain, (2) the majority of SRF appears to occur in regions with wave-front collision, (3) the distribution of SRF is similar in patients with AF and normal controls, suggesting that this may not have an important role in AF maintenance and may not be a suitable ablation target.", "prediction_text": "There is no significant correlation between complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAEs) recorded during atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm fractionation (SRF) in the left atrium. The two types of electrograms do not overlap significantly, and there is no difference in the distribution of SRF between patients with atrial fibrillation and normal controls."}
{"answers": "Continence function remained undisturbed after anastomotic leakage due to rectal resection", "prediction_text": "According to the study, anastomotic leakage does not significantly affect the functional outcome after rectal resection for cancer, as measured by the Cleveland Clinic Continence Score. However, there was a slight but not significant decrease in maximum tolerable volume and rectal compliance in patients who experienced anastomotic leakage."}
{"answers": "No evidence was found for OPLL to have any effect on the initial neurologic status or recovery in motor function after traumatic cervical cord injury, suggesting that the neurologic outcome is not significantly dependent on canal space.", "prediction_text": "No, ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) does not significantly affect the neurological outcome after traumatic cervical spinal cord injury (SCI). The study found that there was no difference in the mean improvement rate in ASIA motor score between the OPLL+ group and the OPLL- group, and no significant correlation was observed between the static/dynamic canal diameters and neurologic outcome in all 129 patients."}
{"answers": "Circumferences and related ratios scale significantly to height, notably after adjustment for age and race, across subjects who are representative of the US population. These observations have implications for the clinical and epidemiologic use of these anthropometric measures and indexes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, adult body circumferences (waist circumference (WC) and hip circumference (HC)) are associated with height in a non-linear manner. After adjusting for age, race, and self-reported health status, the study found that WC and HC scaled to height with powers of 0.76 \u00b1 0.08 and 0.45 \u00b1 0.05 in men, and 0.80 \u00b1 0.05 and 0.53 \u00b1 0.04 in women, respectively. This means that for every one-centimeter increase in height, WC and HC increased by approximately 0.76"}
{"answers": "We found evidence that pain can be a significant clinical problem in psychiatric patients which seems to be underestimated in psychiatry. The investigated patients in general adult psychiatry are characterized by specific risk factors different from clinical subpopulations of other disciplines.", "prediction_text": "Yes, pain is a clinically relevant problem in general adult psychiatry, with a high prevalence of pain complaints among psychiatric patients, particularly among those with affective disorders and those with a history of depression. The study found that nearly 50% of patients experienced pain at the time of the survey, and over 75% experienced pain in the past 6 months and 12 months. The most common pain locations were the low back, headache, and shoulder and neck. The study also identified depression and number of past hospital admissions as statistically significant risk factors for pain."}
{"answers": "This study found that influences on coping were multifactorial and moderated by age. These factors have implications for interventions designed to enhance coping strategies.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that older adults reported lower levels of dysfunctional coping strategies than younger adults, and that personality disorder had a weaker effect on coping style in older adults compared to younger adults."}
{"answers": "The study data suggests a possible correlation between cervical discopathy and cervical MS plaque.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant relation between cervical cord plaques and discopathy in patients with multiple sclerosis. In this study, 69.1% of patients with both cervical discopathy and cervical cord plaques had plaques at the same site as the discopathy."}
{"answers": "Higher MCVs and AST/ALT ratios in ASH reflect the severity of underlying liver disease and do not differentiate NASH from ASH. Instead, these biomarkers might prove useful in guiding selection of patients for liver biopsy and in targeting therapy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, routine laboratory markers can be useful in differentiating nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) from alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH). The study found that the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) was elevated in ASH patients and normal in NASH patients, with a high sensitivity and specificity for differentiating between the two conditions. Additionally, the AST/ALT ratio and sex were also found to be relevant regressors in differentiating between NASH and ASH. However, it is important to note that the study had a small sample size and further larger-scale studies are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "We found no evidence that IBR compromised the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy, although there was a significant incidence of implant infection.", "prediction_text": "No, immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) does not significantly compromise the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy. The study found that the overall complication rates were comparable between the IBR and mastectomy alone groups, and the median time to chemotherapy was not significantly different."}
{"answers": "Economic inequalities in breast and cervical cancer screening are low in LMICs with high screening coverage. These findings are consistent with the inverse equity hypothesis and indicate that high levels of equity in cancer screening are feasible even in countries with high income inequality.", "prediction_text": "The inverse equity hypothesis does not apply to coverage of cancer screening in middle-income countries. In these countries, economic inequalities in screening participation were substantially lower or non-existent as aggregate coverage increased."}
{"answers": "Post tonsillectomy antibiotics did not prove to have a role in minimizing postoperative morbidity. Moreover, analgesics given on the basis of as required had a limited value.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that postoperative antibiotics did not have a significant role in decreasing post-tonsillectomy morbidity, including pain control, fever, secondary hemorrhage, or reducing hospital stay."}
{"answers": "The study findings suggest that adopting measurement-based care, such as using the PHQ-9, is achievable, even in practices with limited resources.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the systematic use of patient-rated depression severity monitoring through the Nine-Item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) is both helpful and feasible in clinical psychiatry. The study found that all 17 practices adopted the PHQ-9 as a routine part of depression care within a year, and that it influenced clinical decision making for 93% of patient contacts. The use of the PHQ-9 led to treatment changes in 40% of patient contacts, with the most common changes being adjustments to antidepressant medication and the addition of psychotherapy. Additionally, the PHQ-9 led to additional suicide risk"}
{"answers": "There is no advantage to an intramedullary nail versus a sliding compression hip screw for low-energy pertrochanteric fractures AO/OTA 31-A1 and A2, specifically with its increased cost and lack of evidence to show decreased complications or improved patient outcome.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no statistically significant difference between the sliding compression hip screw and intramedullary nail in the treatment of pertrochanteric fractures."}
{"answers": "Just over half the patients in this present cohort may be physically able to undertake some aspects of self-managed foot care, including nail clipping and filing, callus filing and daily hygiene and inspection.", "prediction_text": "The study found that only 57% of the rheumatoid arthritis patients were physically able to participate in the FOOTSTEP self-management foot care program. The main limitations were difficulties with reach and grip strength, with 77% and 67% of patients passing these tests, respectively. Older age, longer disease duration, and higher levels of physical disability, pain, and general health scores were not found to be significant predictors of participation."}
{"answers": "The homogeneity we found in the deprivation-mortality relationship across the regions of Scotland and the absence of a contextualized effect of region highlights the importance of taking a broader strategic policy that can combat the toxic impacts of socio-economic deprivation on health. Focusing on a few specific places (e.g. 15% of the poorest areas) to concentrate resources might be a good start but the impact of socio-economic deprivation on mortality is not restricted to a few places. A comprehensive strategy that can be sustained over time might be needed to interrupt the linkages between poverty and mortality.", "prediction_text": "Yes, context matters for the relationship between deprivation and all-cause mortality. The study found that there are spatial variations in the relationship between deprivation and mortality, with areas in the West of Scotland having higher mortality rates than the rest of the country, even after controlling for deprivation levels. This suggests that local contextual factors may be influencing the relationship between deprivation and mortality."}
{"answers": "This study adds to the growing body of literature documenting the importance of the individual therapist as an important factor in the change process.", "prediction_text": "The study found that approximately 12% of the variability in the outcome of cognitive processing therapy (CPT) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a Veterans Affairs (VA) specialty clinic was due to differences between therapists. The trainer identified several characteristics and actions of effective therapists, including effectively addressing patient avoidance, using flexible interpersonal style, and developing a strong therapeutic alliance. These findings suggest that while there may be some variability in the implementation of evidence-based treatments (EBTs) in practice, therapist characteristics and actions can play a significant role in determining treatment outcomes."}
{"answers": "New depression diagnosis and antidepressant use was shown to be less likely in areas of higher own-ethnic density for some, but not all, ethnic groups.", "prediction_text": "Yes, depression diagnosis and antidepressant prescribing vary by location. Compared to white British patients, black and minority ethnic groups are less likely to be diagnosed with depression or prescribed antidepressants. The relationship between neighbourhood ethnic density and new depression diagnosis is inverse for some groups, with a higher percentage of own-ethnic density associated with a lower odds of depression for Pakistani, Indian, African, and Bangladeshi patients. However, the opposite effect was found for black Caribbean patients."}
{"answers": "These findings suggest a malleable relationship between knee extensor strength, dynamic stability, and disease severity in PD. Although strength is only one piece of the puzzle in the functional outcome of PD, these findings may assist clinicians in designing appropriate interventions aimed at increasing function and decreasing fall risk in PD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant relationship between knee extensor strength, dynamic postural stability, and functional ambulation in patients with Parkinson's disease. Knee extensor strength positively correlated with dynamic postural stability and negatively correlated with disease severity, while dynamic postural stability was negatively correlated with disease severity and positively correlated with functional ambulation. These findings suggest that assessing these parameters may be useful in evaluating and managing Parkinson's disease."}
{"answers": "It is concluded that preloading colloid fluid prior to repositioning could prevent the decrease of systolic blood pressure and central venous pressure during sitting positioning without other complications.", "prediction_text": "Yes, preloading with colloids before positioning neurosurgical patients can prevent hemodynamic changes when they are subsequently changed to the seated position. The study found that systolic blood pressure and central venous pressure were maintained significantly better in the study group compared to the control group after positioning."}
{"answers": "Data from Safe Implementation of Treatments in Stroke-International Stroke Thrombolysis Register suggest that intravenous thrombolysis may modify the observed survival and recovery advantage for men expected in the natural course of an ischemic stroke, with a possible larger beneficial treatment effect in women when compared with men.", "prediction_text": "Yes, sex influences the response to intravenous thrombolysis in ischemic stroke. In this study, men were more likely to have a better functional outcome at 3 months after treatment, while women were more likely to experience symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage and have a higher mortality rate. After adjusting for confounding variables, the male sex was found to be associated with a higher risk of mortality and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, but not with functional outcome."}
{"answers": "The rate of early infection without antibiotic prophylaxis before TIVAD placement in the interventional radiology suite is<1%. Based on these data, use of prophylactic antibiotics for TIVAD placement is not recommended.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, prophylactic antibiotics may not be necessary for totally implantable venous access device (TIVAD) placement by interventional radiologists, as there was no significant difference in the rate of early infection (CLABSI) between patients who received antibiotics incidental to the procedure and those who did not. However, the study did suggest that chemotherapy administration on the day of placement may increase the risk of early infection. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and establish the optimal antibiotic prophylaxis strategy for TIVAD placement."}
{"answers": "The PRP group recorded reduced pain, swelling, and trismus as well as enhanced and faster bone healing compared with those in the control. Hence the study showed that topical application of PRP gel has a beneficial effect in enhancing socket healing after third molar surgery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that the application of autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) gel to the socket of mandibular third molars after surgical extraction can enhance healing. The PRP group had lower postoperative pain scores compared to the control group at all time points, and the scores for lamina dura, trabecular pattern, and bone density were better in the PRP group, although these differences were not statistically significant."}
{"answers": "This study confirms that physicians often differ from patients in the assessment of QoL. This is most likely due to a difference in patient-physician perception of \"significant\" LUTS and clearly demonstrates the importance of patient evaluated QoL in routine clinical assessment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a discrepancy between patient and physician quality of life assessment in women with lower urinary tract dysfunction. The physician underestimated the impact of symptoms on the patient's quality of life in 4 out of 9 domains, and overestimated it in 5 out of 9 domains. This suggests that physicians may not fully appreciate the burden of symptoms on their patients' daily lives."}
{"answers": "Left ventricular dimensions are not influenced by MetS. Rather than MetS, hypertension is primarily responsible for changes in left ventricular dimensions. However, left atrial enlargement is more prominent in patients with MetS, suggesting that each MetS criterion contributes to left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.", "prediction_text": "Yes, accompanying metabolic syndrome contributes to increased heart dimensions in hypertensive patients. The study found significant differences in interventricular septum and posterior wall thickness, left atrial diameter, relative wall thickness, and left ventricular mass between hypertensive patients with and without metabolic syndrome. The only significant difference between the two patient groups was a greater left atrial diameter in patients with metabolic syndrome. Additionally, left atrial diameter was found to be correlated with the number of MetS criteria."}
{"answers": "A higher PV in PMR increases the risk of prolonged steroid therapy and late GCA. Female sex and particular HLA alleles may increase the risk of late GCA. Starting patients on>15 mg prednisolone is associated with a prolonged steroid duration.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the prognosis of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) can be predicted at disease onset. In this study, the following factors were found to be associated with a longer duration of steroid therapy and a higher risk of relapses and late development of giant cell arteritis (GCA):"}
{"answers": "The study suggests that there is no difference in clinical toxicity profiles or survival outcomes with either definitive chemoradiotherapy or chemoradiation followed by surgery in management of locally advanced esophageal cancer.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that surgical resection may not be necessary for patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus who receive chemoradiotherapy. The addition of surgery to chemoradiotherapy did not improve overall survival or disease-free survival in this study. However, the study had limited sample size and follow-up time, so further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Our results give first evidence that lowered beta E during alcohol withdrawal may contribute to anxiety as a common disturbance during this state.", "prediction_text": "The study found that plasma beta-endorphin (beta E) levels were significantly lower in alcoholics during acute alcohol withdrawal compared to healthy controls. Additionally, there was a significant inverse correlation between beta E levels and self-rated anxiety in alcoholics, indicating that lower beta E levels are associated with higher levels of anxiety. However, no association was found between beta E and depression. The study suggests that deficiency in beta E may play a role in the development of anxiety during alcohol withdrawal."}
{"answers": "Increased private health care activity does not reduce the demand for NHS care: NHS and private referral rates were positively associated with each other after adjusting for age, deprivation and practice.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that increased use of private healthcare does not reduce the demand for NHS care. In fact, the opposite is true: areas with higher private sector utilization have higher NHS utilization rates."}
{"answers": "Skewed X-inactivation is not associated with recurrent spontaneous abortion but is associated with increasing maternal age.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, there is no significant association between recurrent spontaneous abortion and skewed X-inactivation. The rate of extreme skewing (90% or greater) in the recurrent spontaneous abortion population was 8.6%, which is not significantly different from any of the other groups, including the primiparous group (1.0%). Additionally, the incidence of X-inactivation skewing of 90% or greater was not different whether there had been at least 1 live birth or no previous live births and at least 3 losses. However, subjects with extreme skewing had a mean age of 2 years older than those without extreme skewing (P"}
{"answers": "Findings suggest that analgesic management of daily pain is better for nursing home residents enrolled in hospice than for those not enrolled in hospice.The prescribing practices portrayed by this study reveal that many dying nursing home residents in daily pain are receiving no analgesic treatment or are receiving analgesic treatment inconsistent with AMDA and other pain management guidelines. Improving the analgesic management of pain in nursing homes is essential if high-quality end-of-life care in nursing homes is to be achieved.", "prediction_text": "Yes, receipt of hospice care in nursing homes improves the management of pain at the end of life. The study found that hospice residents were twice as likely as non-hospice residents to receive regular treatment for daily pain, and a lower proportion of hospice residents received analgesics not recommended by the American Medical Directors Association for managing chronic pain in long-term care settings."}
{"answers": "The continuity-of-care experiences of vascular trainees are suboptimal. This is especially true for postoperative clinic assessment. Same-day admission surgery accounted for most of the cases and was associated with the poorest continuity of care. To provide complete surgical training in an era of changing therapeutic modalities and same-day admission surgery, vascular programs must be creative in structuring training to include adequate ambulatory experience.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the continuity of care experience of residents in an academic vascular department was suboptimal, with only 57% of patients receiving complete in-hospital continuity of care. Emergent cases were associated with a higher rate of preoperative assessment, but elective cases admitted before the day of surgery had higher rates of preoperative assessment and involvement in the decision to operate compared to same-day admission patients. The study suggests that trainees may not be learning complete surgical care."}
{"answers": "Simple detorsion was not accompanied by an increase in morbidity, and all patients studied had functioning ovarian tissue on follow-up despite the surgeon's assessment of the degree of ovarian ischemia. Detorsion is the procedure of choice for most cases of ovarian torsion in children.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that oophorectomy may not be necessary for all children with ovarian torsion, as many ovaries can be treated by detorsion alone. The study found that the median time from presentation to surgery was significantly lower in the detorsion group, and postoperative complications and length of stay were similar between the two groups. Additionally, follow-up sonograms or ovarian biopsies showed normal ovary with follicular development in most cases. Therefore, the study suggests that oophorectomy may not be necessary for all children with ovarian torsion, and detorsion may be a viable alternative."}
{"answers": "Half-dose MR angiography using diluted contrast medium injected at a rate of 1 mL/second depicted the abdominal aorta and its branches as clearly as using a full single dose.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that half-dose contrast-enhanced three-dimensional MR angiography may be sufficient for depicting the abdominal aorta and pelvis, as the signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio of these regions were not significantly different between the half-dose and full-dose groups. However, the study did not find a significant difference in overall image quality across the four groups."}
{"answers": "There was no evidence of a trend in unsafe sex behaviour over time. However, several subgroups were identified as being more likely to report unsafe sex and should be targeted for specific interventions.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no evidence to suggest that unsafe sexual behavior among HIV-infected individuals is increasing over time, based on the data from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study."}
{"answers": "In normal clinical practice, chemotherapy significantly prolongs survival in patients with performance status of less than 2, more time being gained if there is no associated weight loss. We conclude that the reluctance shown by many pneumologists toward using this treatment is not entirely justified.", "prediction_text": "The study found that chemotherapy is an independent predictor of survival in patients with advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), and that patients with ECOG scores of 0 to 1 and absence of weight loss have better survival outcomes with cytostatic treatment. These findings suggest that chemotherapy can be beneficial in improving survival in this patient population, and that pneumologists' skepticism towards chemotherapy may be unwarranted."}
{"answers": "The Medicaid Demonstration in Florida appears to result in lower PMPM expenditures. Demonstration PSNs generated slightly greater reductions in expenditures compared to Demonstration HMOs. PSNs appear to be a promising model for delivering care to Medicaid enrollees.", "prediction_text": "Yes, provider service networks (PSNs) in Florida's Medicaid program resulted in lower expenditures compared to HMOs. Specifically, among Supplemental Security Income (SSI) enrollees, PMPM expenditures were $7 lower among PSNs compared to HMOs. Similarly, among Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) enrollees, PMPM expenditures were lower among PSNs compared to HMOs, although to a lesser extent."}
{"answers": "In this series, in accordance to available testosterone, the prevalence of PADAM was determined to be high, in which the ADAM questionnaire rendered a low diagnostic efficiency. PADAM diagnosis could be clinically suspected when symptoms of sexual dysfunction are present.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the ADAM questionnaire is useful for the screening of partial androgenic deficiency of aging men. The study found that the ADAM questionnaire had a sensitivity of 83.3% and specificity of 19.7% in detecting PADAM, and item 1 (decreased sexual desire) was a better predictor of hypogonadism than the complete questionnaire."}
{"answers": "We found that intrapartum VAS was an effective predictor of fetal acidosis in cases of FHR variable decelerations, but its predictability for fetal acidosis in cases of FHR late decelerations was limited. Both VAS and fetal blood pH are good predictors of neonatal morbidity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that intrapartum vibroacoustic stimulation (VAS) is an effective predictor of fetal acidosis during labor. The study found that a negative response to VAS (no acceleration or decelerations) was associated with a low fetal blood pH (pH<7.20) in both term and preterm fetuses. The study also found that the positive predictive value of fetal acidosis was higher when VAS was used alone compared to when fetal heart rate (FHR) variable decelerations or late decelerations were used alone. Additionally, the study found that both a negative VAS response and fetal acidosis had equal"}
{"answers": "Emergency US fellowship programs had a positive impact on residents' US educational experiences. Emergency medicine residents performed more scans overall and also used bedside US for more advanced applications in programs with EUS fellowships.", "prediction_text": "Yes, emergency ultrasound fellowship programs have a significant impact on emergency medicine residents' ultrasound education. Residents in programs with fellowships performed more scans and had a broader scope of bedside ultrasound applications compared to those in programs without fellowships. Additionally, there were differences in barriers to ultrasound education and factors that impact residents' ultrasound education between the two groups."}
{"answers": "Obesity does not seem to impact the severity of injury, mortality rate, types of injury, and procedure outcomes in children. Obese patients are more likely to have rib and pelvic injuries.", "prediction_text": "Yes, obesity has a significant impact on the pattern and outcome of trauma in children. Obese children are more likely to have older age, higher injury severity score, lower pediatric trauma score, lower heart rate, and lower respiratory rate compared to non-obese children. They are also more likely to have rib fractures and pelvic injuries. However, there is no significant association between mortality and obesity."}
{"answers": "The laparoscopic-assisted approach to Crohn's disease is feasible and safe with good outcomes. Co-morbid preoperative findings such as abscess, phlegmon, or recurrent disease at the previous ileocolic anastomosis are not contraindications to a successful laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resection in select patients.", "prediction_text": "No, these factors are not contraindications to a successful laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resection. In fact, the study found that operative blood loss and time were greater in the group that had open ileocolic resections (group IV) compared to the groups that had laparoscopic-assisted resections (groups I, II, and III). Additionally, morbidity was highest in group IV and only one patient died in this group, while there were no deaths in the laparoscopic groups. The length of hospital stay was also longest in group IV. These findings suggest that laparoscopic-assisted ileoc"}
{"answers": "When controlling for preoperative features, the year in which RP was performed is a predictor of outcome on multivariate analysis. This effect could not be explained by stage migration.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the year in which radical prostatectomy (RP) was performed is a predictor of treatment outcome in prostate cancer, with better outcomes observed in patients who underwent surgery later in the study period (mid-1990s)."}
{"answers": "The menopausal transition warrants attention as a period of vulnerability to MDD recurrence, while health factors and VMS should be considered important risk factors for first lifetime-onset of MDD during midlife.", "prediction_text": "The study found that women without a prior history of major depression (MDD) had a lower risk of developing MDD during midlife compared to those with a prior history, and their risk profiles differed. Specifically, health conditions prior to baseline and during follow-ups, perception of functioning, and vasomotor symptoms (VMS) were risk factors for first lifetime-onset MDD, while being peri- and post-menopausal, psychological symptoms, and a prior anxiety disorder were predominant risk factors for MDD recurrence."}
{"answers": "Most children undergoing congenital heart surgery can be extubated in the operating room. Most neonates, including many undergoing complex procedures, can be extubated within the first 24 hours after surgery. Early extubation was associated with low morbidity rates and short lengths of intensive care unit and hospital stays.", "prediction_text": "Yes, early extubation (within 24 hours) should be the goal for children after congenital cardiac surgery. The study found that early extubation was associated with lower mortality and a lower rate of reintubation compared to delayed extubation. Additionally, early extubation was achieved in the majority of patients, including neonates, and was not associated with increased complications or longer hospital stays."}
{"answers": "A significant association between farming and PSV has been identified for the first time. Results also support previously reported associations with silica, solvents, and allergy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, environmental factors are important in primary systemic vasculitis (PSV). The study found significant associations between PSV and several environmental factors, including farming in the index year and during working lifetime, high occupational silica and solvent exposure in the index year and during working lifetime, drug allergy, and overall allergy. These findings suggest that environmental exposures may play a role in the development of PSV."}
{"answers": "This study that shows that adequate femoral tunnel lengths can be safely created without knee hyperflex - ion using flexible instruments via an anteromedial portal.", "prediction_text": "The study found that flexible instruments can create femoral tunnel lengths greater than 20 mm at 90\u00b0 of knee flexion, which is the angle typically used in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. However, the distance to important lateral structures, such as the common peroneal nerve, varies with knee flexion angle. At 90\u00b0 of flexion, there was a trend towards longer distances to the common peroneal nerve, but no significant differences were found among the groups. Therefore, it is possible to create adequate femoral tunnel lengths using flexible instruments in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction at 90\u00b0 of knee flexion, but careful dis"}
{"answers": "A proportionally longer treatment duration was identified as an adverse factor in low-risk patients. Treatment breaks resulting in a NTDR of>/=33% (e.g., four or more breaks during a 40-fraction treatment, 5 d/wk) should be avoided.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the duration of radiotherapy (RT) treatment for prostate cancer is significantly associated with the outcome, with longer treatment duration being associated with a higher risk of recurrence. Specifically, the 10-year freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF) rate was higher for patients with a lower number of nontreatment days (NTDR) during RT. The NTDR was independently predictive of FFBF, along with other factors such as T stage, initial prostate-specific antigen level, and radiation dose."}
{"answers": "TEE allowed a diagnosis of site involvement that did correlate with the anatomic diagnosis obtained during the operation. This fact contributed to the management of patients and was of great help in guiding the surgical intervention. Echo-oriented single-valve replacement may be a safe strategy for patients with PVE and double prostheses.", "prediction_text": "Single-valve replacement in patients with double prostheses may not be safe, as 4 out of 13 patients who underwent this procedure died within a week after surgery. However, the study found that the positive predictive value of transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) for the preoperative diagnosis of the site of infection was 100%, suggesting that accurate diagnosis is possible."}
{"answers": "Acute hepatitis C in the post universal blood products screening era was found to be predominantly an iatrogenic disease in the investigated localities. This finding should direct attention and resources towards the development and implementation of preventive measures.", "prediction_text": "Yes, according to the study, acute hepatitis C in Israel is predominantly transmitted via iatrogenic means, such as medical procedures and clinical settings, rather than through injecting drug use."}
{"answers": "Our results suggest a protective effect of breast-feeding among children with a family history of atopy that is not confined to the period of breast-feeding but continues during the first three years of life. Breast-feeding should be promoted in children with a family history of atopy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, our study found that breast-feeding is associated with lower levels of childhood illness in children with a family history of atopy. Breast-fed children had fewer episodes of gastroenteritis, lower respiratory tract infections, and digestive tract disorders in the first year of life, and fewer respiratory tract infections and skin infections over the next three years of life."}
{"answers": "Transrectal ultrasound guided and fusion biopsy cancer detection rates decreased with increasing prostate volume. However, magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy had a higher prostate cancer detection rate compared to that of transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy in the literature. Magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy represents a promising solution for patients with suspicion of prostate cancer and an enlarged prostate.", "prediction_text": "Yes, magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy can improve cancer detection in enlarged prostates. The overall detection rate of the magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion platform was 55%, and the detection rate was significantly higher for prostates less than 40 cc (71.1%). Multivariable logistic regression showed an inverse association between magnetic resonance imaging volume and prostate cancer detection, controlling for age and prostate specific antigen."}
{"answers": "There is no difference in postoperative morbidity, rates of rehospitalization, in-patient mortality or hospitalization costs in geriatric patients undergoing regional or general anesthesia for repair of hip fracture. Delay in surgery beyond 3 days and ICU admission both increase cost of hospitalization.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no significant difference in morbidity, mortality, or hospitalization costs between patients who received regional anesthesia and those who received general anesthesia for surgery in geriatric patients with hip fracture."}
{"answers": "Mesocolon invasion should be included in T4 for the staging of gastric cancer.", "prediction_text": "Yes, based on the findings of this study, direct mesocolon invasion should be included in the T4 category for the staging of gastric cancer. The study found that patients with mesocolon invasion had significantly worse curability, nodal metastasis, and survival compared to those without invasion, and that the survival of patients after curative resection was better than those with incurable factors. Therefore, including direct mesocolon invasion in the T4 category would provide a more accurate reflection of the severity of the disease and help guide treatment decisions."}
{"answers": "Genetic variants identified in the present study may be insufficient to promote early carotid atherosclerosis.", "prediction_text": "No, mutations causing low HDL-C do not promote increased carotid intima-media thickness, as measured by cIMT, in individuals with genetic HDL deficiency states."}
{"answers": "The Turkish version of the EQ-5D-based utility score seems to be a valid instrument in the assessment of quality of life studies in patients with acute coronary syndrome.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the Turkish version of the EQ-5D appears to be a valid quality of life instrument in patients with acute coronary syndrome. The study found a significant correlation between the EQ-5D index score and the MacNew subscales, and the EQ-5D index score was found to be significantly associated with the MacNew global score in a stepwise regression model. These findings suggest that the EQ-5D is able to measure quality of life in patients with acute coronary syndrome and is a valid instrument for this population."}
{"answers": "We found an improved survival associated with cardiologist care and a mixture of general practitioner and cardiologist care compared with general practitioner care. The pattern of outpatient care may therefore be important for the survival of patients with CHF.", "prediction_text": "Yes, specialty care (cardiology) is associated with improved survival of patients with congestive heart failure. Compared to patients who received general medicine care only, patients who received both general medicine and cardiology care (MIXED group) had the lowest mortality rate. The risk of death was higher in patients who received only general medicine care (GM-only) or neither general medicine nor cardiology care (no-GM/CARD)."}
{"answers": "Comparison of mother-offspring and father-offspring associations for BMI suggests that intergenerational acceleration mechanisms do not make an important contribution to levels of childhood BMI within the population. Associations at later ages and for different components of body composition now require study.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is evidence to suggest that there is an intrauterine influence on obesity. The study found that the association between maternal BMI and offspring BMI was similar to the association between paternal BMI and offspring BMI, suggesting that the intrauterine environment plays a role in the development of obesity. Additionally, the study found that the association between high parental BMI (in the top decile) and offspring BMI was similar for both parents, further supporting the idea that there is an intrauterine influence on obesity."}
{"answers": "TEE is useful to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors. An FAC less than 50% is present in 36% of potential heart donors. Because left ventricular dysfunction is often reversible shortly after transplantation, an FAC below 50% may not necessarily preclude the use of hearts for transplantation.", "prediction_text": "The study found that transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) can be used to assess left ventricular function in brain-dead donors and can help identify hearts that are suitable for transplantation. Of the 55 potential donors evaluated, 20 had an echocardiographic fractional area change (FAC) of less than 50%, indicating poor left ventricular function. Of the 40 hearts harvested, 36 were successfully transplanted, and the FAC increased significantly from 51% to 57% in the recipients. The study suggests that marginally acceptable hearts may be suitable for transplantation, but further research"}
{"answers": "Pediatricians should be alert to the earliest manifestations of AEA. Awareness of choking games among the young and, of those, a subset who eventually progress to potentially fatal AEA is strongly encouraged among all primary care professionals who may be able to interrupt the behavior.", "prediction_text": "Yes, autoerotic asphyxiation (AEA) is a dangerous and potentially lethal practice that can lead to unintended death. Despite its prevalence among children, preteens, and adolescents, it is often kept secret and can be difficult to identify. Pediatricians can play a crucial role in identifying and addressing this issue by demonstrating a willingness to discuss concerns, ameliorating distress, and possibly preventing a tragedy. The study highlights the importance of increasing awareness among pediatricians and other healthcare professionals about the typical onset and characteristics of AEA, as well as the potential etiology and intervention"}
{"answers": "The whole-body MRI protocol for the detection of bone metastases could safely be limited to the T1w sequence in adults, especially at 3 T. There is no need for an additional STIR sequence. These initial results will have a major impact on the department's workflow if confirmed by larger studies as they will help reduce examination time and therefore save financial resources.", "prediction_text": "No, STIR imaging cannot be omitted for the diagnosis of bone metastases at 1.5 T and 3 T. The study found that T1-weighted (T1w) sequences had a higher sensitivity and better lesion conspicuity, delineation, and image quality compared to STIR sequences for the detection of bone metastases. In fact, STIR imaging detected fewer bone metastases in comparison with T1w imaging in 53% of patients at 3 T and 37.5% of patients at 1.5 T. Therefore, STIR imaging should not be relied upon as the sole modality for the diagn"}
{"answers": "This study found that there was poor agreement between the AD's decision and the subsequent MR's decision regarding the fitness of those seafarers who decided to appeal against the AD's initial assessment. The reasons for this are considered.", "prediction_text": "No, the approved doctors (ADs) and medical referees (MRs) in the UK do not agree when assessing a seafarer's fitness. The study found that the ADs and MRs had poor agreement (Kappa K = 0.18) in their assessments, with the MRs more likely to classify seafarers as fit with restrictions than the ADs. The reasons for these differences include factors such as the experience and knowledge of the MRs, and their different interpretation of the standards."}
{"answers": "In our study, we suggest that glomerular hyperfiltration due to pregnancy does not have adverse effects on kidney in women with more parities. Pregnancy may have possible protective mechanisms for kidney against adverse effects of glomerular hyperfiltration.", "prediction_text": "Yes, glomerular hyperfiltration in pregnancy can damage the kidney in women with more parities. The study found that women with four or more parities had significantly higher GFR values compared to those with no or one parity, indicating that the kidneys were working harder and potentially leading to damage."}
{"answers": "Implant coating with an antibacterial-loaded hydrogel reduces bacterial colonization and biofilm formation in vitro.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that coating implants with a fast-resorbable hydrogel loaded with antibacterial compounds in vitro reduced bacterial colonization and biofilm formation."}
{"answers": "Location of death varies by country of birth. BAME groups are more likely to die in a hospital and less likely to die at home or in a hospice. Further investigation is needed to determine whether these differences result from patient-centred preferences, or other environment or service-related factors. This knowledge will enable strategies to be developed to improve access to relevant palliative care and related services, where necessary.", "prediction_text": "Yes, ethnicity affects where people with cancer die. The study found that decedents from certain ethnic groups were more likely to die in hospitals, while others were more likely to die at home. For example, those born in Asia and Africa were more likely to die in hospitals, while those born in the Caribbean were less likely to die at home. These findings suggest that there are disparities in end-of-life care for different ethnic groups, and that further research is needed to understand and address these disparities."}
{"answers": "Overall, 7% of women in our cohort met either clinical or molecular criteria for Lynch syndrome. All of these women had a prior history or a first-degree relative with an HNPCC-associated cancer. Limiting genetic evaluation to women with synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancer who have a family history suggestive of HNPCC may appropriately identify women with Lynch syndrome.", "prediction_text": "Of the 59 patients with tumor blocks available for analysis, 2 met the Amsterdam criteria for HNPCC and 5 had molecular findings consistent with a germline mutation of either MSH2 or MLH1, indicating a likelihood of Lynch syndrome."}
{"answers": "CMV-IgM and IgG antibodies assessment was not a potential discriminative test to identify congenitally infected newborns. In addition, low birth weight and small head circumference at birth failed to predict congenital CMV infection. CMV-DNA detection in umbilical cord blood at the time of delivery using real-time PCR of all newborns is recommended as decisive, rapid and non-invasive test.", "prediction_text": "Yes, low birth weight is a risk indicator for congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. The study found that newborns with birth weights below 2700 grams or head circumferences below 32 cm were more likely to have CMV DNAemia, indicating congenital CMV infection."}
{"answers": "The use of instrumental variables allowed us to demonstrate a significant relationship between better ambulatory process of care and better health-related quality of life. This finding underscores the importance of efforts to improve the process of care.", "prediction_text": "Yes, our study found that better ambulatory process of care is associated with better health-related quality of life outcomes for patients with chronic disease. Specifically, we found that patients who received better process of care had smaller declines in health-related quality of life scores over a 30-month observation window. This association remained significant after adjusting for the burden of illness."}
{"answers": "To date, the newly developed Singapore equation is the most accurate BMR prediction equation in Chinese and is applicable for use in a large BMI range including those overweight and obese.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the currently used prediction equations for basal metabolic rate (BMR) in Chinese adults are not applicable for a large body mass index (BMI) range. A new prediction equation was developed using a sample of 121 men and 111 women in China, and it showed better accuracy compared to existing equations. The new equation is: BMR (kJ/d) = 52.6 x weight (kg) + 828 x gender + 1960 (women = 0, men = 1). The accuracy rate of this equation was 78% for the whole range of BMI and 80% for BMI greater than"}
{"answers": "This preliminary study demonstrated that OSCE ratings by LEs and REs were reasonably comparable when using checklists. Remote examination may be a feasible and acceptable way of assessing students' clinical skills, but further validity evidence will be required before it can be recommended for use in high-stakes examinations.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that remote physician-examiners can replace on-site physician-examiners in an OSCE. The study showed statistically significant correlations between local examiners (LEs) and remote examiners (REs) in assessing student performance at various stations, including history taking, physical examination, and management. While there were some variations in correlations between LE and RE global ratings, the overall acceptance of the remote examination method was high among both examiners and students."}
{"answers": "ACR is an independent prognostic factor for maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes in suspected preeclampsia. ACR may be useful to inform risk predictions within a prognostic model.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the first urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) in women with suspected preeclampsia is a prognostic factor for both maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes. The study found that a higher ACR was associated with an increased odds of adverse maternal and neonatal composite outcomes, as well as with reduced gestational age at delivery, in a multivariate analysis adjusting for existing prognostic factors."}
{"answers": "The effect on venous pressures caused by the change in patient positioning alone during liver surgery does not affect the risk of venous air embolism.", "prediction_text": "No, the position of the patient during liver surgery does not seem to influence the risk of venous air embolism, as there was no pressure gradient between the hepatic and central venous levels in any of the positions tested."}
{"answers": "The observations from this study provide limited support for the possibility that occupational arsenic exposure could play a role in the development of diabetes mellitus. Many other metallic compounds are also used in art glass production, however, and there is a possibility of confounding.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found an increased risk of diabetes mellitus among Swedish art glass workers, particularly among those who were exposed to arsenic in their work. The odds ratio for diabetes mellitus among glassworks employees was 1.2, with a higher risk observed among glassblowers, other foundry workers, and unspecified glassworkers who were probably exposed to arsenic."}
{"answers": "Hospital preparedness can be better defined by a fixed number of casualties rather than a percentile of its bed capacity. Only 20% of the arriving casualties will require immediate medical treatment. Implementation of this concept may improve the utilisation of national emergency health resources both in the preparation phase and on real time.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the current readiness guidelines based on the 20% bed capacity rule may not accurately predict the surge capacity needed for terrorism-related multiple casualty incidents in Israeli hospitals. The study suggests that the actual number of casualties requiring immediate medical treatment may be lower than expected, with 79.2% of casualties not necessitating immediate medical attention based on severity scores and emergency department discharges. The study also found that the mean number of arriving casualties to a single hospital was 20.8+/-13.3, with a range of 4-56 and a median of 16.5"}
{"answers": "While Italian primary care physicians appropriately target eradication therapy for H pylori infection in patients with peptic ulcer disease rather than nonulcer disease, the intervention was still underused in these patients. Improvements in this prescribing behavior are needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that primary care physicians underprescribe antibiotics for peptic ulcer disease (PUD). Of the 6866 patients seen by primary care physicians, only 690 (10%) received eradication therapy, with a significantly lower proportion of patients with PUD (27.6%) compared to non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD) (2%). Additionally, there was a significant difference in the frequency of eradication therapy between patients with a definitive diagnosis of PUD (37.7%) and those with a presumptive diagnosis (20.3%)."}
{"answers": "When cerebral hemispherectomy is performed to control seizures associated with very early (in utero) insult, it has been found that the remaining right hemisphere is still able to support reading and phonological processing skills that are normally mediated by the left hemisphere. Our results also suggest the existence of variability in individuals after hemispherectomy, even within groups having the same etiology and similar timing of insult.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the isolated right hemisphere can read to some extent. In this study, 60% of the participants developed average-range word reading and paragraph reading skills, despite the fact that the left hemisphere was removed. Phonological awareness and nonword reading skills were spared in the majority of participants, and phonological awareness levels strongly correlated with word reading skills. Additionally, verbal memory and receptive vocabulary size were found to positively correlate with reading levels, similar to those reported in average readers."}
{"answers": "Improved office-based practices regarding influenza vaccination could significantly impact Healthy People 2020 goals by increasing influenza vaccine uptake and reducing corresponding racial and ethnic disparities.", "prediction_text": "Yes, routine offering of influenza vaccination in office-based settings can reduce racial and ethnic disparities in adult influenza vaccination. Eliminating \"missed opportunities\" for vaccination in these settings could cut racial and ethnic disparities in vaccination by roughly half."}
{"answers": "The SPI was accurate in predicting the presence or absence of esophageal varices in patients with compensated cirrhosis.", "prediction_text": "Yes, non-invasive diagnosis of esophageal varices in patients with compensated hepatic cirrhosis is possible by duplex Doppler ultrasonography. The study found that the splenic portal index (SPI) was the most accurate parameter for predicting the presence of esophageal varices, with a cut-off value of SPI <5.0 offering the highest diagnostic accuracy. Of the 28 patients with SPI <5.0, 27 had no esophageal varices, with a negative predictive value of 96% and sensitivity of 96%. Of the remaining 28 patients with SPI \u2265"}
{"answers": "This study showed for the first time that RALP induces lower tissue trauma than RRP.", "prediction_text": "Yes, robotically assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) is less invasive than retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP) based on the levels of inflammatory markers (IL-6 and CRP) and lactate in the blood samples collected during and after the surgery. The levels of these markers were higher in the RRP group at various time points after surgery, indicating more tissue damage and inflammation in the RRP group."}
{"answers": "The researchers studied a defined skin care protocol using a cleanser with aloe vera and a cleansing lotion, followed by application of either a moisture barrier with silicone or skin protectant with zinc oxide and menthol, undertaken at two different frequencies. Data revealed the incidence of moderate IAD was decreased in the experimental group (receiving the skin protocol every 6 hours and p.r.n.).", "prediction_text": "Yes, the incidence and severity of incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) were significantly reduced in critically ill patients who received a defined skin care protocol every 6 hours compared to every 12 hours. The dermatitis score in the intervention group was significantly lower (7.1%) than in the control group (10.9%) on discharge."}
{"answers": "Patient coaching offers promise as a means of reducing racial/ethnic disparities in pain control. Larger studies are needed to validate these findings and to explore possible mechanisms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patient coaching can reduce racial/ethnic disparities in cancer pain control. The intervention in this study eliminated disparities in average pain levels between minority and white patients at the 2-week follow-up."}
{"answers": "The association between plasma glucose levels and CVD risk is mainly explained by insulin resistance, which raises the question of whether glucose lowering per se without changes in the processes that underlie hyperglycemia should be the sole clinical paradigm in the treatment of type 2 diabetes or its prevention.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that insulin resistance drives the association between hyperglycemia and cardiovascular risk. The association between fasting plasma glucose and cardiovascular risk was only significant after adjusting for insulin sensitivity, and the association between 2-hour plasma glucose and cardiovascular risk disappeared after adjusting for insulin sensitivity and fasting plasma glucose. Similarly, insulin sensitivity was still associated with cardiovascular risk after adjusting for glucose levels. These findings suggest that insulin resistance is a key factor in the relationship between hyperglycemia and cardiovascular risk."}
{"answers": "Tracheobronchoscopy is a useful and safe procedure and should be recommended in tertiary centers for babies with EA before surgical repair.", "prediction_text": "Yes, preoperative tracheobronchoscopy (TBS) can be clinically useful in newborns with esophageal atresia (EA). The study found that TBS helped identify unsuspected fistulas and malformations of the respiratory tree in 28% of the patients, including 15% of the infants. TBS also modified the surgical approach in 24% of the patients. The study suggests that TBS can be a valuable tool in the management of EA."}
{"answers": "The recently released seventh edition of the primary tumor staging system for kidney tumors is a powerful predictor of CSS. However, some of the substages identified by the classification have overlapping prognoses, and other substages include patients with heterogeneous outcomes. The few modifications included in this edition may have not resolved the most critical issues in the previous version.", "prediction_text": "The study validated the 2009 TNM version for primary tumor classification in kidney cancer, but found that the substratification of pT1 tumors did not retain an independent predictive role. The study also found that the novel classification of the primary tumor was a powerful independent predictor of cancer-specific survival (CSS) in multivariable analysis. However, the study had limitations such as retrospective design, lack of central pathologic review, and small number of patients included in some substages. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "The Young-Burgess system is useful for predicting transfusion requirements. For the system to predict mortality or nonorthopaedic injuries, fractures must be divided into stable (APC1, LC1) and unstable (APC2, APC3, LC2, LC3, VS, combined mechanism of injury) types. LC1 injuries are very common and not always benign (overall mortality rate, 8.2%).", "prediction_text": "Yes, the Young-Burgess classification system was found to predict mortality, transfusion requirements, and non-orthopaedic injuries in patients with pelvic ring fractures. The study found that the system was able to differentiate between different types of fractures based on their severity and predict the likelihood of certain outcomes, such as transfusion requirements and non-orthopaedic injuries. However, the system was not found to be highly accurate in predicting mortality, with a P value of 0.07."}
{"answers": "Parity is not directly linked to insulin sensitivity deterioration, to CP/FPG increase during pregnancy, or to GDM appearance, although it is linked through the mediation of progressive ageing and weight gain either before or during pregnancy, when there is a sufficiently long time interval between pregnancies.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, parity (number of births) is associated with decreased insulin sensitivity index (ISI(OGTT)) and increased basal plasma C peptide/fasting plasma glucose (CP/FPG) in women with parity >3. Additionally, parity is linearly related to the risk of gestational diabetes (GDM), with the strongest association observed in women aged 35-40 years. However, after adjusting for age, pregestational body mass index (BMI), and weight gain, the relationships between parity and ISI(OGTT), CP/FPG, and GDM become non-signific"}
{"answers": "The relationship between cognitive functioning and recognition of frequency compressed speech-in-noise was not statistically significant. The findings may have been different if the participants had been provided with training and/or time to 'acclimatize' to the frequency-compressed conditions.", "prediction_text": "Yes, cognitive function predicts frequency-compressed speech recognition in listeners with normal hearing and normal cognition. There was a statistically significant relationship between speech recognition and cognition for the unprocessed condition but not for the frequency-compressed conditions."}
{"answers": "We conclude that beta1Gly49 homozygosity and TACC haplotype of ADRB2 gene, both loss-of-function genetic variations, may predispose to TTN.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is evidence to suggest that polymorphisms in the beta-adrenergic receptor (ADRB) encoding genes, specifically the ADRB2 gene, may play a role in the development of transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN). The study found that newborns with TTN were more likely to be homozygous for the beta1Gly49 allele, which was associated with an increased risk of TTN. Additionally, a haplotype consisting of the T-47C, A46G, C79G, and C491T alleles in the ADRB2 gene was found to be significantly associated"}
{"answers": "MSWM does not appear to confer additional benefit as compared to the standard preoperative bariatric surgery protocol in terms of weight loss and most behavioral outcomes after LAGB in our patient population.", "prediction_text": "No, participation in a preoperative medically supervised weight loss program (MSWM) did not improve weight loss outcomes after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) in a publicly insured population. In fact, the study found that participants in the MSWM program had a lower level of physical activity compared to those in the usual care group postoperatively."}
{"answers": "TAVI can be performed safely without balloon predilatation and with the same early results as achieved with the standard procedure including balloon predilatation. The reduction in the number of pacing periods required may be beneficial for the patient.", "prediction_text": "The study found that omitting balloon predilatation in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVI) does not result in significant differences in early hemodynamic results or complication rates compared to the standard procedure with predilatation. Therefore, the study suggests that predilatation may not be necessary in TAVI."}
{"answers": "In our study; sex is not a significant predictor of recanalization rate, time to recanalization or 3-month outcome in stroke patients following IV rt-PA.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no significant difference in the effectiveness of rt-PA between men and women in acute stroke patients."}
{"answers": "Serum sample might be alternatively used in the difficult time of getting tumor tissue for analyzing the status of EGFR mutation status in patients with advanced NSCLC.", "prediction_text": "Yes, serum can be used for analyzing the EGFR mutation status in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study found that EGFR mutations were detected in the serum samples of 11 patients and in the tumor samples of 12 patients, with a high correlation between the mutations detected in serum and tumor samples (87.7%). Additionally, the response to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors was significantly associated with EGFR mutations in both tumor samples and serum samples. These findings suggest that serum can be used as an alternative source of tissue for analyzing EGFR mutations in patients with"}
{"answers": "Although the provision of high-quality evidence-based resources, electronic or otherwise, is essential for standardizing care and improving patient outcomes, the authors' findings demonstrate that this alone does not ensure uptake. It is important to understand end-users, the environment in which they operate, and the basic infrastructure required to implement such a system. Implementation must also be accompanied by continuing education and endorsement to ensure both long-term sustainability and use of the system to its full potential.", "prediction_text": "The use of Web-based systems in medical oncology is promising, but its adoption and use vary depending on factors such as hospital location, clinician roles, experience, and attitudes. While the Web-based system can play a major role in guiding oncology treatment, clinicians' autonomy and perceptions of lack of time can hinder its use. Education and hospital policy are also important factors in ensuring the system's ongoing use."}
{"answers": "This study has shown that being SGA was not a significant risk factor for any stage ROP or for severe ROP in this cohort and, also, that the risk factors for ROP were similar among SGA and AGA very-low-birth-weight preterm babies.", "prediction_text": "Yes, being small for gestational age (SGA) is a risk factor for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). The study found that preterm infants born SGA were more likely to develop ROP than those born appropriate for gestational age (AGA)."}

The study found that the cumulative primary patency was 60.3% at 1 year and 48.4% at 3 years, and the limb salvage rate was 68.6% at 1 and at 3 years."}
{"answers": "Although the SLBM is quite repeatable, it underestimates mesopic pupil size and shows a too wide range of agreement with CIP. SLBM shows low sensitivity in detecting pupils larger than 6\u00a0mm, which may be misleading when planning anterior segment surgery. Previous grading-consensus training strategies may increase interrater reproducibility, and compensation for the systematic underestimation could improve accuracy of the SLBM.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the cobalt blue light slit-lamp biomicroscopy method (SLBM) can be used to measure mesopic pupil size. The study you provided shows that SLBM can accurately measure pupil diameter, including in the mesopic range (pupil sizes greater than 6.0 mm). The method has good intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility, with a high level of agreement between examiners. However, the sensitivity and specificity of SLBM for detecting pupils larger than 6 mm were lower than those reported for other methods, such as Colvard infrared pupillometry (CIP). The best trade-"}

{"answers": "There was little evidence that people at high risk of falls received systematic falls risk assessment during rehabilitation. When a risk was identified, generally a strategy was implemented. However, failure to assess some risk factors might have limited fall prevention strategies offered. Failure to adequately address risks during hospitalization could contribute to falls post-discharge. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2016; 16: 570-576.", "prediction_text": "The study found that discharge documentation did not accurately identify falls risk for most patients, and there was limited assessment of falls risk factors and implementation of fall prevention strategies. Only 9 out of 50 patients had their falls risk correctly identified in their discharge documentation. Additionally, patients at high falls risk had a median of 8 falls risk factors, but there was limited assessment of osteoporosis, footwear, and visual assessment in the previous 2 years. Finally, patients received a median of 6.5 out of 16 possible fall prevention strategies, with the most common strategies being mobility, strength, and Personal Activity of Daily Living training. Overall, the"}
{"answers": "Although most Medicare beneficiaries who received a new CIED between 2005 and 2009 did not have an initial in-person CIED follow-up visit within 2 to 12 weeks after device implantation, the rate of initial follow-up improved appreciably over time. This CIED follow-up visit was significantly more common in white patients than in patients of other races.", "prediction_text": "The study found that there is a significant variation in the frequency of follow-up visits for patients with new cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) based on patient factors and year of device implantation. While the 2008 expert consensus statement recommended a minimum frequency of follow-up, the study found that only a minority of eligible patients had an in-person visit within the recommended time frames. Specifically, 42.4% of eligible patients had an initial in-person visit within 2 to 12 weeks, and 65.1% had a visit within 0 to 16 weeks. However, there was an improvement in follow"}
{"answers": "According to our study, there is a great variability when different brands and models of scanners are compared directly. Furthermore, the CT scan analysis and HU evaluation appears to gather insufficient information in order to characterize and identify the composition of renal stones.", "prediction_text": "There are significant differences in the mean CT attenuation values obtained with different CT scanner models, which can lead to pitfalls in urinary stone identification based on CT attenuation values. The study found that some stone types had mean CT attenuation values that were significantly different between scanner models, and that the Philips Brilliance model had mean values that were equal to those obtained with the Siemens Sensation and Toshiba Aquilion models. These findings suggest that the same information may not be obtained on different scanner models, which could lead to misclassification of urinary stones."}
{"answers": "Ophthalmic pathology and basic science research show that SBK and ASA are improvements in excimer laser keratorefractive surgery compared to conventional LASIK or PRK, particularly with regard to maintaining corneal biomechanics and perhaps moderately reducing the risk of corneal haze. However, most of the disadvantages caused by wound healing issues remain.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there are differences in the biomechanical and wound healing characteristics of corneas after excimer laser keratorefractive surgery between advanced surface ablation (ASA) and sub-Bowman's keratomileusis (SBK). The study found that ASA resulted in stronger and more rigid corneas, particularly in the anterior and peripheral regions, which may make it biomechanically safer than SBK for reducing the risk of keratectasia. However, both techniques still have some disadvantages due to inadequate reparative wound healing in the adult human corneal stroma."}
{"answers": "The Internet would be a practical and accessible way of delivering sexual health education to young people, particularly if it is incorporated into activities and websites they enjoy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the Internet can be used to improve sexual health awareness in web-wise young people. According to the study, 62.4% of participants said they would use a GUM website, and a \"question line\" where they could e-mail questions to a health care professional was found to be of interest to 70.4% of participants. These findings suggest that young people are willing to use the Internet for sexual health information and support."}
{"answers": "Ultrasound not only has comparable sensitivity to that of X-ray for the identification of limb fractures but is also equally effective for the diagnosis of fracture type and dislocation. Thus, ultrasound can be used as an adequate alternative method to X-ray for pediatric fracture diagnosis.", "prediction_text": "No, ultrasound is not equal to X-ray in pediatric fracture diagnosis. While X-ray had some advantages in detecting fracture type, ultrasound was superior in identifying dislocations. However, the findings were not statistically significant after adjusting for multiple testing."}
{"answers": "Although initial infection control rate was substantially lower in the retention group than the removal group, final results were comparable at latest followup. We believe retention treatment can be selectively considered for non-S. aureus infection, and when applied in selected patients, polyethylene exchange should be performed.", "prediction_text": "Based on the study, implant retention may not be recommended for the treatment of infected TKA. While the infection control rate was lower in the retention group compared to the removal group, the difference was not statistically significant. Additionally, the retention group had a shorter treatment duration, but there was no difference in the number of additional surgeries and length of hospital stay. The only factor associated with infection control was the type of treatment (retention versus removal), with Staphylococcus aureus infection and polyethylene nonexchange as contributing factors for failure of infection control in the retention group."}
{"answers": "The observed socioeconomic, demographic and microbiological differences between unmarried and married women could be responsible for the poor pregnancy outcome among unmarried pregnant women in Poland. Unmarried pregnant women should be covered by comprehensive medical care even before pregnancy. Further studies taking into account the role of psychological stress, patterns of sexual behavior and substance abuse during pregnancy could help identify the factors responsible for adverse pregnancy outcome among unmarried pregnant women.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that unmarried pregnant women in Poland were at a higher risk of developing bacterial vaginosis (BV) and certain pathological microflora, such as Mycoplasma hominis, compared to married women. The study also found that the young age of the subject and a low concentration of Lactobacillus spp. were independent risk factors for M. hominis. These findings suggest that microbiological factors may play a role in the poor pregnancy outcome observed among unmarried pregnant women in Poland."}
{"answers": "In conclusion, concept mapping has a positive effect on students' academic achievement. These findings could provide valuable evidence for establishing concept mapping as a continuous teaching strategy for nursing students.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that concept mapping enhances the learning outcomes of nursing students.

Additionally, there was a gradual increase in the mean scores of developed maps during the eight sessions of intervention."}
{"answers": "In this nationally representative population-based survey, HCMV seropositivity is associated with hypertension in women in the NHANES population. This association is largely explained by the association of hypertension with age and the increase in past exposure to HCMV with age.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is an association between human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection and hypertension in women, particularly in those aged 16-49 years. The association was significant after adjusting for race/ethnicity, body mass index, diabetes status, and hypercholesterolemia, but not after further adjusting for age."}
{"answers": "Although the cost-effectiveness of a single-pill strategy was within the acceptable willingness-to-pay threshold, the QALY difference were minimal. Further research is recommended to explore the long-term impact of the strategy.", "prediction_text": "The study found that combining antiretroviral agents in a single dosage form (FXD) did not result in a significant improvement in quality of life (measured by SF-6D scores) compared to using multiple free dose combinations (FRC) in HIV/AIDS patients. However, the study did show that FXD was cost-effective, with an incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of $45,540.49/quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared to FRC. The study also found that FXD dominated FRC (i.e., FXD was more cost-effective"}
{"answers": "2ME is able to enhance the antiproliferative activity of certain chemotherapeutics at pharmacological relevant concentrations. This estradiol metabolite is currently in a phase II trial in patients with refractary metastatic breast cancer and the tolerability has been shown to be very good. The combination of 2ME with chemotherapeutics may therefore offer a new clinically relevant treatment regimen for hormone-dependent cancer.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the combination of 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME) with certain chemotherapeutic drugs can result in an additive inhibitory effect on the proliferation of human ovarian cancer cells, potentially reducing the dosages of these chemotherapeutics in the treatment of ovarian cancer."}
{"answers": "Follow-up after endometrial cancer treatment varies in Italy. In this retrospective study, women with asymptomatic recurrence have shown a better clinical outcome compared with those with symptomatic relapse. The optimal approach is actually unknown, and guidelines comparing follow-up protocols have not been established. Prospective cost-effectiveness studies are needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, different follow-up modalities can play a role in the diagnosis of asymptomatic endometrial cancer relapses. The study found that among the 165 asymptomatic patients, clinical visit alone led to further examinations in 60 patients, imaging in 103 patients, and cytologic examination in 2 patients. Symptoms at recurrence can predict survival, with patients with an asymptomatic recurrence having a median survival time of 35 months compared to 13 months for symptomatic relapses (P = 0.0001). These findings suggest that imaging and cytologic examinations"}

No previous study has investigated the association of this SNP set with lipoprotein levels in women while taking into account the hormonal status of the patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, polymorphisms in the oestrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) and oestrogen receptor 2 (ESR2) genes are associated with lipid levels in response to hormone therapy (HT) in postmenopausal women. Specifically, the ESR1 rs2813544 polymorphism was associated with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in HT-treated postmenopausal women, while one ESR2 gene haplotype was associated with total cholesterol (T-chol) and LDL-C in HT-treated postmenopausal women."}
{"answers": "The prevalence of PAD is high in nursing home residents. AAI is not predictive for IHD mortality in this population. In very frail elderly traditional risk factors and PAD are less important predictors of death compared to poor functional status, nutritional factors and previous cardiovascular disease.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, the presence of PAD (Peripheral Arterial Disease) as determined by Doppler Ultrasound measurement of AAI (Ankle/Arm blood pressure Index) was not related to total mortality or to mortality for ischemic heart disease (IHD), cerebrovascular disease or other causes in older patients living in nursing homes. However, low hemoglobin values, previous cerebrovascular disease, polypharmacy, and poor mobility conditions were independently related to IHD mortality. Therefore, ankle/arm pressure measurement is not predictive of cardiovascular mortality in this population."}
{"answers": "The data demonstrate that vaccination has a relatively weak and short-lasting effect in old age. The results of the study should stimulate discussions about strategies how vaccinations can be made more effective in old age. Improved campaigns, shortened vaccination intervals as well as the design of novel vaccines tailored to fulfill the specific demands of the aging immune system are imaginable.", "prediction_text": "The study found that elderly Austrian individuals (>60 years old) are not adequately protected against infectious diseases by vaccination. The study showed that:"}
{"answers": "The introduction of a discharge coordinator improved the quality of discharge planning, but at additional cost.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the introduction of a dedicated discharge coordinator resulted in improved quality of discharge planning and reduced problems experienced by patients after discharge, as well as improved patient satisfaction."}
{"answers": "Local anesthesia is not required to lower a patient's pain intensity when applying intra-articular contrast media for MR arthrography of the shoulder. This could result in reduced costs and a reduced risk of adverse reactions, without an impact on patient comfort.", "prediction_text": "According to this study, there is no significant difference in pain intensity between patients who received subcutaneous local anesthesia prior to intraarticular administration of contrast medium for magnetic resonance arthrography (MRa) of the shoulder and those who did not receive it. The study found that the mean pain level on the visual analog scale (VAS) was 2.6 \u00b1 2.3 in patients who received local anesthesia, and 2.6 \u00b1 2.2 and 2.7 \u00b1 2.4 in patients who did not receive it in the two control groups, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that local anesthesia may not be necessary"}
{"answers": "A routinely inserted ENBD tube did not improve the clinical course, despite patients having to endure increased procedure time and discomfort, and the insertion would therefore be unnecessary.", "prediction_text": "The study found that inserting a nasobiliary drainage tube (ENBD) after endoscopic clearance of the common bile duct (CBD) in patients with choledocholithiasis-induced cholangitis did not significantly improve the clinical outcomes, including the recurrence rate of cholangitis and the length of hospital stay, at 24 weeks. However, the procedure time and discomfort score were higher in the ENBD group than in the no-ENBD group. Therefore, it is not necessary to insert a nasobiliary drainage tube routinely after endoscopic clearance of the CBD in patients with choled"}
{"answers": "Regarding the pedigree, we discuss different modes of inheritance. The presence of consanguineous unions in this family suggests the possibility of a common ancestor and thus a recessive autosomal mode of inheritance.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is evidence to suggest that nasal polyposis (NP) may have an inheritance pattern. In this study, a family with multiple members affected by NP was investigated, and a higher prevalence of NP was found among those older than 17 years compared to the national French prevalence. This suggests that there may be a genetic component to the development of NP in this family."}
{"answers": "Emergency DBE is feasible, safe and effective in acute OGIB and may avoid major surgery, diagnosing and successfully treating most patients. Combined approach with RT viewing by CE is especially useful to identify recurrent bleeding vascular lesions such as DL that may be easily misdiagnosed by non-emergency DBE.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the combination of emergency double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) and real-time viewing of capsule endoscopy (CE) is a feasible approach in the management of acute overt-obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB). The study found that emergency DBE was more effective in detecting Dieulafoy's lesions compared to DBE performed 24 hours after symptom onset. Additionally, the combined approach of CE with RT viewing modified DBE management in four patients."}
{"answers": "Laparoscopic antireflux surgery significantly improved quality of life in reflux patients whose symptoms were well controlled on medical therapy. Although on the basis of a noncomparative trial with a relatively short follow-up period, we believe such patients should be considered for laparoscopic antireflux surgery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, laparoscopic antireflux surgery improves quality of life in patients with well-controlled gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) on medical therapy. The study found significant improvements in physical and mental composite scores of the Short Form 36 questionnaire, as well as total scores of the Psychological General Well-Being index and Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale, after surgery compared to before."}
{"answers": "Patients in regional and rural settings were willing partners in developing skills of junior medical students, who had greater involvement in patient consultations than previously reported for urban students. Our study extends the findings from urban general practice that patients are underutilised partners in community-based medical training. The support of patients from regional and rural settings could facilitate the expansion of primary care-based medical education in these areas of workforce need.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the majority of patients in the study were willing participants in the new wave of community-based medical education in regional and rural Australia. They were positive about their doctor and practice being involved in student teaching and felt that they themselves played an important role in the educational process. While some patients initially expressed reluctance to allow students to conduct certain aspects of the consultation independently, most were willing to accept higher levels of involvement after the consultation."}
{"answers": "Overall, in a US Air Force population, OSA does not predict a decrease in aerobic fitness as measured by cycle ergometry. However, patients with an apnea-hypopnea index of greater than 20 have a statistically significant decrease in aerobic fitness compared to the normal population. This study demonstrates the effects of OSA on aerobic fitness. Further correlation of fitness testing results with OSA severity and treatment is needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with a decrease in aerobic fitness, as measured by maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max). This decrease in VO2max was observed in patients with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of greater than 20, and was significant compared to normalized values from a large control group."}
{"answers": "Pictorial HWLs with didactic textual forms seem to work better than those with testimonial narratives. Future research should determine which pictorial HWL content has the greatest real-world impact among consumers from disadvantaged groups, including assessment of how HWL content should change to maintain its impact as tobacco control environments strengthen and consumer awareness of smoking-related risks increases.", "prediction_text": "Yes, pictorial warning labels on cigarette packages can address smoking-related health disparities, particularly among individuals with higher levels of educational attainment. Didactic textual forms and graphic imagery of diseased organs were found to be more effective than testimonial narratives and human suffering imagery, respectively. These findings suggest that pictorial HWLs can be an effective tool in reducing smoking rates and addressing health disparities among different populations."}
{"answers": "Preferential transmission of AVPR1A to hypersexual or uninhibited people-seeking probands was not supported.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no significant evidence to suggest that the arginine vasopressin V1a receptor microsatellites are related to hypersexuality in children with a prepubertal and early adolescent bipolar disorder phenotype. The study found that there was no preferential transmission of the number of AVPR1A microsatellite repeats to hypersexual and uninhibited people-seeking probands, and no significant associations between hypersexuality or uninhibited people-seeking and the number of AVPR1A GATA or complex repeats."}
{"answers": "We suggest that regardless of family history, all children over 5 years should be screened for hyperlipidemia. Education about hyperlipidemia and precautions for its complications should be given to both children and families. The best and easiest way to reach children is to screen them at schools. School is also a good place for education of children about hyperlipidemia and risk factors.", "prediction_text": "No, family history is not a reliable indicator for choosing school children to screen for high cholesterol levels. Despite 64.4% of the subjects reporting a family history of hyperlipidemia, no relation was found between family history and serum lipid levels."}
{"answers": "These data indicate digoxin use may be associated with a reduction in risk of PCa. Given the potential mechanisms by which digoxin may exert an anti-neoplastic effect and other recent studies showing a negative association between digoxin use and PCa, further research is warranted.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that use of digoxin for cardiovascular disease is associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer. In multivariate analysis, digoxin use was found to be associated with a reduction in the odds of prostate cancer, with a stronger reduction observed among those with a history of 3 or more PSA tests in the preceding 5 years."}
{"answers": "GHD men receiving GH treatment have a mortality rate not different from the background population. In women, after exclusion of high-risk patients, mortality was not different from the background population except for CVD. Mortality due to malignancies was not elevated in adults receiving GH treatment. Next to gender, the heterogeneous etiology is of influence on mortality in GHD adults with GH treatment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, growth hormone replacement therapy (GHRT) reduces mortality in adults with growth hormone deficiency (GHD). The study found that patients treated with GHRT had a lower standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for all-cause, malignancy, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality compared to untreated patients. However, the reduction in mortality was only observed in women, and the effect was more pronounced after excluding high-risk patients. Sex, GHD onset, age, and underlying diagnosis were identified as influencing factors in univariate analyses."}
{"answers": "It seems quite admissible and justified to encourage medical students to officiate as examiners in undergraduate emergency medicine OSCE formative testing, but not necessarily in summative assessment evaluations.", "prediction_text": "Yes, student examiners can be a reasonable substitute for faculty examiners in an undergraduate OSCE on medical emergencies. The study found that students in the SE track performed significantly better in certain stations, such as Trauma Management, Airway Management, and Obstetrical Emergencies, and overall OSCE score. However, the effect sizes were small, indicating that the difference between the two groups was not large. Additionally, in the post-assessment evaluation portion of the study, students gave higher ratings for the ACS station and overall OSCE evaluation in the FE track, but the effect sizes were also small. These findings suggest that while student examiners may not be as effective as"}
{"answers": "Expression of ER is a constitutional feature of the connective tissue and smooth muscle cells of the anal continence organ. Estrogen receptors and PR are not detectable in the striated muscle fibers of the external anal sphincter in either sex. The presence of ER in the stroma and smooth muscles of the anal canal suggests that these tissues are targets for estrogen. This constitutes a theoretical basis for the beneficial effects of estrogen and progestin replacement on anal continence in postmenopausal women.", "prediction_text": "The study found that estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR) are present in the tissues of the anal canal, specifically in the smooth muscle cells of the internal sphincter and perimuscular connective tissue of both males and females. The presence of these receptors suggests that hormones may play a role in the regulation of anal continence. In females, the ER-positive tissues were found in the internal sphincter and perimuscular connective tissue, and about 50% of these tissues were also positive for PR. In males, ER and PR were only found in the smooth muscle cells of"}
{"answers": "In women with bothersome MUI, concomitant AA repair does not result in additional improvement in OAB symptoms over MUS alone. Patients with postoperative complications exhibit less improvement in OAB symptoms.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that concomitant anterior/apical repair during midurethral sling does not improve the overactive bladder component of mixed incontinence. The OAB-q SS change score was similar between the two groups."}
{"answers": "An association was found between sublingual varices and hypertension. Examining the lateral borders of the tongue is easily done, causes no harm and could be a valuable method for the dental profession to take active part in preventive healthcare.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant connection between sublingual varices and hypertension. The study found that patients with sublingual varices were more likely to have hypertension, with an odds ratio of 2.25 and a p-value of <0.002. Additionally, the study found that the mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure were higher in patients with grade 1 sublingual varices compared to those with grade 0 varices. The positive predictive value of sublingual varices for hypertension was 0.5, and the negative predictive value was 0.80."}
{"answers": "Our data suggested that visually impaired pedestrians can make accurate and reliable street crossing decisions like those of normally sighted pedestrians. When using auditory information only, all subjects significantly overestimated the vehicular gap time. Our finding that blind pedestrians performed significantly worse than either the normally sighted or visually impaired subjects under the hearing only condition suggested that they may benefit from training to improve their detection ability and/or interpretation of vehicular gap times.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that normally sighted and visually impaired pedestrians were accurate and reliable in their street crossing decision-making ability when using either vision plus hearing or vision only. However, under the auditory only condition, all subjects were reliable but inaccurate with their street crossing decisions. Blind subjects were the least accurate under the auditory only condition."}
{"answers": "Initial single scrotal incision can be recommended for orchidopexy, even in the more difficult cases of impalpable undescended testes. Advantages seem to include shorter operative time, a cosmetically appealing single incision, and possibly less pain. The scrotal incision technique significantly reduces the need for laparoscopy in impalpable testes. Surprisingly, it even allows successful orchidopexy of abdominal testes, provided an open processus is present.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the scrotal approach should be considered as the first choice for the treatment of undescended testes, both for palpable and impalpable cases. The study found that a scrotal incision orchidopexy was successful in diagnosing and treating 78% of impalpable testicles, with only 4 cases requiring conversion to laparoscopy. The approach also allowed for easy detection of atrophic testes or testicular remnants. Overall, the study suggests that the scrotal approach is a safe and effective method for managing undescended testes."}
{"answers": "Center differences in enteral feeding advancement occur and may have a significant impact on short-term outcomes such as nosocomial sepsis. Large, multicenter, prospective trials are required to further elucidate the optimal feeding strategy for VLBW infants.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the enteral feeding advancement affects the short-term outcomes of very low birth weight infants. VLBW infants born in centers with slow advancement (SA) had a higher rate of sepsis, particularly late-onset sepsis, compared to those born in centers with rapid advancement (RA). Additionally, more central venous lines and antibiotics were used in centers with SA."}
{"answers": "There appears to be no difference in the numbers of emboli detected when the first vascular clamp is applied to the proximal aorta or iliacs.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no significant difference in the number of emboli detected between the two sequences of clamp application during open abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery."}
{"answers": "GP hospitals seem to reduce the utilisation of general hospitals with respect to admissions as well as occupied bed days.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that populations with access to general practitioner hospitals (GP hospitals) utilize general hospitals less than populations without such access. The total rate of admission to general hospitals and occupied bed days were lower in peripheral municipalities with a GP hospital compared to central municipalities without one. The differences were most pronounced for certain diagnoses, such as respiratory diseases, cardiac failure, cancer, stroke, and fractures, which are primarily or intermediately treated or cared for in GP hospitals."}
{"answers": "The EBP unit was associated with better patient outcomes and more efficient performance than achieved by the same physicians previously or by SP concurrently.", "prediction_text": "Yes, evidence-based practice (EBP) was found to improve patient outcomes in the study. Compared to standard practice (SP) doctors, EBP doctors had lower mortality rates (6.3% vs 7.75%) and shorter lengths of stay (6.01 vs 8.46 days) for their patients. These differences were statistically significant. Additionally, EBP doctors attended twice as many patients as SP doctors, suggesting that EBP may lead to more efficient use of resources. However, there were no significant improvements in SP doctors' performance after the reorganization."}
{"answers": "Although travel burden is associated with timely diagnosis and treatment for some types of cancer, we did not find evidence that driving time was, in general, better at predicting timeliness of cancer diagnosis and treatment than driving distance. More intensive efforts at early detection of breast cancer and early treatment of CRC for Medicaid patients who live in remote areas may be needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, distance to provider is a barrier to care for Medicaid patients with breast, colorectal, or lung cancer. Specifically, the study found that later stage at diagnosis for breast cancer patients and longer time-to-treatment after diagnosis of colorectal cancer were associated with travel burden."}
{"answers": "Our results indicate that training managers in transformational leadership behaviours may have a positive impact on healthcare workers' health over time. However, more research is needed to examine the mechanisms by which transformational leadership brings about improved sleep quality; self-efficacy was not found to be the explanation.", "prediction_text": "No, self-efficacy does not mediate the relationship between transformational leadership behaviors and healthcare workers' sleep quality."}
{"answers": "The use of US helps in making a correct diagnosis and in the follow-up with objective criteria and also convinces the patient and the family that the treatment needs to be continued.", "prediction_text": "Yes, ultrasound can be a useful tool for diagnosing and following up on constipation in children. In this study, the authors found that ultrasound measurements of rectal diameter and anterior wall thickness were significantly higher in constipated children compared to controls, and that these measurements could be used to diagnose constipation with a high degree of accuracy. Additionally, they found that ultrasound measurements could be used to monitor the response to treatment over time. The authors suggest that ultrasound could be a useful tool for clinicians to assess constipation in children, particularly in cases where other diagnostic tests such as barium enema or radiography are not feasible or practical."}
{"answers": "Brachytherapy with ruthenium applicators is an effective therapy for small- and medium-size posterior uveal melanomas. Our results are comparable to other series. The treatment outcome does not seem to be capable of improvement by increasing the apical dose. An internationally accepted model for defining the dosage in brachytherapy is needed.", "prediction_text": "The study found that escalating the apical dose from 100 to 160 Gy did not significantly improve treatment outcomes in beta-radiation of posterior choroidal melanomas with 106Ru plaques. The overall 5-year survival rate and disease-specific survival rate were similar in both groups, and the main side effects were mostly uncomplicated retinopathy."}
{"answers": "The addition of epinephrine to ACLS-SAPO increases vital organ perfusion pressures and improves outcome from cardiac arrest. There appears to be a profound loss of arterial vasomotor tone after prolonged arrest. This loss of vasomotor tone may make exogenous pressors necessary for resuscitation after prolonged cardiac arrest.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a pressor is necessary during aortic perfusion and oxygenation therapy of cardiac arrest. The study found that administration of epinephrine during aortic perfusion and oxygenation therapy (SAPO) increased the mean aortic relaxation pressure and coronary perfusion pressure, and improved the rate of return of spontaneous circulation in a canine model of ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest. The results suggest that exogenous epinephrine may be necessary to improve the efficacy of SAPO in restoring coronary perfusion and cardiac function during ACLS."}
{"answers": "In a leading specialty journal, cited reviewers gave higher scores than noncited reviewers. However, this\u00a0was likely due to their being assigned higher-quality manuscripts and not because they were cited in the manuscript. Reviewer requests that their work be cited were rare.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that reviewers' scores are influenced by citations to their own work. The mean score of reviews by cited reviewers was higher than that of non-cited reviewers, and the difference was statistically significant. However, when adjusting for the quality of the manuscript, the effect size was reduced. Additionally, reviewers were more likely to suggest adding a citation to their own work than to the work of other reviewers."}
{"answers": "Preoperative education delivered by nurses reduced anxiety and postoperative complications of patients undergoing cardiac surgery, but it was not effective in reducing readmissions or length of stay.", "prediction_text": "Yes, nurse-led preoperative education can reduce anxiety and postoperative complications of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The study found that patients who received preoperative education from specially trained nurses had lower levels of state anxiety on the day before surgery and during the follow-up period, compared to those who received standard information from ward personnel. Additionally, the intervention group had a lower proportion of chest infections. Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that education and trait anxiety scale score on admission were independent predictors of a reduction in state anxiety."}
{"answers": "Improving hospital efficiency by shortening length of stay does not appear to result in increased rates of readmission or numbers of physician visits within 30 days after discharge from hospital. Research is needed to identify optimal lengths of stay and expected readmission rates.", "prediction_text": "The study found that decreasing lengths of stay for selected diagnostic categories in Winnipeg hospitals from 1989-90 to 1992-93 was not associated with increased hospital readmission rates or mean number of physician visits after discharge. In fact, the readmission rates for some categories (e.g. AMI, bronchitis or asthma) remained constant or decreased over time, while the mean number of physician visits decreased for one category (AMI). These findings suggest that discharging patients earlier from Winnipeg hospitals did not adversely affect the quality of care provided."}
{"answers": "Solitary kidney in a canine model is more resistant to ischemia than paired kidneys based on radiological, pathological and genetic evidence.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that a solitary kidney is more susceptible to warm ischemia-induced damage compared to a paired kidney. While the solitary kidney in group 1 showed some signs of recovery, such as regeneration of tubular structures, the damage was more pronounced and sustained for a longer period of time compared to the paired kidney group. Additionally, the expression of proinflammatory markers was higher and more sustained in the solitary kidney group, indicating more severe inflammation. Therefore, the study suggests that a solitary kidney is not as resilient to warm ischemia as previously thought."}
{"answers": "Elective re-siting of intravenous cannulae every 48 hours results in a significant reduction in the incidence and severity of PVT. We recommend that this should be adopted as standard practice in managing all patients who require prolonged intravenous therapy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, elective re-siting of intravenous cannulae every 48 hours significantly decreases the incidence and severity of peripheral thrombophlebitis in patients receiving intravenous fluids/drugs."}
{"answers": "We conclude that 3-phase bone scintigraphy prior to surgery could be a useful method to determine the amputation level in a diabetic foot. We conclude that further, comparative, more comprehensive, long-term, and controlled studies are required.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, 3-phase bone scintigraphy is a potential method for determining the level of amputation in diabetic foot. The study found that 3-phase bone scintigraphy was able to accurately determine the amputation level in 80% of the patients, with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 86%. However, it is important to note that this study had a small sample size and further larger-scale studies are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "At baseline assessment patients of lower socioeconomic status showed lower health related quality of life. Since there was no clear trend at follow-up assessment this suggests that patients from different socioeconomic status responded to treatment similarly. In general, the findings suggest that quality of life is not only the outcome of the disease and its treatment, but is also highly dependent on each patients' socioeconomic characteristics.", "prediction_text": "Yes, socioeconomic status (SES) matters in quality of life (QoL) in lung cancer patients. At baseline, patients of lower SES had more health problems, less functioning, and more symptoms compared to affluent patients. However, there was no significant difference between patient groups at follow-up."}
{"answers": "General surgery research residents' intraoperative leadership skills showed significant correlations to their perceptions of skill decay and task difficulty during a bowel repair. Evaluating resident's directional instructions may provide an additional individualized intraoperative assessment metric. Further evaluation relating to operative performance outcomes is warranted.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that residents' leadership skills, as reflected in the number of instructions given to their assistants during a simulated small bowel repair, were related to their ratings of technical skill. Specifically, residents who rated lower levels of decay in their intraoperative decision-making and small bowel repair skills were found to use their assistants more by giving more instructions. Additionally, a higher number of instructions correlated with lower perceived difficulty in selecting the correct suture, suture pattern, and completing the entire surgical task."}
{"answers": "The severity of TAI is influenced by the sharpness of the aortic arch. There is an inverse relationship between the severity of aortic injury and the aortic arch index.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the anatomy of the aortic arch influences the severity of traumatic aortic injury. Specifically, the aortic arch angle is significantly associated with the occurrence of type III damage."}
{"answers": "Clinical variables, either isolated or as components of a model, could not identify all children with pathologic radiographs.", "prediction_text": "No, clinical variables do not accurately predict pathologic radiographs in the first episode of wheezing. The study found that pretreatment oxygen saturation was the only variable that significantly differed between children with pathologic and nonpathologic radiographs. Clinical score, respiratory rate, and presence of rales did not differ significantly between the two groups. The discriminant analysis was able to correctly predict nonpathologic radiographs in 90% of cases, but only 15% of pathologic radiographs."}
{"answers": "The results showed no overall first night effect on severity of RMMA frequency in young and healthy patients with SB. In clinical practice, one-night sleep recording may be sufficient for moderate-high frequency SB patients. However, low RMMA frequency in the first night could be confirmed by a second night based on the patient's medical and dental history.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a first night effect on sleep bruxism. The study found that the second night showed significantly higher burst index, bruxism time index, and mean burst duration compared to the first night. Additionally, there was a shift in the severity of rhythmic masticatory muscle activity (RMMA) from low frequency to moderate-high frequency on the second night, with five patients moving from the low frequency group to the moderate-high frequency group."}
{"answers": "Athletes engaged in competitive sports are more likely to develop ventricular arrhythmias during exercise. These arrhythmias subside over time when athletes are engaged in non-competitive sports.", "prediction_text": "Yes, ventricular arrhythmias in athletes tend to subside over time. The study found that among athletes who experienced ventricular arrhythmias during an initial exercise test, the majority had fewer or no arrhythmias during a repeat exercise test performed after a mean follow-up period of 70 months."}
{"answers": "A well developed collateral circulation does not predict an increased risk of restenosis after PCI.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that a well-developed collateral circulation does not predispose to restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In fact, the study found that patients with good collaterals had more severe coronary stenoses at baseline, suggesting that they may be at higher risk of restenosis despite having a well-developed collateral circulation. The study also found that restenosis rates were similar in poor and good collateral groups, and that CFI was not correlated with restenosis measures such as diameter, area, or volumetric restenosis."}
{"answers": "We conclude that patient and graft survival on transplanting kidneys from elderly donors to young recipients is superimposable on that obtained with young donors. However, renal function is better in the group of young donors.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that it is appropriate to implant kidneys from elderly donors in young recipients. The survival rates and graft survival rates were similar between the two groups, and the creatinine levels were higher in the young recipients. These findings suggest that age of the donor does not have a significant impact on the outcome of kidney transplantation in young recipients."}
{"answers": "Many patients do not understand their ED care or their discharge instructions. Moreover, most patients appear to be unaware of their lack of understanding and report inappropriate confidence in their comprehension and recall.", "prediction_text": "No, most patients (78%) did not demonstrate complete comprehension of their emergency department (ED) care and instructions, and a significant proportion (51%) had deficiencies in their comprehension in at least 2 domains. Only 20% of patients who had comprehension deficits reported difficulty with understanding."}
{"answers": "The results of this study suggest that normothermic CPB does not prevent the development of the \"euthyroid sick syndrome\" during and after CPB. Despite these changes in thyroid function, most patients in both groups had a normal postoperative recovery.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, the temperature during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) does not appear to have a significant effect on the development of postoperative euthyroid sick syndrome (ESS). The study found that both hypothermic and normothermic CPB resulted in similar reductions in serum concentrations of total thyroxine (TT4) and total triiodothyronine (TT3) beginning with CPB and persisting for up to 5 days after CPB. Additionally, free triiodothyronine (fT3) was reduced for up to 3 days after CPB, and mean serum reverse T3 (rT3) was elevated on post"}
{"answers": "Severe hypoglycaemia is associated with an increased risk for CV outcomes in people at high CV risk and dysglycaemia. Although allocation to insulin glargine vs. standard care was associated with an increased risk of severe and non-severe hypoglycaemia, the relative risk of CV outcomes with hypoglycaemia was lower with insulin glargine-based glucose-lowering therapy than with the standard glycaemic control. Trial Registration (ORIGIN ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00069784).", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that severe hypoglycaemia was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, including the composite of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke, mortality, CV mortality, and arrhythmic death. The hazard for these outcomes was higher with standard care than with insulin glargine."}
{"answers": "EDWS is a safe and effective treatment for esophagogastric varices secondary to portal hypertension in selected patients. Patients treated with EDWS had a lower complication rate of portal venous system thrombosis compared with those treated with conventional MED.", "prediction_text": "Yes, esophagogastric devascularization without splenectomy (EDWS) is a safe and effective treatment for portal hypertension, with a lower morbidity rate of portal venous system thrombosis compared to the modified esophagogastric devascularization (MED) with splenectomy."}
{"answers": "Significant postoperative pain can be expected in the following situations: pain after prior surgery, presence of chronic pain sustained for more than six months, intense preoperative pain, state of depression.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the postoperative pain level can be predicted preoperatively based on certain factors such as a prior history of surgical pain, duration of prior pain, intensity of preoperative pain, and depression."}
{"answers": "The general practice selection process is predictive of future performance in the MRCGP.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found a statistically significant correlation between general practice selection scores and performance at the MRCGP examination, specifically in the applied knowledge test (AKT) and clinical skills assessment (CSA) components."}
{"answers": "Although the association of prostate and lung cancer is uncommon, the possibility of synchronous tumors should be considered in patients with urinary and pulmonary symptoms suggestive of neoplasm. It is important to determine if the lesion is a metastasis, since the prognosis depends on the second tumor.", "prediction_text": "No, prostatic syndrome and pleural effusion are not different diseases. The paper you are referring to is discussing the association between prostate cancer and lung cancer, and how they present differently in terms of symptoms and metastasis. Prostatic syndrome refers to a group of symptoms that can occur as a result of a prostate tumor, such as urinary frequency, hesitancy, and pain, while pleural effusion refers to the accumulation of fluid in the space between the lungs and the chest wall. In this paper, the authors are suggesting that the two conditions are related and may be caused by the same underlying cancer."}
{"answers": "The practice of intensive observation for the first transfusion in pediatric patients is probably unnecessary.", "prediction_text": "No, temporary ICU admission for the first transfusion is not warranted in pediatric patients, as only mild reactions occurred and none required intensive management."}
{"answers": "There is no indication of a rebound aggravation of symptoms 12 to 14 days after a 5-day treatment with lansoprazole 60 mg once daily in patients with reflux symptoms.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no significant difference in the rebound aggravation of symptoms between the group given lansoprazole first and the group given placebo first."}
{"answers": "Our long-term study showed significantly better (2-fold) results regarding the continence score for the abdominal approach compared with the transanal pull-through. The stool pattern and enterocolitis scores were somewhat better for the TERPT group. These findings raise an important issue about the current surgical management of HD; however, more cases will need to be studied before a definitive conclusion can be drawn.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the long-term outcomes of the transanal endorectal pull-through (TERPT) and the transabdominal (ABD) pull-through for Hirschsprung disease (HD) are similar, with no significant difference in overall scores. However, the study did find that the ABD group had better continence scores, while the TERPT group had better stool pattern scores. After controlling for age, the study found that age did not significantly affect the long-term scoring outcome between the two groups."}

{"answers": "It is concluded from the study that this knowledge if applied to dead human subjects, may preserve dead bodies temporarily allowing delayed funeral.", "prediction_text": "Yes, homemade alcohol (Raksi) can be useful for preserving dead bodies as an alternative to standard embalming chemicals. In a study conducted on sacrificed rats, Raksi was found to effectively arrest postmortem changes in the experimental group up to 72 hours (3rd day) successfully, while moderate to severe changes were seen in the control group. Raksi contains 34% alcohol, which has preservative, bactericidal, and disinfectant properties, making it a potential temporary embalming agent."}
{"answers": "The Holmium:YAG laser is an ideal intracorporeal lithotripter for ureteral calculi, with a high success rate and low morbidity.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that holmium:YAG laser lithotripsy is an efficient and safe treatment for ureteral stones, with a high success rate and low complication rate. However, the study does not directly compare the holmium:YAG laser with other intracorporeal lithotripters, so it cannot be concluded that it is the best option. Further studies are needed to compare the efficacy and safety of different lithotripters for ureteral stones."}
{"answers": "Our results suggested that s.c. anti-TNF pharmacokinetics do not significantly influence US-scored synovitis in RA patients.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no significant dependence of ultrasound-scored synovitis on the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous anti-TNF agents in patients with rheumatoid arthritis."}
