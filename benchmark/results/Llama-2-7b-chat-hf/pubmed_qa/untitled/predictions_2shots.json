{"answers": "These data suggest that being willing and fit enough for a chemotherapy protocol is a good prognostic factor for invasive bladder cancer. This eligibility bias emphasizes the need for prospective, randomized trials, and indicates that single-group studies using historical or matched controls have to be interpreted with caution.", "prediction_text": "No, eligibility for an adjuvant chemotherapy protocol after radical cystectomy is not a good prognostic factor for invasive bladder cancer."}
{"answers": "An additional delayed phase through the abdomen in routine contrast-enhanced CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis is of low yield, particularly if reliable follow-up imaging to further elucidate uncertain findings is available.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that delayed imaging in routine CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis may not be worth the additional cost of radiation and time, as the majority of patients (95.8%) did not have any additional findings that were only visible in the delayed phase. The most significant finding was the detection of a renal mass in one patient, which was difficult to appreciate in the portal venous phase but was visible in the delayed phase. However, the overall benefit of delayed imaging in this study was limited, and the additional radiation exposure may not be justified for routine examinations."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that the SCL 90-R is best viewed as an indicator of unidimensional emotional distress and somatic effects of structural brain injury.", "prediction_text": "No, the Symptom Checklist 90-R Obsessive-Compulsive subscale does not identify cognitive impairments in individuals with brain tumors."}
{"answers": "The results suggest that NA treatment can be stopped in selected patients with CHB as long as they are not cirrhotic, have completed a minimum period of treatment, have normal ALT and sustained undetectable DNA. These patients should be closely monitored during the first year and then indefinitely.", "prediction_text": "Yes, it is possible to stop treatment with nucleos(t)ide analogs (NAs) in patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B (CHB), but the rate of virological relapse is high, with 54.54% of patients experiencing a relapse within 6.38 months (\u00b1 1.9) after discontinuation."}
{"answers": "The results of this study do not support the hypothesis that there is a direct link between atmospheric pressure values and abdominal aortic aneurysm ruptures.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the diameter of the aneurysm is important in determining the influence of atmospheric pressure on aortic aneurysm rupture. The study found that larger aneurysms (>7 cm) were more likely to rupture in cases where the atmospheric pressure increased between the day before the rupture and the day of the rupture, with a trend towards higher rupture rates in patients with hypertension."}
{"answers": "Findings from these studies support discordance between device-recorded and self-reported hot flashes. In addition, the studies reveal further limitations of SSC monitoring, including difficulties with data collection and lack of consistency in interpretation. Based on these results and other recent trials identifying issues with SSC methodology, it is time to find a better physiologic surrogate measure for hot flashes.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the sternal skin conductance (SSC) device is not a reliable or accurate measure of hot flashes, with a concordance rate of only 24% between self-reported and device-recorded hot flashes. Therefore, it is not a reasonable surrogate for hot flash measurement."}
{"answers": ": Prophylactic fixation with a cephalomedullary nail was not found to be cost-effective for the average older woman who sustained a hip fracture. However, it may be appropriate for select patient populations. The study supports the need for basic science and clinical trials investigating the effectiveness of prophylactic fixation for patient populations at higher lifetime risk for contralateral hip fracture.", "prediction_text": "Prophylactic fixation of the uninjured hip is not cost-effective for a 79-year-old woman, but it can be a cost-effective method for certain subgroups of patients, such as women aged 71-75 years with a 30% greater relative risk for a contralateral fracture, or women younger than age 70 years. However, the cost-effectiveness of prophylactic fixation is highly sensitive to the effectiveness and relative morbidity and mortality of the additional procedure."}
{"answers": "We found that USMLE Step 2, number of honors in medical school clerkships, and AOA membership demonstrated the strongest correlations with resident performance. Our goal in analyzing these data was to provide residency programs at large a sense of which criteria may be \"high yield\" in ranking applicants by analyzing data from within our own pool of residents. Similar studies across a broader scope of programs are warranted to confirm applicability of our findings. The continually emerging complexities of the field of orthopaedic surgery lend increasing importance to future work on the appropriate selection and training of orthopaedic residents.", "prediction_text": "Yes, certain preresidency selection criteria were found to be predictive of objective and subjective measures of resident performance in orthopaedic surgery residency. Specifically, USMLE Step 2 scores and number of clinical honors received in medical school were associated with ABOS Part I scores, while AOA membership was associated with higher global evaluation scores and \"interpersonal and communication skills\" subsection of the global evaluations."}
{"answers": "In vitro fertilization outcome is strongly correlated with both maternal ages, basal cycle, day 3 follicle, stimulated hormone, and antral follicle assessment. Antral follicle assessment was a better predictor of in vitro fertilization outcome than were age or follicle stimulated hormone. Antral follicle assessment may provide a marker for ovarian age that is distinct from chronological age or hormonal markers.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that baseline antral follicle assessment may be a better predictor of in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcome than age and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels. The clinical pregnancy rate was significantly higher in the group with baseline antral follicle >6 compared to those with antral follicle <or = 6, even after controlling for patient age and basal FSH levels. Additionally, the cancellation rate was significantly higher in the group with baseline antral follicle <or = 6 compared to those with antral follicle >or = 6."}
{"answers": "Neither insertion of PEG tubes nor timing of insertion affect survival.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that feeding tube insertion and its timing do not improve survival in nursing home residents with advanced cognitive impairment and new problems eating."}
{"answers": "In this well established early discharge program with nurse home visits, newborn metabolic screening is not compromised by early discharge.", "prediction_text": "Yes, early discharge with nurse home visits affects the adequacy of newborn metabolic screening. Early discharge infants had a higher rate of initial filter paper specimens being inadequate, but a higher rate of repeat specimens when the initial specimen was inadequate. Additionally, the early discharge group was more likely to have an adequate specimen within the first 9 days of life."}
{"answers": "The palliative treatment concept of 25\u00a0Gy applied in 5\u00a0fractions is sufficient for radiation of lung cancer, given that there was no obvious survival improvement in patients treated with the higher total dose regimen.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that high-dose radiotherapy (50 Gy in 20 fractions) does not significantly improve overall survival in palliative lung cancer patients compared to lower dose radiotherapy (25 Gy in 5 fractions), at least in patients with a good-fair overall condition."}
{"answers": "Although elevated leukocyte count and CRP value cannot effectively establish the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the elderly, unelevated values exclude it. Accordingly, appendectomy is not recommended to be performed in an elderly patient with unelevated leukocyte count and CRP value, although clinical symptoms and signs indicate acute appendicitis.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that there is no significant difference in leukocyte count and CRP values between patients with an uninflamed appendix and those with acute appendicitis in the elderly population, and therefore, leukocyte and CRP measurements may not have a role in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in this age group."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrates that in patients at risk for cardiac morbidity undergoing vascular surgery, desflurane is effective to control intraoperative hypertension without fear of major cardiac depressant effect.", "prediction_text": "Yes, desflurane can alter left ventricular function when used to control surgical stimulation during aortic surgery. The study found that the addition of desflurane to control hypertension during surgery resulted in an increase in afterload, as measured by systemic vascular resistance index, end-systolic wall stress, and left-ventricular stroke work index. However, there were no changes in heart rate, cardiac index, mean pulmonary arterial pressure, stroke volume, end-diastolic and end-systolic cross-sectional areas, fractional area change, or left ventricular circumferential fiber shortening."}
{"answers": "Development of tolerance to gluten seems possible in some patients with CD. Further follow-up will show whether this tolerance is permanent or only a long-term return to latency. This feature may be associated with genetic characteristics, especially with HLA genotypes that differ from DQ2 or DQ8. More insight into the mechanisms of the development of gluten tolerance may help to distinguish those CD patients that might not require life-long GFD.", "prediction_text": "Approximately 23% of adult patients with celiac disease (CD) who have been on a gluten-free diet (GFD) for 20 years or more have developed tolerance to gluten, as evidenced by the absence of immunological or histological signs of CD in the small intestine."}
{"answers": "No home-prepared replacement milks in South Africa meet all estimated micronutrient and essential fatty acid requirements of infants aged<6 months. Commercial infant formula is the only replacement milk that meets all nutritional needs. Revisions of WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF HIV and infant feeding course replacement milk options are needed. If replacement milks are to provide total nutrition, preparations should include vegetable oils, such as soybean oil, as a source of linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids, and additional vitamins and minerals.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF-recommended replacement milks for infants of HIV-infected mothers may not be entirely appropriate in the South African context, particularly with regards to micronutrient adequacy and cost. While PM and FM provided some essential nutrients, they often fell short of the recommended amounts, and the cost of preparing these milks was found to be relatively high compared to the average monthly income of domestic or shop workers."}
{"answers": "We have shown that eosinophilic inflammation of the airway wall may increase PD and that the association of eosinophil counts with ICSs may result in lessening the PD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) appear to affect the perception of dyspnea during bronchoconstriction in asthma patients. The study found that ICS-treated patients had lower VAS scores for dyspnea during a methacholine-induced FEV1 decrease compared to ICS-naive patients. Additionally, eosinophil counts and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) were found to be negatively associated with PD in ICS-treated patients, while eosinophil counts were positively associated with PD in ICS-naive patients."}
{"answers": "High socioeconomic status was associated with a higher acceptance rate of preventive home visits, but the association was attenuated by invitational procedures. The results indicate that the social inequality in acceptance of publicly offered preventive services might decrease if municipalities adopt more proactive invitational procedures.", "prediction_text": "Yes, acceptance rates of a national preventive home visit program for older people are socially imbalanced, with older people with high financial assets more likely to accept the program than those with low financial assets, and the association is attenuated when adjusted by the invitational procedures used by the municipalities."}
{"answers": "In the present study, FT and androstenedione were statistically significantly correlated with sexual desire in the total cohort of women. ADT-G did not correlate more strongly than circulating androgens with sexual desire and is therefore not superior to measuring circulating androgens by mass spectrometry.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a correlation between androgens and sexual desire in women, although the correlation is not strong and varies by age group. In the total cohort of women, sexual desire correlated with calculated free testosterone (FT) and androstenedione. In a subgroup of women aged 25-44 years, sexual desire also correlated with total testosterone (TT), FT, androstenedione, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS). In women aged 45-65 years, androstenedione correlated with sexual desire. No correlation was found between the primary androgen metabolite androsterone gl"}
{"answers": "The results of these analyses suggest that marginally higher rates of depression to age 35 amongst the comorbid MD/AUD group were explained by increased exposure to adverse childhood circumstances amongst members of the comorbid group. Adolescent MD/AUD comorbidity is likely to be a risk marker, rather than a causal factor in subsequent MD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that comorbidity of major depression (MD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD) in adolescence is associated with poorer outcomes of MD in adulthood, after adjusting for confounding factors."}
{"answers": "There are no statistically apparent motion differences between SUP-CTV and INF-CTV. Current uniform planning target volume (PTV) margins are adequate to cover both portions of the CTV.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no significant difference in target motion between the superior and inferior portions of the clinical target volume (PB-CTV) in patients with prostate cancer, according to the study."}
{"answers": "Combined end points for adverse events are acceptable in the octogenarian. Carotid endarterectomy remains the gold standard for treatment of extracranial carotid disease in all age groups. Age alone should not place patients in the high-risk category for carotid endarterectomy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, octogenarians (patients aged 80-89 years) are considered high-risk for carotid endarterectomy due to the increased risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality."}
{"answers": "Lysosomotropic amines in combination with cyclosporine appear to be synergistic in the suppression of T-cell proliferation to MiHC and MHC. Use of chloroquine in combination with cyclosporine may result in improved control of GVHD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, synergy exists between lysosomotropic amines and cyclosporine in suppressing T-cell responses to minor and major histocompatibility antigens in mice."}
{"answers": "The results of this study suggest that the cardiovascular response to exercise training may be different in men and women. Women may benefit more from interventions aimed to increase physical activity as a tool for prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.", "prediction_text": "Yes, exercise training has a significant effect on heart rate and QT interval in healthy young individuals, with trained individuals showing lower heart rates and higher heart rate variability compared to sedentary subjects. Additionally, there are gender differences in the effects of exercise training on the QT/RR slope, with a more pronounced effect in women."}
{"answers": "Although BD is correlated with GCS at presentation and RTS, it is not a reliable prognostic marker for outcome and mortality in patients with isolated TBI.", "prediction_text": "No, base deficit does not predict mortality in patients with severe traumatic brain injury, according to the study. The area under the receiver operator curve (ROC) for BD as a predictor of mortality was statistically non-significant."}
{"answers": "\"Aquagenic maladies\" could be a pediatric form of the aquagenic urticaria.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that syncope during bathing in infants may be a form of water-induced urticaria, specifically aquagenic urticaria."}
{"answers": "Laparoscopic procedures caused detectable damage to Kupffer and endothelial cells as reflected by elevation of post-operative HA serum levels. The damage to the liver hepatocytes and perisinusoidal cells has no clinical significance and the laparoscopic procedure itself is the probable cause of the Kupffer and endothelial cells damage, while other mechanisms caused damage to the hepatocytes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, laparoscopic cholecystectomy appears to influence peri-sinusoidal cell activity, as evidenced by the significant increase in serum hyaluronic acid (HA) levels in patients who underwent the procedure."}
{"answers": "Sleep disorders are common in the general adult population of Japan. Correction for reporting heterogeneity using anchoring vignettes is not a necessary tool for proper management of sleep and energy related problems among Japanese adults. Older age, gender differences in communicating sleep-related problems, the presence of multiple morbidities, and regular exercise should be the focus of policies and clinical practice to improve sleep and energy management in Japan.", "prediction_text": "Yes, adjustment for reporting heterogeneity is necessary in sleep disorders. The study found that without correction for reporting heterogeneity, certain factors such as age, sex, and number of comorbidities were associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems. However, after correction, only age, number of comorbidities, and regular exercise remained significantly associated with sleep problems. This suggests that adjusting for reporting heterogeneity is important in accurately assessing the factors associated with sleep disorders."}
{"answers": "Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is often challenging in men on account of more adhesions and inflammation. This leads to higher conversion rates and more postoperative complications. Optimized planning and a more experienced operating surgeon may help overcome these problems.", "prediction_text": "Yes, sex affects the outcome of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Male patients have a higher conversion rate and longer operating time, and are at higher risk of bile duct injuries, gallbladder perforation, and gallstone spillage compared to female patients."}
{"answers": "To uphold the notion for radiation exposure to be as low as reasonably achievable, ureteroscopic stone retrieval can safely be done without the use of fluoroscopy in a significant number of patients.", "prediction_text": "No, fluoroscopy is not essential for the retrieval of lower ureteric stones in this study population. Complete clearance without the use of fluoroscopy was achieved in 94.2% of patients."}
{"answers": "Surrogates of injury severity, including days in the ICU and non-ICU hospital LOS>10 days, were associated with the development of HO in our cohort of acetabular fracture patients. Prophylaxis with XRT was significantly protective against the development of HO, and the ability to provide prophylaxis is very likely related to the severity of injury.", "prediction_text": "Yes, surrogates of injury severity, such as length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU, and the use of external radiation beam therapy (XRT), are significantly associated with the development and severity of heterotopic ossification (HO) in fractures of the acetabulum."}
{"answers": "In this series of 35 patients, the use of epidural analgesia for HIPEC does not seem to be associated with a worse risk of haemodynamic instability, spinal haematoma, meningitis or epidural abscess. HIPEC with platinum salt is not incompatible with the safety of epidural analgesia, with an optimized fluid management peroperatively and the following of perimedullary anesthesia practice guidelines.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that epidural analgesia for surgical treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis is not associated with a significant risk of spinal haematoma, meningitis, or epidural abscess. However, the study does note that five patients (14%) had a thrombopenia or prothrombin time less than 60% before catheter removal, and two patients (6%) had a leukopenia before catheter removal."}
{"answers": "The Diabeo system improved glycaemic control in both high and low users who avidly used the IDA function, while the greatest improvement was seen in the low users who had the motivational support of teleconsultations.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that technology alone may not be sufficient to improve glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes, as the improvement in HbA1c levels was only observed in high users who received both the smartphone and telemonitoring/teleconsultation functions."}
{"answers": "Despite a lower risk of breast cancer, the Sami attended the NBCSP more frequently than the control group. The recall and cancer detection rate was lower among the Sami compared with the non-Sami group.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that early outcome measures of mammographic screening in Sami-speaking municipalities were influenced by ethnicity. The attendance rate and recall rate in the Sami population were lower compared to the control group, while the rate of invasive screen-detected cancer was not significantly lower in the Sami group. Additionally, a lower percentage of breast cancers were detected in the NBCSP among the Sami population compared to the control group."}
{"answers": "GP ablation did not prove to be beneficial for postoperative stable NSR. A complete left atrial lesion set and biatrial ablation are advisable for improving rhythm outcomes. Randomized controlled trials are necessary to confirm our findings.", "prediction_text": "No, ganglionated plexi ablation during the Maze IV procedure does not appear to be beneficial for postoperative long-term stable sinus rhythm."}
{"answers": "It is concluded that serum pancreatic lipase is a more accurate biomarker of acute pancreatitis than serum amylase.", "prediction_text": "Based on the study, serum pancreatic lipase may be a more accurate biomarker than serum amylase for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, with an improved diagnostic accuracy (AUC) of 0.948 compared to 0.906 for serum amylase (P < 0.05). A clinically useful cut-off point for serum pancreatic lipase is suggested to be at 208 U/L, with a sensitivity of 90.3% and specificity of 93%. However, it is important to note that a significant proportion of acute pancreatitis patients (18."}
{"answers": "Transgastric endoscopic splenectomy in a porcine model appears technically feasible. Additional long-term survival experiments are planned.", "prediction_text": "Yes, transgastric endoscopic splenectomy is possible. The study demonstrated the technical feasibility of per-oral transgastric splenectomy using a flexible endoscope in a porcine model."}
{"answers": "Brachial systolic blood pressure difference is related to the severity of SSS and can be used as a screening tool for SSS. However, it performed better in severe steal than milder steal phenomena.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the blood pressure difference between arms can predict the severity of subclavian steal syndrome (SSS). In this study, patients with complete reversal or alternating flow in the vertebral artery waveform had higher blood pressure differences between arms compared to those with systolic deceleration. This suggests that the degree of blood pressure difference between arms may be a useful indicator of the severity of SSS."}
{"answers": "a-tDCS could be useful in identifying residual connectivity markers in clinically-defined UWS, who may lack of purposeful behavior as a result of a motor-output failure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can be useful in differentiating unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) from minimally conscious state (MCS) patients. The study found that a-tDCS can boost cortical connectivity and excitability in all healthy individuals, MCS, and UWS patients, and can unmask excitability/connectivity in some UWS patients."}
{"answers": "Most people in France are influenced by situational factors when deciding if a physician should breach confidentiality to protect the spouse of a patient infected with STD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that lay people and psychologists in France generally find it more acceptable to breach confidentiality to protect a patient's wife from a sexually transmitted disease (STD) than physicians do."}
{"answers": "Most students do not encounter all 10 conditions during patient encounters throughout a 4-week EM rotation, although most have exposure to at least eight. Certain conditions are far less likely than others to be encountered, and may need to be taught in a nonclinical setting.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, the majority of medical students (76.9%) saw at least eight of the 10 core emergent conditions identified by the Clerkship Directors in Emergency Medicine (CDEM) National Curriculum Task Force during their 4-week Emergency Medicine (EM) clerkship, with 15.4% seeing all 10 conditions."}
{"answers": "The findings indicate that the clinical significance of symptomatic BDS is similar to that of CBD stones. Bile duct sludge seems to be an early stage of choledocholithiasis.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that bile duct sludge (BDS) is different from bile duct stones (CBD stones) in terms of frequency, associated risk factors, and clinical outcome after endoscopic therapy. BDS is more common in females and is not associated with the same risk factors for recurrent CBD stones as CBD stones."}
{"answers": "Routine placement of nasogastric tube in patients operated of LSG seems not useful in reducing leaks' incidence.", "prediction_text": "Yes, nasogastric decompression is useful in preventing staple line leaks after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. The study found that the incidence of staple line leaks was significantly lower in the group that underwent nasogastric decompression during the procedure (0% vs 1.4%)."}
{"answers": "The results obtained in this study demonstrate that LUS is an accurate and highly sensitive procedure in staging colorectal cancer, providing a useful and reliable diagnostic tool complementary to laparoscopy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, laparoscopic sonography (LUS) is a reliable and sensitive procedure for staging colorectal cancer, particularly for evaluating hepatic metastases, with a sensitivity of 100% compared to preoperative diagnostic means and laparoscopy. However, its specificity is relatively low (53%)."}
{"answers": "Most community providers believe IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion; this belief is associated with increased resource use. Experts comply more closely with guidelines to diagnose IBS with minimal testing. This disconnect suggests that better implementation of guidelines is warranted to minimize variation and improve cost-effectiveness of care.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, experts in IBS are less likely to consider IBS as a diagnosis of exclusion compared to non-experts."}
{"answers": "Correlation between level of radiographic transition zone on contrast enema and length of aganglionosis remains low. Systematic preoperative biopsy by coelioscopy or ombilical incision is mandatory.", "prediction_text": "The correlation between the radiographic transition zone on contrast enema and the level of aganglionosis on the specimen in Hirschsprung's disease is moderate, with an agreement of 58.1% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.39."}
{"answers": "The presence of a high signal intensity change on T2-weighted MRI and the pyramidal tract sign can be used as prognostic factors for patients with CSA.", "prediction_text": "Yes, signs of spinal cord involvement, such as the presence of T2 high signal intensity areas (T2 HIA) on MRI, are associated with a poorer neurological prognosis in patients with cervical spondylotic amyotrophy (CSA)."}
{"answers": "We conclude that not all low-tone sudden deafness (SD) patients suffered from endolymphatic hydrops even if they had vertigo attack at the onset and that electrocochleography (ECochG) was a useful prognostic tool.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that low-tone sudden deafness does not inevitably progress to Meniere's disease. The prognosis of low-tone sudden deafness is not significantly different from that of high-tone sudden deafness in terms of progression to Meniere's disease."}
{"answers": "It is concluded that ACE-DD genotype may be a risk factor for the causation and development of chronic kidney failure among hypertensive patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that ACE-1 gene polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) among hypertensive patients."}
{"answers": "Older people with a history of amblyopia who develop visual loss in the previously normal eye can experience recovery of visual function in the amblyopic eye over a period of time. This recovery in visual function occurs in the wake of visual loss in the fellow eye and the improvement appears to be sustained.", "prediction_text": "No, visual loss due to amblyopia is not permanent. The study found that in 9 out of 12 cases of improved visual acuity in amblyopic eyes, the improvement occurred within 1-12 months and remained stable over the period of follow-up."}
{"answers": "These results suggest that quantitative real-time PCR assays for BCRABL detection can be comparable between laboratories despite significant differences in methodologies if the same positive control cell line and quality control gene are used. It is imperative that some level of assay standardization be adopted between laboratories, not only for patients who are monitored at different facilities, but also for larger investigative studies in which hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular responses are to be compared.", "prediction_text": "Yes, correlated results are possible between homebrew assays for BCRABL transcript detection by quantitative real-time PCR, as shown in the study with a strong correlation coefficient of 0.9435 (p<0.00001) between paired results from two different laboratories using different methods."}
{"answers": "Although the exact mechanism of SSDH in this case is unclear, we speculate that this SSDH was a hematoma that migrated from the intracranial subdural space. Low CSF pressure because of continuous drainage and intrathecal thrombolytic therapy may have played an important role in the migration of the hematoma through the spinal canal. It is important to recognize the SSDH as a possible complication of the SAH accompanied with intracranial subdural hematoma.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the case study suggests that spinal subdural hematoma can be a sequela of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm, specifically in the case of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)."}
{"answers": "LAA occlusion device resulted in a slightly movement in QRS axis, reduced HR and increased the mean-mean QT interval duration. In addition, LA diameter and ARD seemed to be larger after device implantation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, LAA occlusion device alters echocardiography and electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). The study found that after LAA occlusion, there was a slight and measureable movement of QRS electric axis, and significant differences were observed in heart rate (HR) and the mean-mean QT interval between pre- and post-operation for all patients. Additionally, echocardiographic parameters were not significantly different between pre- and post-operation, but a larger LA diameter was detected during follow-up visits at 6 and 12 months, and a larger aortic root diameter (ARD) was also observed during follow"}
{"answers": "The study results suggested that spinal cord untethering may be unnecessary in patients with MM who are undergoing scoliosis corrective surgery and do not present with clinical symptoms of a tethered cord, even though tethering is radiographically demonstrated.", "prediction_text": "Based on the study, untethering is not necessary prior to scoliosis correction in patients with myelomeningocele. The study found that no patient experienced neurological complications postoperatively, including new cranial nerve palsy, shunt malfunction, change in urological function, or upper extremity weakness/sensory loss."}
{"answers": "Under the conditions of this study, pulpotomy offered a viable alternative to root canal treatment for teeth with vital pulps in the short term. However, there is insufficient clinical evidence to consider this technique for the treatment of every permanent tooth. Nevertheless, it should be considered as a potential alternative approach to be further developed for future applications.", "prediction_text": "Based on the study, pulpotomy with ProRoot MTA\u00ae is a successful and durable treatment for premolar or molar teeth with vital pulps, with an estimated survival rate of 82% at 24 months without any complementary treatment. However, it is not considered a permanent treatment as two teeth required root canal treatment for pain control and one for prosthetic reasons."}
{"answers": "The site of access in our study does not appear to influence complications specifically neural injury or recurrence rates.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the site of endovenous access does not significantly influence early outcomes in the treatment of small saphenous varicose veins using endovenous laser ablation (EVLA)."}
{"answers": "Retinal haemorrhages following a convulsive episode are rare. Such a finding should trigger an extensive search for other reasons, including child abuse.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that retinal haemorrhages are not a common finding after convulsive episodes in children, and that a thorough investigation is warranted if they are present to rule out other potential causes."}
{"answers": "Clear and distinct differences between the two studied groups were found indicating the root of this increased confidence may have developed due to exposure to the Pathway program.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the Global Longitudinal Pathway (GLP) medical education curriculum has influenced medical students' skills and attitudes toward culturally diverse populations."}
{"answers": "In normal daily practice, only a small number of clinically important adenomas are missed. The problem of missed adenomas probably is being exaggerated.", "prediction_text": "Based on the study, it is estimated that only 1.3% of colorectal cancers may have been missed in the adenoma phase due to previous endoscopy."}
{"answers": "Emotional prosody, therefore, seems to be partially processed outside the focus of spatial attention. Whereas at early sensory processing stages spatial attention modulates the degree of emotional voice processing as a function of emotional valence, emotional prosody is processed outside of the focus of spatial attention at later processing stages.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the processing of affective prosody is influenced by spatial attention."}
{"answers": "Pancreas retransplantation is a safe procedure with acceptable graft survival that should be proposed to diabetic patients who have lost their primary graft.", "prediction_text": "Yes, pancreas retransplantation can be a successful option for diabetic patients who have lost their primary graft, with survival rates similar to those of the general population and no negative impact on kidney graft function and survival."}
{"answers": "Weekend hospitalization leads to delayed provision of intensive procedures and elevated 1-year mortality for elderly AMI patients. The existence of measurable differences in treatments raises questions regarding the efficacy of a single input regulation (e.g., mandated nurse staffing ratios) in enhancing the quality of weekend care. My results suggest that targeted financial incentives might be a more cost-effective policy response than broad regulation aimed at improving quality.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study finds that hospitals provide lower quality care on weekends. Weekend-admitted patients are less likely to receive immediate intensive cardiac procedures and experience higher rates of adverse health outcomes compared to weekday-admitted patients. Specifically, they are less likely to receive catheterization, angioplasty, and bypass surgery in the immediate post-admission period, and experience higher 1-year mortality and readmission rates with congestive heart failure."}
{"answers": "The presence of more than one virus in hospitalized children with ARI is very frequent but it does not seem to have a major clinical impact in terms of severity. However bacterial superinfection increases the severity of the disease course. On the contrary, pneumococcal vaccination plays a protective role.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that the number of detected viruses does not correlate with the severity of acute respiratory infection in children. However, bacterial superinfection was associated with increased severity, and pneumococcal vaccination was found to be a protective factor in terms of respiratory distress, PICU admission, clinical score, respiratory support requirement, and oxygen necessity."}
{"answers": "In our study, it was observed that although longer ETA was associated with longer hospitalization, ETA was not correlated with postoperative complications. Our results inclined toward the position that appendectomy can be performed as a semielective surgery.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, delayed surgery (ETA>24 hours) was not found to be a significant predictor of increased complications in patients with acute appendicitis."}
{"answers": "Fetal gender does not affect the risk of having an ED visit for asthma during pregnancy, and it is not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes among women who had an asthma-related ED during pregnancy.", "prediction_text": "No, fetal gender is not associated with emergency department visits for asthma during pregnancy, according to the study. The odds ratio for fetal gender was 1.01 (95% CI 0.85-1.19), indicating that there was no significant difference in the risk of ED visits for asthma between male and female fetuses."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that working exposure increases the risk or leads to the clinical manifestation of rotator cuff tears. Although a detailed analysis of individual physical exposure is not available yet, the statistical results indicate that rotator cuff tears must be taken into consideration as a result of ergonomic exposure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that rotator cuff tears are more common among males working in certain occupations, particularly those in agriculture and forestry, and the building industry."}
{"answers": "High-quality training, strict compliance with evidence-based guidelines, and thorough documentation is associated with significant reductions in CLABSIs. Mindful organizing may lead to a better understanding of what goes into a unit's ability to handle peak demands and sustain extraordinary performance in the long-term.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the zero central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) rate achieved in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of the Floating Hospital for Children at Tufts Medical Center is sustainable. The study found that the adoption of standardized care practices, including bundles and checklists, led to a significant reduction in CLABSI rates, which were maintained for over 370 days in 2012 and for over 600 days in the first quarter of 2013. Ongoing training, surveillance, and vigilance with catheter insertion and maintenance practices, as well as improved documentation, were identified"}
{"answers": "Ketamine sedation was successful and well tolerated in all cases. The use of atropine as an adjunct for intramuscular ketamine sedation in children significantly reduces hypersalivation and may lower the incidence of post-procedural vomiting. Atropine is associated with a higher incidence of a transient rash. No serious adverse events were noted.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, atropine is not necessary when using ketamine for sedation in children. The study found that atropine did not provide any additional benefits in terms of hypersalivation, side effect profile, parental/patient satisfaction, or procedural success rate compared to placebo. In fact, atropine was associated with a higher incidence of transient rash and a trend towards worse tolerance."}
{"answers": "Findings depict wandering and PNA as overlapping, but nonequivalent phenomena. Evidence supporting construct validity of wandering was more robust than that for PNA. Results have implications for accuracy in scientific and clinical detection and labeling of wandering and agitation.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that wandering and physically nonaggressive agitation (PNA) are not equivalent concepts, as they are distinct and separate constructs. While there is a significant correlation between wandering and PNA, they are not the same thing."}
{"answers": "An advance care planning model is feasible for community palliative care services. Quality audit processes are an essential component of the Model with documentation of advance care planning discussion established as an important outcome measure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the advance care planning model was found to be feasible in community palliative care settings in Victoria, Australia."}
{"answers": "The study allows us to determine that FB can move through the body but not towards the heart. The study also serves as a warning sign: in cases of prolonged histories of FB ingestion, imaging studies are mandatory before endoscopic examination.", "prediction_text": "Yes, foreign bodies (FB) can migrate through the body towards the heart, as described in the passage. The mechanisms involved in FB migration include the movement of FB through the mucosa, which can lead to extra-lumen migration, and the FB can then migrate through the blood vessels or lymphatic system to reach the heart."}
{"answers": "Although most players in the study believe that rugby headgear may prevent concussion, only a minority reported wearing it. Coaches tended to be less convinced than the players that rugby headgear can prevent concussion.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, the attitudes of players and coaches towards the use of protective headgear in rugby do not support the belief that it prevents concussion. While players tend to believe that headgear could prevent concussion, coaches are less convinced. Only a minority of players reported wearing headgear and few felt that its use should be made mandatory."}
{"answers": "Early oral intake is possible after laparotomy and colorectal resection. Thus, the laparoscopic surgeon's claim of early tolerated oral intake may not be unique to laparoscopy.", "prediction_text": "No, the study suggests that early postoperative oral intake does not have to be limited to laparoscopic surgery. The results show that patients who underwent laparotomy with either a colonic or ileal resection were able to resume a regular diet after resolution of ileus, regardless of the type of surgery they underwent."}
{"answers": "Both medial and lateral PTS were significantly steeper in failures of ACLR than the control group. Medial or lateral PTS \u22655\u00b0 was a new risk factor of ACLR failure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that failures of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) are associated with steep posterior tibial slopes (PTS). The medial and lateral PTS were measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and were found to be significantly steeper in the ACLR failure group compared to the control group. Specifically, the medial PTS of the ACLR failure group was 3.5\u00b0 \u00b1 2.5\u00b0, which was significantly steeper than the control group (6.1\u00b0 \u00b1 2.1\u00b0, P = 0.000). Similarly, the lateral PTS of the ACLR failure group"}
{"answers": "These results suggest the need to provide interventions that are specifically designed to increase awareness of potential stroke signs and symptoms and appropriate subsequent clinical actions.", "prediction_text": "Only 14% of elderly patients in the study correctly endorsed their intention to call 911 when presented with clinical scenarios suggestive of acute stroke."}
{"answers": "We conclude that routine CXR after bronchoscopy with TBB is necessary only in patients with symptoms suggestive of pneumothorax. In asymptomatic patients, pneumothorax is rare and usually small, so routine CXR is not necessary in this category of patients.", "prediction_text": "No, routine chest radiography after transbronchial biopsy is not necessary, as pneumothorax occurs in only 2.9% of cases and symptoms suggestive of pneumothorax are present in only 7% of cases."}
{"answers": "Early surfactant administration is associated with shorter duration of ventilation but does not appear to be significantly protective against CLD/mortality among premature infants. This may support the growing evidence for consideration of CPAP as an alternative to routine intubation and early surfactant administration. Further investigation from large randomized clinical trials is warranted to confirm these results.", "prediction_text": "The study found that early administration of surfactant within one hour of birth was associated with a lower rate of chronic lung disease (CLD) and mortality in premature infants, compared to late administration."}
{"answers": "The study supports the hypothesis that nurses' aides who were exposed to ETS at home during childhood have an increased risk of long-term sickness absence.", "prediction_text": "Yes, people who were exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) during childhood have an increased risk of long-term work disability due to neck pain, high back pain, low back pain, and any illness."}
{"answers": "We concluded that depiction of the superior wall of the mandibular canal cannot be improved by changing the thickness of images.", "prediction_text": "Changing the thickness of double-oblique computed tomography (CT) images can improve mandibular depiction in the mandibular molar region, with the highest value obtained at a thickness of 0.9 mm."}
{"answers": "Exclusive CRT approach is not safe to treat patients with low infiltrative rectal carcinoma.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that chemoradiation therapy (CRT) may not be a safe option for treating mid and low rectal tumors, as local recurrence occurred in a significant number of patients who achieved complete response (CR) after CRT."}
{"answers": "Random survival forests did not yield higher performance compared to Cox proportional hazards. We found improvement in prediction performance when coupling the genetic SNP score with clinical/demographic markers, which warrants further investigation.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that incorporating multiple single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) testing in BRCA1 and BRCA2 female carriers can improve the predictive ability of risk models in conjunction with clinical assessment, with average concordance index values of 0.221 and 0.215 for BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers, respectively."}
{"answers": "Bedtime NPH insulin added to maximal therapy with sulfonylurea and metformin is an effective, simple, well-tolerated approach for patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, continuing oral hypoglycemic agents in addition to starting insulin therapy may be a better approach than starting insulin monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes."}
{"answers": "PET data show that amoxapine's profile is very similar to that of the established atypical antipsychotics. These data, together with amoxapine's in vitro pharmacologic profile, effectiveness in animal models, and efficacy in psychotic depression raise the possibility of amoxapine as an \"atypical\" antipsychotic agent in the treatment of schizophrenia.", "prediction_text": "Based on the study, amoxapine is not an atypical antipsychotic as it does not meet the criteria mentioned in the question. The study found that amoxapine has high serotonin (5-HT)2 occupancy, greater 5-HT2 than dopamine (D)2 occupancy, and a higher incidence of extrapyramidal side effects when its D2 occupancy exceeds 80%. These findings are inconsistent with the definition of atypical antipsychotics, which are characterized by low to moderate D2 occupancy and high 5-HT2 occupancy."}
{"answers": "In gravid ewes, intravenous infusion of<or = 1.67 micrograms/min epinephrine altered neither maternal hemodynamics nor uterine blood flow. To the extent that sheep data can be extrapolated to humans, these results suggest that continuous intravenous infusion of epinephrine in local anesthetic solutions is safe if the epidural catheter should enter a blood vessel during the infusion.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a continuous intravenous infusion of low-concentration epinephrine (0.125% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 or 1:400,000 epinephrine) impairs uterine blood flow in pregnant ewes, decreasing it to 68 +/- 14% of baseline."}
{"answers": "These data indicate that major blunt trauma enhances the migratory capacity of circulating neutrophils. This is manifest within 2 hrs of admission and may be attributable to alteration in interleukin-8 receptor expression, affinity, or downstream signaling. In patients who later develop ARDS, initially elevated circulating neutrophil counts decrease rapidly, over the same time course. Early enhanced neutrophil migratory activity coupled with elevated pulmonary concentrations of interleukin-8 may be central to the establishment of the neutrophil infiltration that is characteristic of ARDS.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that increased neutrophil migratory activity after major trauma may play a role in the etiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The study found that neutrophils isolated from trauma patients exhibited an enhanced migratory response to high concentrations of interleukin-8 throughout the first 24 hours after admission, compared to normal volunteers. This suggests that the early inflammatory response to trauma may contribute to the development of ARDS by promoting the recruitment of neutrophils to the lungs."}
{"answers": "Memory provocation increased the sensitivity of rCBF-SPECT for the detection of AD-related blood flow changes in the brain at the group level. Further studies are needed to evaluate MP-SPECT as a diagnostic tool at the individual level. If a higher sensitivity for AD at the individual level is verified in future studies, a single MP-SPECT study might be sufficient in the clinical setting.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that memory-provoked rCBF-SPECT (MP-SPECT) may have a higher diagnostic sensitivity than resting rCBF-SPECT in differentiating between Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and healthy controls, with a significant reduction in left parietal cortex rCBF observed in AD patients during the memory provocation task."}

{"answers": "Right ventricular recovery following PVR for chronic significant pulmonary regurgitation after repair of TOF may be compromised in the adult population. In order to maintain adequate RV contractility, pulmonary valve implant in these patients should be considered before RV function deteriorates.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) in adults late after repair of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) may not be performed at the optimal time, as there was no significant change in right ventricular (RV) volume and function after the operation."}
{"answers": "Combined approach tympanoplasty (CAT) allows for successful treatment of cholesteatoma with rates of recurrent and residual disease comparable to open mastoid surgery. Early timing of second-look procedures allows easier removal of any recurrent or residual disease, which reduces the conversion rate to open mastoidectomy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, early second-look tympanoplasty can reduce the rate of conversion to modified radical mastoidectomy."}
{"answers": "In 1995, the first year that the MQSA was in effect, there was a significant improvement in the quality of mammography in North Carolina. This improvement probably resulted from facilities' compliance with federal regulations.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the implementation of the MQSA in 1992 had a significant positive impact on the quality of mammography in North Carolina, as the percentage of facilities meeting quality standards increased and the passing rates for phantom image evaluation, darkroom fog, and temperature difference improved from the first to the second inspection."}
{"answers": "HIE was associated with reduced repeat imaging in EDs. This study is among the first to find empirical support for this anticipated benefit of HIE.", "prediction_text": "Yes, health information exchange (HIE) was associated with a reduction in redundant imaging in emergency departments (EDs), as shown by decreased probabilities of repeat CT, ultrasound, and chest x-ray imaging within 30 days of the initial imaging study. The reduction in redundant imaging was found to be 44%-67% relative to the sample means."}
{"answers": "Gestational age misclassification is an unlikely explanation for the reported divergence in average birth-weights for Aborigines and whites. The results might help with the interpretation of other between-population comparisons.", "prediction_text": "No, gestational age misclassification does not explain the difference in birthweights for Australian Aborigines and whites."}
{"answers": "W-d HCCs were clinically demonstrated not to be early cancer, because there was no significant difference in disease free survival between the patients with w-d and l-d HCCs.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that well-differentiated small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may not be clinically early cancer, as there is no significant difference in the disease-free survival between well-differentiated and less differentiated HCCs."}
{"answers": "The incidence of post-tonsillectomy late haemorrhage in our study population was 1.78%. A statistically significant difference was found between night-time and day-time haemorrhages.

{"answers": "Biased estimates of asthma severity may contribute to racially disparate asthma care. Interventions to improve physicians' assessments of asthma severity and patient-physician communication may minimize racial disparities in asthma care.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that physician estimates of asthma severity were less accurate in black patients compared to white patients. Specifically, black patients were more likely to have their asthma severity underestimated by their physicians."}
{"answers": "Many factors contribute to the erroneous reporting of hCG results, including (a) the complexity of hCG molecule and confusion of nomenclature on the various forms of hCG; (b) laboratory personnel's lack of awareness of the distinctions of the forms of hCG and failure to recognize the specificity of assays for their measurement; (c) lack of clarity and uniformity in manufacturers' reagent labeling; and (d) most product inserts' lack of information on the specificity of each method to the various forms of hCG.", "prediction_text": "No, laboratories are not reporting serum quantitative hCG results correctly. The study found errors in the reporting of intact hCG results as total beta hCG (9.3%) and total beta hCG as intact hCG (13.1%)."}
{"answers": "This study has shown that mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons concerning a certain issue is not sufficient to lead to a change in practice.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no significant change in the use of prophylactic nasogastric decompression in elective colonic resections after surgeons were familiarized with current evidence through a summary mailing."}
{"answers": "These data suggest that either apoptosis is not involved in cell loss in MTS, or a very slow rate of cell demise may have precluded detecting TUNEL-positive neurons dying through apoptosis. Increased Bax expression and activation of caspases support the latter possibility.", "prediction_text": "The study found that there is no evidence for DNA fragmentation by TUNEL staining or typical apoptotic changes in nuclear morphology in the temporal lobe specimens from patients with mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS), suggesting that the cell death in MTS is not primarily apoptotic."}
{"answers": "Golytely was more efficacious than MiraLAX in bowel cleansing, and was independently associated with both bowel prep quality (BBPS \u2265 7) and higher adenoma detection. Golytely should be used as first line for bowel prep for colonoscopy. Studies with larger populations are needed to confirm these results.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant difference in the adenoma detection rate between MiraLAX and Golytely, with a higher rate of adenoma detection detected in the Golytely group."}
{"answers": "Patient's age (>60 y) and large polyp size (>10 mm) were significant predictive factors for neoplastic GB polyps. GB polyps less than 10 mm in diameter do not require surgical intervention simply because they grow.", "prediction_text": "The growth rate of a gallbladder polyp cannot predict a neoplastic polyp with certainty. However, older age and larger size of the polyp are associated with a higher likelihood of neoplastic polyps."}
{"answers": "These data suggest that the R14C KCNQ1 mutation alone is insufficient to cause AF. Rather, we suggest a model in which a \"second hit\", such as an environmental factor like hypertension, which promotes atrial stretch and thereby unmasks an inherited defect in ion channel kinetics (the \"first hit\"), is required for AF to be manifested. Such a model would also account for the age-related increase in AF development.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that a stretch-sensitive KCNQ1 mutation may play a role in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation, linking genetic and environmental factors."}
{"answers": "The real-time PCR approach revealed promising results in pollen identification and quantification, even when analyzing pollen mixes.

The incidence of confined placental mosaicism was lower in IVF/ICSI pregnancies compared to spontaneous conceptions, and the incidence of fetal chromosomal anomalies was increased in IVF/ICSI pregnancies, but these differences were not statistically significant."}
{"answers": "For risk stratification in emergency surgical patients, it is essential to measure the APACHE II score before surgical treatment. Longitudinal APACHE II scoring reveals continuous improvement of the score in surviving patients but has no therapeutic relevance in the individual patient.", "prediction_text": "The APACHE II score is not a reliable marker of physiological impairment in emergency surgical patients, as it is influenced by treatment and monitoring in the ICU, leading to bias in comparisons between groups and evaluation of treatment policies."}
{"answers": "The methodologic weaknesses of the studies do not permit acceptance of increased risk of tubal pregnancy or infertility as a consequence of perforation of the appendix, so a causal relationship cannot be supported by the data currently available. Only a well-designed case-control study with unbiased ascertainment of exposure and adjustment for confounding variables will provide a definitive answer.", "prediction_text": "The evidence suggests that perforation of the appendix may be associated with an increased risk of tubal infertility and ectopic pregnancy, although the estimates of risk vary widely across studies and are affected by limitations in study design and reporting."}
{"answers": "Cancellous bone plays an important role in primary stability of mini-implants in the presence or absence of cortical bone.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that trabecular bone is related to primary stability of miniscrews. Lower levels of primary stability were observed when the bone mineral density (BMD) of trabecular bone was lower and when cortical bone was absent. Trabecular number, thickness, bone volume density, and cortical thickness were found to be correlated with primary stability."}
{"answers": "Despite recent efforts, a large proportion of newly confirmed TB patients could not adhere to standard TB treatment, and patients' lost to follow-up was still a serious problem. Poor treatment supervision and heavy financial burden might be the main causes for non-adherence. More needs to be done to enhance treatment supervision policies and financial supports to both health providers and TB patients.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, only 36.0% of tuberculosis patients in China adhered to their prescribed treatments, while 28.2% lost to follow-up during the treatment course."}
{"answers": "While not providing conclusive evidence, this single institution experience suggests that neoadjuvant chemotherapy for Stage IV NPC patients improves both survival and disease control.

Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings.", "prediction_text": "Yes, prior benign prostate biopsy predicts improved outcome for patients treated with radical perineal prostatectomy. Patients with prior benign biopsies had more favorable pathologic features, including more organ-confined and less margin-positive disease, and lower probability of biochemical failure compared to those without prior biopsies."}
{"answers": "This clinical trial evaluated the possible reduction in intervention-related myocardial damage that was attributable to remote postischemic conditioning.", "prediction_text": "Remote postischemic conditioning does not provide significant protection against ischemic damage in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), including those with diabetes."}
{"answers": "These results indicate that prophylactic treatment with edaravone prevents I/R-induced ovarian damage during pneumoperitoneum in an experimental rat model.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that edaravone offers protection against ischemia/reperfusion-induced ovarian damage in rats."}
{"answers": "Sonography has no place in the diagnosis of undescended testis.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that ultrasonography may not be a reliable method for detecting undescended testes in boys, as it did not detect retractile testes and missed 33% of palpable undescended testes. Therefore, it may not be worthwhile to perform ultrasonography in boys with undescended testes."}
{"answers": "Mammographic density is not associated with an increased need for re-excision or resection of unnecessary margins at initial BCS.", "prediction_text": "No, mammographic density does not have a significant impact on the margin re-excision rate after breast-conserving surgery."}
{"answers": "Septal suturing after septoplasty offers the following advantages: elimination of discomfort for the patients, minimal complications, the outcome is almost the same as with nasal packing, and finally the hospital stay is less than with nasal packing. Therefore, suturing of the nasal septum after septoplasty should be a preferred alternative to nasal packing.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that suturing the nasal septum after septoplasty is not an effective alternative to nasal packing in terms of reducing postoperative complications such as oozing, bleeding, and septal hematoma."}
{"answers": "The present study does not support the recommendation of ultrasound as a conclusive diagnostic tool for internal derangements of the temporomandibular joint.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that ultrasound has limited diagnostic value in detecting internal derangements of the temporomandibular joint, with lower sensitivity compared to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Therefore, ultrasound may not be a reliable method for diagnosing internal derangements of the temporomandibular joint."}
{"answers": "Our results showed that the serum leptin level has no prognostic indications in advanced lung cancer patients. Leptin is decreased in lung cancer, and there is lack of correlation with tumour\u2011related factors including prognosis. Therefore, leptin is not a useful clinical marker in lung cancer (Tab. 2, Fig. 2, Ref. 22).", "prediction_text": "No, serum leptin levels are not a prognostic factor in advanced lung cancer."}
{"answers": "We found no evidence of serovar specific immunity in our population. It remains possible that populations with a higher prevalence of gonorrhoea and more frequent infections may have a quantitatively greater immune response.", "prediction_text": "The study found no evidence of serovar-specific immunity to Neisseria gonorrhoeae, as the prevalence of serovars isolated following a repeat infection was not significantly different from those without repeat infections."}
{"answers": "BPPV is associated with positive viral serology, particularly during certain months of the year, mainly in spring and autumn. Viral infection might promote BPPV attacks due to the development of vestibulopathy or induce secondary BPPV via viral infection-related neurolabyrinthitis.", "prediction_text": "Yes, viral infections play a role in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV)."}
{"answers": "We found increased post-ictal serum cytokine levels in patients with several epilepsy syndromes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that cytokines play a role in epilepsy. The levels of several cytokines (TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6) were found to be elevated in the serum of patients with epilepsy compared to healthy controls. Additionally, there was a correlation between certain cytokine levels and specific epilepsy syndromes or seizure types. However, serial analysis during the seizure-free period revealed a decrease in cytokine levels in some patients, suggesting that these molecules may play a role in the pathophysiology of epilepsy but"}
{"answers": "Neuromedin U reduces insulin and increases somatostatin secretion. Blockade of somatostatin action abolishes the inhibition of insulin secretion by NmU. The results of the study suggest that somatostatin mediates the inhibitory action of NmU on insulin secretion.", "prediction_text": "Yes, somatostatin confers insulinostatic effects of neuromedin U in the rat pancreas."}
{"answers": "Patients with fewer or anterior sutures have shorter OR times. However, 30-day readmission, band-related reoperation, and postoperative weight loss were unaffected by number or location of suture. The technical aspects of HHR did not appear to be associated with readmission or reoperation, and therefore a standardized approach may not be necessary.", "prediction_text": "The location and number of sutures used for hiatal hernia repair during laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) do matter, with differences in operating room time and length of stay (LOS) depending on the number of sutures used. Specifically, patients with one suture had shorter OR time, while those with posterior suture had longer LOS. There was no significant difference in other outcomes such as readmission, reoperation, and postoperative BMI/%EWL."}
{"answers": "Survivors of lobar ICH with atrial fibrillation should not be offered long-term anticoagulation. Similarly, most patients with deep hemispheric ICH and atrial fibrillation should not receive anticoagulant therapy. However, patients with deep hemispheric ICH at particularly high risk for thromboembolic stroke or low risk of ICH recurrence might benefit from long-term anticoagulation.", "prediction_text": "The decision to anticoagulate patients with a history of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is complex and depends on various factors. According to the study, withholding anticoagulation therapy is preferred for patients with a history of lobar ICH, as it can improve quality-adjusted life expectancy by 1.9 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). However, for patients with a history of deep hemispheric ICH, withholding anticoagulation results in a smaller gain of 0.3 QALYs. In sensitivity analyses, anticoagulation"}
{"answers": "This study showed that FDG is not a good surrogate tracer for tumor hypoxia under either ambient or hypoxic conditions. Only specific hypoxia tracers should be used to measure tumor hypoxia.", "prediction_text": "No, the study suggests that (18)F-FDG is not a reliable surrogate tracer to measure tumor hypoxia. The study found that under normoxic conditions, there was a decreasing similarity between (14)C-EF3 and (18)F-FDG with higher activity sub-volumes, and under hypoxic conditions, the similarity between the two tracers decreased even further. The Dice similarity index (DSI) values obtained from the AR images were lower for (18)F-FDG compared to (14)C-EF3, indicating that (18)F-FDG is not a reliable surrogate tracer for"}

{"answers": "Orthostatic myoclonus is often underdiagnosed and can be considered a possible cause of unsteadiness in subjects with neurodegenerative diseases. Electromyography surface recording is thereby an aid for investigating unsteadiness of unknown origin.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that orthostatic myoclonus (OM) is an underrecognized cause of unsteadiness in neurodegenerative diseases."}
{"answers": "Severely injured patients treated at a level III center had a higher mortality rate than those treated at a level I center. Most problems identified occurred in the emergency department and were related to delays in care provision. This research highlights the importance of efficient prehospital, in-hospital, and regional trauma systems, performance monitoring, peer review, and adherence to protocols and guidelines.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the level of trauma center providing treatment to severely injured adult trauma patients in an Australian health service makes a significant difference in terms of mortality and hospital length of stay. Specifically, patients who presented to a level III trauma center had a higher risk of death compared to those who presented to a level I trauma center, after controlling for various factors such as age, sex, Injury Severity Score (ISS), and prehospital time. Additionally, peer review of deaths at the level III center identified problems in care delivery in 15 cases, including technical errors, delay in decision making, and errors of judgment."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that very few genes, which change their expression level during the WOI, show a quantitative homogeneous expression in endometrially-receptive patients. In conclusion, in this study only six genes showed a homogeneous expression, and are probably involved in embryo implantation mechanisms.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no uniform basal endometrial gene expression profile during the implantation window in women who became pregnant in a subsequent ICSI cycle. Only 6 out of 43 genes analyzed showed a statistically uniform expression among patients who subsequently became pregnant."}
{"answers": "While SSA would be the first region to experience the huge benefits of implementing the \"test and treat\" policy of the WHO, the region is not yet prepared to manage the consequential increased burden of ART-related toxic and metabolic complications. Urgent measures should be taken to fill the lacunae if SSA is not to become over-burdened by the consequences of the \"test and treat\" policy.", "prediction_text": "Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is unlikely to cope effectively with the increased incidence of antiretroviral therapy (ART) related adverse effects resulting from the new \"test and treat\" policy of the World Health Organization (WHO). The region faces significant challenges in terms of poverty, weak health systems, inadequate health services, lack of qualified personnel, and inaccessibility to medicines, which will exacerbate the situation. Additionally, there is a lack of data on the incidence and predictive factors of ART-related adverse effects in SSA, making it difficult to prepare an adequate response plan."}
{"answers": "In summary we believe sudden onset chest wall rigidity may be a significant and previously unreported factor leading to an increased mortality, from illicit IV fentanyl use. Fentanyl and norfentanyl ratios and concentrations suggest a more rapid onset of death given the finding of fentanyl without norfentanyl in many of the fatalities. Chest wall rigidity may help explain the cause of death in these instances, in contrast to the typical opioid-related overdose deaths. Intravenous heroin users should be educated regarding this potentially fatal complication given the increasingly common substitution and combination with heroin of fentanyl.", "prediction_text": "Yes, chest wall rigidity could be a factor in rapid death from illicit fentanyl abuse, as the study found that rapid intravenous administration of fentanyl can produce chest wall rigidity."}
{"answers": "There appears to be no benefit in metformin co-treatment before and during IVF in women with PCO without any other features of PCOS. Clinical Trials.gov: NCT01046032.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that short-term metformin co-treatment during IVF does not improve live birth rates or reduce severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) in women with ovaries of polycystic morphology without any other features of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)."}
{"answers": "The study suggests that ventilating an adult patient is possible with a smaller, pediatric-sized BVM. The tidal volumes recorded with the pediatric BVM were more consistent with lung-protective ventilation volumes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, EMS providers can provide appropriate tidal volumes in a simulated adult-sized patient with a pediatric-sized bag-valve-mask (BVM). The study found that the pediatric BVM provided lower median tidal volumes compared to the adult BVM in all three categories of airway devices, with a significant difference in all scenarios (p<0.001). Only 1.5% of breaths delivered with the pediatric BVM were below the recommended tidal volume, while a greater percentage of breaths were delivered in the recommended range when the pediatric BVM was used."}
{"answers": "Our results suggest that colonoscopy does not affect the management of patients with acute diverticulitis nor alter the outcome. The current practice of a routine colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis, diagnosed by typical clinical symptoms and CT needs to be reevaluated.", "prediction_text": "No, a colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis does not significantly affect its management."}
{"answers": "Pretreatment ECG is of limited value for patients with an unremarkable cardiovascular history and a normal heart rate and blood pressure. Hypotension may occur during treatment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, cardiovascular evaluation is necessary prior to and during beta-blocker therapy for infantile hemangiomas. The study found that while there were no serious complications or contraindications to therapy, 6.5% of patients had ECG abnormalities and 9 patients experienced hypotension that did not require therapy adjustment. Additionally, 81% of parents reported side effects during treatment."}
{"answers": "Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is a promising option for lifelong treatment of type 2 diabetes. It has the potential to improve or cure a selected spectrum of type 1 diabetes when performed early in the disease. Further animal model studies or randomized controlled trials are needed to support our conclusion.", "prediction_text": "The current evidence suggests that Roux-en-Y gastric bypass can provide a lifelong solution for diabetes mellitus in some patients with type 2 diabetes, but more research is needed to confirm this for patients with type 1 diabetes."}
{"answers": "Collectively, results suggest that behavioral adaptation to ESC is likely in certain drivers; however, its proven effectiveness in reducing the likelihood of being involved in a serious crash probably outweighs any potential increases in unsafe driving. To fully benefit from ESC, vehicle manufacturers are encouraged to market ESC-equipped vehicles in a realistic, safe manner. Driver training and safety organizations are also encouraged to provide balanced educational information about ESC to their members.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that the widespread introduction of ESC into the Canadian vehicle fleet could lead to behavioral adaptation and changes in driving behavior among drivers."}
{"answers": "The results of the study demonstrate that when clinical supervision uses best practice principles, it can provide professional support for allied health workers, even during times of rapid organisational change.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that clinical supervision can be effective in improving the perceived effectiveness of allied health professionals in the Australian health context. The length, number, and total duration of supervision sessions, as well as certain individual variables, were found to be significantly positively correlated with the effectiveness of clinical supervision. These findings suggest that clinical supervision can be a valuable tool in supporting and developing the skills of allied health professionals, particularly when it is of a sufficient duration and frequency. However, the study did not specifically address the sustainability of clinical supervision in the current healthcare landscape, and further research is needed to fully understand its impact in this regard."}
{"answers": "Both 'economic/employment' and 'social/welfare' dimensions of social exclusion significantly influence suicide mortality among males. The influence of 'economic/employment' and 'social/welfare' dimensions of social exclusion on female suicide mortality is controversial. Social exclusion might be considered as a risk factor for suicide mortality in Europe.", "prediction_text": "Yes, some aspects of social exclusion, specifically the \"economic/employment\" and \"social/welfare\" dimensions, are found to influence suicide mortality among both males and females in Europe."}
{"answers": "While ultrasound examination is inexpensive and easily done, it is not accurate enough for staging small penile cancers located at the glans penis. However, for larger tumors ultrasound can be a useful addition to physical examination by delineating reliably the anatomic relations of the tumor to structures such as the tunica albuginea, corpus cavernosum, and urethra.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that ultrasound examination can be a useful addition to clinical staging in squamous cell carcinoma of the penis, particularly in assessing the invasion into the corpora. However, it is not able to differentiate between invasion of the subepithelial tissue and invasion into the corpus spongiosum."}
{"answers": "This study confirms that a large percentage of patients use metered-dose inhalers improperly. It also demonstrates a significant lack of understanding by health care providers of the proper use of metered-dose inhalers. Furthermore, this study supports the use of respiratory care practitioners in the outpatient setting, since they were the most proficient among all the health care providers in the proper use of metered-dose inhalers.", "prediction_text": "Health care providers, including house staff, nurses, and respiratory care practitioners, have limited proficiency in the proper use of metered-dose inhalers, and patients have a poor understanding of the technique used with these devices."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrated that the regional or global apex of a given curve is the most rotated level in only a minority of the curves. The most rotated level may be as far as two levels from the global apex and one level from the regional apex.", "prediction_text": "No, the transverse apex (most rotated vertebral level) does not always coincide with the coronal apex levels (regional or global) in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. The study found that the regional and global apex levels were at the same level in 54.5% of curves, within half a level in 45.4%, and one level higher in 2% of curves. There was a higher variability in the difference between the most rotated levels and the regional and global apex levels, extending up to two levels for the global apex."}
{"answers": "Generalization of the RCT sample was supported, because only 7.8% of Phenomenology subjects did not fit the RCT criteria. Nevertheless, because the RCT subjects were more severely ill, it is unclear if treatment findings from the RCT will be applicable to children with less severe mania.", "prediction_text": "The \"Treatment of Early Age Mania (TEAM)\" sample does not generalize well to the diagnostic characteristics of child bipolar I disorder. The study found that the TEAM sample had a higher prevalence of mania symptoms, ultradian rapid cycling, psychosis, and suicidality compared to the sample obtained through consecutive new case ascertainment (Phenomenology study)."}
{"answers": "Experts across Europe asserted the right to culturally sensitive health care for all immigrants. There is a broad consensus among experts about the major principles of good practice that need to be implemented across Europe.

The study found 9 themes that were consistently identified as important across all 16 participating countries, including:"}
{"answers": "Biochemical analysis of injured cervical intervertebral disks reveals the presence of inflammatory markers such as MCP, fragments of structural matrix proteins such as FAC, and a correlation with pH. Further evaluation of the FAC as a potential diagnostic biomarker or therapeutic target is warranted in the cervical spine.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the fibronectin-aggrecan complex (FAC) is present in cervical disk disease. The study found a statistically significant correlation between the FAC and pH in the lavage fluid obtained from the disk space before surgical treatment for cervical radiculopathy caused by disk herniation."}
{"answers": "Affect-regulated exercise to feel 'good' can be used in a training programme to regulate exercise intensity. This approach led to a 19% increase in time to reach ventilatory threshold, which is indicative of improved fitness.", "prediction_text": "Yes, training at an intensity that feels \"good\" through affect-regulated exercise can lead to improved fitness, as shown by the significant increase in time to reach ventilatory threshold in the training group compared to the control group."}
{"answers": "In Southern Italy, hepatitis G virus infection is widespread among patients with chronic hepatitis, independently of parenteral risk factors. Its frequency in subjects with cryptogenic liver disease parallels that observed in hepatitis C virus chronic liver disease, thus ruling out an aetiologic role of hepatitis G virus. TT virus infection is uncommon in patients with cryptogenic or hepatitis C virus-related liver disease who do not have a history of parenteral exposure.", "prediction_text": "The study found that hepatitis G virus and TT virus infection is not significantly involved in cryptogenic chronic liver disease."}
{"answers": "Our findings suggest that somatic complaints may represent one, but not necessarily the most important, risk factor for the subsequent development of depressive symptoms in women in nonclinical populations. The results also highlight the importance of including social variables in studies on women's depression as well as conducting additional research to further examine predictors of depressive symptoms in men.", "prediction_text": "Yes, somatic complaints (assessed using the SCL-90-R somatization subscale) predict subsequent symptoms of depressed mood in women, but not in men, in an initially healthy cohort of community adults over a 5-year period."}
{"answers": "Peak inspiratory pressure, PEEP, and ventilation index values could distinguish survivors from nonsurvivors by day 3. This may assist in early application of supportive nonconventional therapies in children with malignancy and ARDS.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that certain respiratory parameters, such as peak inspiratory pressure, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and ventilation index, can predict outcome in children with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and malignancy. Specifically, higher values of these parameters on day 3 of mechanical ventilation were associated with a lower chance of survival. Additionally, the study found that respiratory data, such as PaO2/FiO2 and P(A-a)O2, can predict outcome related to efficiency of oxygenation from day 8 after onset of mechanical ventilation."}
{"answers": "In this small study serum inhibin concentrations higher than those found in the early follicular phase one to two weeks after evacuation of a hydatidiform mole seemed to be specific for persistent trophoblastic disease. Further data are needed to confirm these promising results.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that inhibin may be a useful new circulating marker for the diagnosis and monitoring of hydatidiform mole. The concentrations of inhibin in serum and tissue were found to be significantly higher in patients with hydatidiform mole compared to normal pregnant women, and the levels decreased significantly after evacuation of the mole. Additionally, the study found that serum inhibin concentrations less than 0.4 U/ml after evacuation were associated with a low risk of persistent trophoblastic disease."}
{"answers": "The integration of whole-lesion dynamic data tends to improve specificity. However, no statistical significance backs up this finding.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, analysis of the whole lesion time curve distribution is not necessary for accurate diagnosis of malignant vs benign lesions in MR-mammography (MRM) using CAD software."}
{"answers": "The seemingly exaggerated traditional fear of anaphylaxis seems to discourage surgeons from more widely adopting minimal access techniques for the treatment of hydatid cyst.", "prediction_text": "Yes, fear of anaphylactic shock is a significant discouragement for surgeons in adopting percutaneous and laparoscopic techniques in the treatment of liver hydatid cysts."}
{"answers": "Grandmultiparous women had increased maternal and neonatal morbidity, and neonatal mortality even after controlling for confounders, suggesting a need for closer observation than regular multiparous patients during labor and delivery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, grandmultiparity is an independent risk factor for several adverse perinatal outcomes, including abruptio placentae, preterm delivery, fetal macrosomia, neonatal death, postpartum hemorrhage, and blood transfusion."}
{"answers": "No single data source is likely to provide a complete health profile for an individual. For women with depression in pregnancy and dispensed antidepressants, the hospital admission data do not adequately capture all cases.", "prediction_text": "No, women with major depression in pregnancy are not identifiable in population health data using the methods described in the study. The study found that only 13.6% of pregnant women who were dispensed antidepressants had depression recorded as a comorbidity on their hospital records, indicating that the majority of women with depression during pregnancy were not identified through this method. Additionally, the study found that only 80% of women who were dispensed antidepressants had depression recorded in their hospital records, suggesting that there may be under-ascertainment of depression in the data. The study concluded that the prevalence of depression in this population of pregn"}
{"answers": "These data suggest a pattern of diagnostic stability over time for manic and mixed episodes in patients with bipolar disorder. Careful prospective studies of this issue are needed.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the distribution of manic and mixed episodes in patients with bipolar disorder does not run true over time, as episodes were more consistent than would be expected by chance."}
{"answers": "The analyses show that structural characteristics of a practice are not associated with uptake of a new IT facility, but that its use may be influenced by post-graduate education in the relevant clinical condition. For this diabetes system at least, practice nurse use was critical in spreading uptake beyond initial GP enthusiasts and for sustained and rising use in subsequent years.", "prediction_text": "Yes, general practice characteristics, such as total list size, training status, numbers of GPs, mean age of the GPs, numbers of female GPs, and level of deprivation of the population, were found to influence the uptake of an IT innovation in primary care. Specifically, practices with more diabetes-educated staff were associated with increased use of the IT system by both nurses and GPs."}
{"answers": "GAPS, a simple clinical score, is a better predictor of admission than triage nurses, unless the nurse is sure about the outcome, in which case their clinical judgement should be respected.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that nurses are better than a simple objective score, such as the GAPS, in predicting admission at triage. The study found that while GAPS had a similar discrimination as nurses, it was significantly worse than nurses in terms of calibration and accuracy, especially in the majority of attendances where nurses were less certain of the outcome. When the GAPS was \"over-ruled\" and used in conjunction with clinical certainty, it significantly outperformed both methods."}
{"answers": "Our data showed no difference in 25(OH) D levels between normal children and those with CD when adjusted for body mass index.", "prediction_text": "No, vitamin D deficiency is not a feature of pediatric celiac disease in prepubertal children, according to this study. There was no significant difference in vitamin D levels between children with celiac disease and non-celiac children, and when the patients were subdivided into obese and non-obese groups, the non-obese celiac patients had a higher vitamin D level than the obese normal children."}
{"answers": "Granulomatous myelotoxicity and enteritis developed in a 21 year old female within 3 weeks of initiating sulfasalazine for rheumatoid arthritis. Following a short course of corticosteroids, the patient had resolution of her cholestatic hepatitis, rash, eosinophilia, and gastrointestinal symptoms with no residual manifestations at 7 months follow-up. Although severe reactions to sulfasalazine are rare and unpredictable, practicing physicians should be aware of unusual clinical presentations of toxicity when prescribing sulfasalazine.", "prediction_text": "No, the patient in the medical paper does not have Crohn's disease. The patient is described as having rheumatoid arthritis, which is a different inflammatory condition."}
{"answers": "Healthy lifestyles lead to an increase in the utilization of preventive health services. However, there is not much significantly reducing the number of outpatient visits in people with health behaviors. Specifically, people with regular exercise habits and who take their blood pressure measurement regularly have an increased number of outpatient visits. It is suggested that more available and accessible health consultation services be provided to inculcate in the general public the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle.", "prediction_text": "Yes, this study suggests that individuals with healthier lifestyles tend to utilize healthcare resources less. Specifically, the study found that individuals who engage in regular exercise, have healthy dietary habits, measure their blood pressure regularly, and drink alcohol in moderation tend to visit the doctor and undergo health examinations less frequently compared to those with unhealthier lifestyles."}
{"answers": "Parental restriction of R-rated movie viewing is associated with both lower adolescent smoking susceptibility and lower smoking rates.", "prediction_text": "Yes, parental restriction of R-rated movie viewing is associated with lower adolescent smoking susceptibility.

{"answers": "Having a usual physician can be an effective tool in improving access to care for low-income populations, although it is most effective when combined with insurance coverage. However, the effectiveness of managed care in linking more low-income persons to a medical home is uncertain, and may have unintended consequences for uninsured persons.", "prediction_text": "No, managed care does not enable more low-income persons to identify a usual source of care. In fact, the study found that high managed care penetration in the community is associated with a lower likelihood of having a usual source of care for uninsured persons."}
{"answers": "Locally 1.0% ropivacaine administration significantly relieves the pain of pediatric tonsillectomy and, it is a safe and effective method. High concentrations of ropivaciane may produce clinically significant pain relief. It is more effective to reduce of post-operative analgesic requirement after first hour.", "prediction_text": "Topical ropivacaine hydrochloride does not significantly reduce post-tonsillectomy morbidity in pediatric patients, at least in the first hour after surgery. However, there was a statistically significant difference in pain relief between the ropivacaine and control groups in the later hours and days after surgery."}
{"answers": "Minimally invasive mitral valve repair using neochords provided a high rate of repair, reproducible results in a routine cardiac surgery setting and stable repair during follow-up. This has become our preferred technique for mitral valve surgery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, minimally invasive mitral valve repair with artificial chords is reproducible and applicable in routine surgery, based on the study's findings."}
{"answers": "Comparisons of absolute EOA values grouped by the manufacturers' valve sizes are misleading because of specific differences in geometric dimensions. The EOA:patient aortic annulus area ratio provides a new hemodynamic index which may facilitate objective comparisons between different valve types.", "prediction_text": "The effective orifice area/patient aortic annulus area ratio is a better way to compare different bioprostheses in terms of their hemodynamic performance."}

{"answers": "A reduced alveolar macrophage phagocytic host response to apoptotic cells or NTHi may contribute to neutrophilic inflammation and NTHi colonization in both PBB and bronchiectasis. Whether this mechanism also contributes to the progression of PBB to bronchiectasis remains unknown.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that alveolar macrophage phagocytic dysfunction is a forerunner to bronchiectasis in children with protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB). The study found that children with PBB or bronchiectasis had significantly lower macrophage phagocytic capacity compared to control subjects, and this reduction was associated with reduced expression of phagocytic scavenger receptors and increased inflammation in the airways. These findings suggest that impaired macrophage function may be an early event in the development of bronchiectasis."}
{"answers": "Cervical physical therapy can have a positive effect on subjective tinnitus complaints in patients with a combination of tinnitus and neck complaints. Larger studies, using more responsive outcome measures, are however necessary to prove this effect.", "prediction_text": "Yes, multi-modal cervical physical therapy improves tinnitus in patients with cervicogenic somatic tinnitus (CST)."}
{"answers": "Because workers may have an elevated relative aerobic workload for several hours each working day, this relationship may elucidate a mechanism behind the increased risk for cardiovascular disease among workers exposed to high levels of occupational physical activity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found a positive relationship between aerobic workload and ambulatory blood pressure (ABP). Specifically, a 1% increase in mean relative aerobic workload was associated with an increase of 0.42 \u00b1 0.05 mmHg in systolic ABP and 0.30 \u00b1 0.04 mmHg in diastolic ABP."}
{"answers": "Our investigation did not undoubtedly prove that significant changes of fetal biometric parameters occurred in the last three decades. It is possible that secular growth acceleration does not exist in prenatal period but also the observed time period could have been short for this phenomenon to manifest.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no evidence of secular growth acceleration during fetal life, as the study found no statistically significant differences in fetal biometric parameters between the current population and those from 35 years ago."}
{"answers": "Consistent with prior studies, we found an inverse relationship between obesity and serum prostate specific antigen. However, the magnitude of the difference was small. Thus, adjusting prostate specific antigen for body mass index does not appear warranted.", "prediction_text": "No, the study suggests that there is no significant association between body mass index and prostate specific antigen in men without prostate cancer, and therefore, adjusting for body mass index is not necessary."}
{"answers": "Emergency laparotomy carries a high rate of mortality, especially in those over the age of 70 years, and more needs to be done to improve outcomes, particularly in this group. This could involve increasing acute surgical care manpower, early recognition of patients requiring emergency surgery, development of clear management protocols for such patients or perhaps even considering centralisation of emergency surgical services to specialist centres with multidisciplinary teams involving emergency surgeons and care of the elderly physicians in hospital and related community outreach services for post-discharge care.", "prediction_text": "Yes, 30-day and 1-year mortality in emergency general surgery laparotomies is an area of concern and need for improvement, with a 30-day mortality rate of 12.4% in patients aged <70 years and 22% in those aged >70 years, and a 1-year mortality rate of 25.15% in patients aged <70 years and 38% in those aged >70 years."}

{"answers": "Patients after ART treatment suffer from higher C-section rates during their stage of delivery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that patients who conceived through Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) have a higher risk of cesarean section (C-section) compared to those who conceived naturally. Specifically, the groups of fresh transferred embryos and slow freezing had higher risks of both elective and emergency C-sections."}
{"answers": "Trauma patients have a significant complication rate related to anticoagulation therapy, and predicting which patients will develop a complication remains unclear. Prospective studies are needed to determine which treatment regimen, if any, is appropriate to safely anticoagulate this high risk population.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients is not entirely safe, with a 21% incidence of complications, including bleeding and hemorrhage. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, those receiving unfractionated heparin (UH) rather than fractionated heparin (FH), and those with lower initial platelet counts are at higher risk of complications."}
{"answers": "A significant difference in dental health between recruits to each Service does exist and is a likely to be a reflection of the sociodemographic background from which they are drawn.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a differential in the dental health of new recruits to the British Armed Forces, with the Army having a significantly higher prevalence of dental decay and greater treatment resource need compared to the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force."}
{"answers": "In light of the large sample size and prior pilot testing of presented images, results suggest that episodic migraineurs do not differentially attend to headache-related facial stimuli. Given modest evidence of attentional biases among chronic headache samples, these findings suggest potential differences in attentional processing between chronic and episodic headache subforms.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no evidence to suggest that episodic migraineurs selectively attend to headache-related visual stimuli, as there were no between-group differences in attentional bias indices for headache or happy facial stimuli."}
{"answers": "Under the conditions of this study, preclerkship (year 2) CPEs strongly predicted medical students at risk for failing a senior CPE. This finding opens the opportunity for remediation of deficits prior to or during clerkships.", "prediction_text": "Yes, students' scores on preclerkship clinical performance examinations can predict that they will fail a senior clinical performance examination."}
{"answers": "Our results suggest that people do not attach a simple fixed premium to \"safety-related\" interventions but that preferences depend more subtly on context. The use of the results of such public preference surveys to directly inform policy would therefore be premature.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the public places more value on safety-related health care improvements when the health care system is not responsible for the harm, compared to when it is responsible."}
{"answers": "Minimising the radiation dose to one of the parotid glands with the help of IMRT in patients with advanced head and neck cancers can prevent xerostomia in most patients and parotid scintigraphy is a useful method of documenting xerostomia.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that dose reduction to one parotid gland may not prevent xerostomia in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancers undergoing intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with or without chemotherapy."}
{"answers": "It is important to continue FA supplementation over the long term in patients on methotrexate and FA in order to prevent them discontinuing treatment because of mouth ulcers or nausea and vomiting. Our data suggest that FA supplementation is also helpful in preventing neutropenia, with very little loss of efficacy of methotrexate.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that continuing folic acid supplementation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) established on methotrexate and folic acid may not be necessary, as there was no conclusive evidence of a decrease in methotrexate toxicity and a potential risk of decreased efficacy."}
{"answers": "LF and cruroplasty is feasible and has good results in terms of GERD symptoms control and additional weight loss. The high rate of postoperative complications observed in this series remains a matter of concern. A re-sleeve procedure might be considered as an alternative to RYGB/DS conversion restricted to selected patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, laparoscopic fundectomy (LF) is safe and effective as revision surgery for patients with residual fundus or neofundus after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms."}
{"answers": "VAT area measurement at a single level 3 cm above the lower margin of the L3 vertebra is feasible and can reflect changes in VAT volume and body weight. Advances in knowledge: As VAT area at a CT slice 3cm above the lower margin of L3 can best reflect interval changes in VAT volume and body weight, VAT area measurement should be selected at this location.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that measuring visceral adipose tissue area at a single level of 3 cm above the lower margin of L3 on a CT scan can represent changes in visceral adipose tissue volume with a strong correlation (r values of 0.853 and 0.902)."}
{"answers": "Barrett's cytokeratin 7/20 pattern can be a useful marker for the diagnosis of short-segment Barrett's oesophagus, although the false positive or false negative rate is approximately 25%.", "prediction_text": "Yes, cytokeratin immunoreactivity is useful in the diagnosis of short-segment Barrett's oesophagus in Korea, with a sensitivity and specificity of 77.8% and 77.5%, respectively."}
{"answers": "In this paper the effect of lunar phases on the time of delivery is shown. This influence seems to be especially relevant in the case of multiparae and plurigravidae. Nevertheless, it is too weak to allow for prediction regarding the days with the highest frequency of deliveries.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the lunar position appears to influence the time of delivery, with a higher likelihood of spontaneous full-term deliveries occurring around the full moon, particularly in multiparae and plurigravidae."}
{"answers": "Financial incentives for smoking cessation in pregnancy are highly cost-effective, with an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life years of \u00a3482, which is well below recommended decision thresholds.", "prediction_text": "Financial incentives for smoking cessation during pregnancy are not found to be cost-effective based on the study's findings. The incremental cost per quitter at 34-38 weeks pregnant was \u00a31127 ($1716), which is similar to the standard look-up value from Stapleton&West's published ICER tables. The life-time model resulted in an incremental cost of \u00a317 ($95% CI = -\u00a393, \u00a3107) and a gain of 0.04 QALYs (95% CI = -0.058, 0.145"}
{"answers": "This data demonstrates the robust nature of the short stay ward. At these two very different institutions we have shown improved bed efficient and patient care in a cost-effective way. We have also reported on greater parental satisfaction and early return of the child with their family to the community.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the short stay or 23-hour ward in a general and academic children's hospital is effective in increasing hospital efficiency and reducing costs, with an average length of stay of 17.5 hours and a low rate of admission to in-hospital beds and unscheduled visits within 72 hours of discharge."}
{"answers": "Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery is a safe method of treatment in patients with Cushing's disease. Operative findings, radiological and histological findings, together with early postoperative serum cortisol and urine free cortisol estimates may identify failures in treatment. Alternative treatment might then be required for these patients. Because of the risk of late relapse, patients require life-long follow-up.", "prediction_text": "Yes, certain factors can predict the outcome of transsphenoidal pituitary surgery in patients with Cushing's disease. The study found that the presence of a tumor at surgery significantly increased the likelihood of achieving remission (78.7% vs 21.3% for patients with and without a tumor, respectively). Additionally, when both radiological and histological findings were positive, the likelihood of achieving remission was higher than if both modalities were negative. Furthermore, early postoperative serum cortisol levels (2- and 6-week postoperative) and urine free cortisol levels (6-week postoperative) can also"}
{"answers": "Patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms have a great diversity of functional somatic symptoms. They use more somatic and psychotropic drugs than controls in the years before diagnosis. Moreover, they show high rates of referrals and psychiatric morbidity. The diversity of symptoms of patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms supports the concept that symptoms do not cluster in well defined distinct syndromes. Therefore, patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms should preferably not be classified into medical subspecialty syndromes.", "prediction_text": "No, the study suggests that chronic functional somatic symptoms are not a single syndrome, but rather a complex and multifaceted condition involving multiple body systems and a range of psychiatric and somatic comorbidities."}
{"answers": "The vast majority of MDT decisions are implemented. Management alteration was most often due to patient choice or additional information available after the MDT. A minority of management alterations were 'unjustifiable' and the authors recommend that any patient whose treatment is subsequently changed should have MDT rediscussion prior to treatment.", "prediction_text": "In this study, 91.5% of multidisciplinary team decisions for breast cancer management were found to be concordant with subsequent patient management, while 4.5% were discordant and 4% had no MDT decision. Of the discordant decisions, 17.8% were considered \"unjustifiable\" as there was no additional information available after the MDT to account for the change in management, while the remaining 82.2% were considered \"justifiable\" due to patient choice, additional information available after the MDT, or MDT error."}
{"answers": "We found that 1.6% of S. aureus (all MSSA) from bacteraemic patients were PVL-positive. This low incidence suggests that PVL-positive S. aureus are of no particular significance as causative agents of S. aureus bacteraemia.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL) is not associated with the pathogenesis of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia in the UK. Of the 244 S. aureus isolates from bacteraemic patients, only four (1.6%) were PVL-positive, and none of these isolates were oxacillin-resistant (methicillin-resistant S. aureus)."}
{"answers": "These findings are in accordance with previous experimental work and provide additional support for the assertion that dogs can prime autistic children for therapy. Ultimately, this study may contribute toward a change for full acceptance of canine-assisted therapy programs within the medical milieu. Additional studies using a similar research protocol on more autistic children will certainly help professionals to work on the most effective methods to individually serve this population through canine-assisted interventions.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that dogs can prime autistic children for therapy by increasing the frequency and duration of positive behaviors, and reducing the frequency and duration of negative behaviors."}
{"answers": "We conclude that increased cardiovascular risk of the DD genotype is not mediated through insulin resistance or abnormalities in fibrinolysis. Conversely, we report an increased sensitivity in NIDDM subjects with the ACE DD genotype.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the insertion allele (I) of the ACE gene I/D polymorphism is associated with insulin resistance in non-insulin-dependent diabetic (NIDDM) subjects."}
{"answers": "A history of PIPE may be a risk factor for the development of IPE. Yet, the disappearance of significance on multivariate analysis indicates that it is not an independent predictor.", "prediction_text": "Yes, postictal psychotic episodes (PIPE) are predictive of the development of interictal psychotic episodes (IPE) in patients with a partial seizure disorder. The study found that a history of PIPE, male gender, and the presence of bilateral ictal foci are predictive of the development of IPE in univariate logistic regression analyses, but these variables lost significance in a multivariate analysis."}
{"answers": "QTcD is significantly increased in hypertensive patients with LVH compared with those without, being strongly correlated with the indices of LVH. A QTcD cut-off value of 60 ms predicted LVH in hypertensive patients with a high sensitivity and specificity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, corrected QT dispersion (QTcD) can predict left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in hypertensive patients. The study found that QTcD was significantly higher in hypertensive patients with LVH compared to those without LVH, and that a cut-off value of 60 ms had the highest sensitivity and specificity for predicting LVH."}
{"answers": "The shaving of the incision site immediately before spinal surgery may increase the rate of postoperative infection.", "prediction_text": "Yes, shaving the incision site before spinal surgery increases the postsurgical infection rate."}
{"answers": "The majority of EMS professionals thought that they should participate in disease and injury prevention programs. The respondents were mixed as to whether prevention services should be provided while on emergency calls, but those with experience providing these services were more likely to agree with providing them during emergency calls.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, 82.7% of emergency medical services (EMS) professionals believe that EMS professionals should participate in disease prevention programs."}
{"answers": "Current K/DOQI guidelines are inadequate for correcting VDDI or secondary hyperparathyroidism in CKD patients. Future studies should examine the effects of higher or more frequent dosing of ergocalciferol on these clinical endpoints.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the current K/DOQI treatment guidelines for vitamin D deficiency in CKD patients may not be adequate, as only a minority of patients achieved vitamin D levels >30 ng/ml (75 nmol/l) after treatment with ergocalciferol."}
{"answers": "Baseline pain intensity does not predict the outcome after an appropriate opioid titration. It is likely that non-homogeneous pain treatment would have biased the outcome of a previous work.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no correlation between baseline pain intensity categories and opioid response in cancer patients."}
{"answers": "Maintaining viral load suppression over time in resource-limited-settings is feasible.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that it is feasible to maintain HIV viral load suppression over time in resource-limited settings, with 87.3% of patients having undetectable VL and only 16.5% experiencing virologic failure, despite the challenges of achieving and maintaining VL suppression in these settings."}
{"answers": "Mucosal redundancy is a constant associated finding in IHPS. Although the origin of the redundancy and a cause-and-effect relationship are difficult to establish, our findings support the hypothesis that hypergastrinemia may be implicated in the pathogenesis of IHPS, and suggest that mucosal thickening could be implicated as one of the initiating factors in its development.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is evidence to suggest that pyloric mucosal hypertrophy plays an etiologic role in the development of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS)."}
{"answers": "Given the available screening technologies, discordant TEOAE and AABR may be inevitable for some categories of hearing loss among apparently healthy newborns whose mothers received prenatal care. The potential limitations of perinatal morbidities as basis of targeted screening for such cases therefore merit further consideration.", "prediction_text": "Yes, discordance in TEOAE and AABR outcomes can be predicted in newborns based on various maternal and infant factors, including antenatal care status, mode of delivery, and nursery type."}
{"answers": "GM of CRC and SLM was associated with fewer procedures but did not influence overall survival. SM was associated with a longer delay and increased use of chemotherapy between procedures, suggesting that more rigorous selection of SM patients for surgery may explain the higher disease-free survival after SLM resection.", "prediction_text": "Global management of colorectal cancer with synchronous liver metastases (SLM) at the same centre may improve outcomes compared to separate management at different centers."}
{"answers": "epiDWI has the potential to differentiate pleomorphic adenoma and myoepithelial adenomas from all other examined entities. Due to an overlap not only within the group of benign and malignant lesions but also between groups, diagnoses should not be addressed on the basis of ADC values solely. Therefore, further studies combining DWI, morphologic criteria, and probably other MR imaging techniques seem warranted.", "prediction_text": "Yes, diffusion-weighted echo-planar MR imaging (epiDWI) can predict different histologic subtypes of primary parotid gland tumors with a high degree of accuracy, as demonstrated by the significant differences in apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) between various subtypes."}
{"answers": "The survey shows significant dissatisfaction amongst consultant radiologists with the current service, confirms a low number of paediatric radiologists taking on this work, and suggests the potential to increase numbers of radiology child abuse experts by 27% if given improved training and support. Appropriate service and education strategies should be implemented.", "prediction_text": "UK radiologists are not generally satisfied with the training and support received in suspected child abuse, with only 61% of departments having a dedicated paediatric radiologist and 73% of respondents indicating that they would not consider providing expert evidence in these cases."}
{"answers": "The enhancement of serum TNFalpha and IL-6 levels in the patients with ERCP-induced pancreatitis reflects the inflammatory activity. Additionally, these cytokines together with IL-4 can be used in clinical laboratory monitoring of ERCP.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the changes in the serum levels of IL-2, IL-4, TNFalpha, and IL-6 reflect the inflammatory activity in the patients with post-ERCP pancreatitis. Specifically, the lower levels of IL-4 at 24 hours after ERCP and the higher ratios of TNFalpha/IL-4 at 12 and 24 hours after ERCP in the complicated group suggest a more intense inflammatory response in these patients. Additionally, the increased levels of IL-6 at 24 hours after ERCP in the complicated group further support the idea that there is increased inflammation in these patients."}
{"answers": "During the 5 years, 24% of Africans with optimal BP developed hypertension. The surge in hypertension in Africa is largely explained by modifiable risk factors. Public health strategies should focus aggressively on lifestyle to prevent a catastrophic burden on the national health system.", "prediction_text": "Yes, behavioral risk factors such as smoking, waist circumference, and alcohol intake are significant predictors of the conversion from optimal blood pressure to hypertensive status in Black South Africans."}
{"answers": "Our data have revealed a number of differences. Compared to the clinic sample, the Web-based sample had worse psychological symptom burden, younger average age, higher prevalence of employment, and a lower proportion on ART. For future research, we recommend that Web-based data collection should include the demographic variables that we note differed between samples. In addition, we recognize that each recruitment method may bring inherent sampling bias, with clinic populations differing by geographical location and reflecting those accessing regular medical care, and Web-based sampling recruiting those with greater Internet access and identifying survey materials through specific searches and contact with specific websites.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that Web-based and clinic samples of gay men living with HIV differed on self-reported physical and psychological symptoms. Specifically, the Web-based sample reported higher levels of psychological symptoms and lower levels of physical symptoms compared to the clinic sample. Additionally, the study found that employment status was associated with both physical and psychological symptoms, with those in employment reporting lower levels of symptoms compared to those not in employment."}
{"answers": "The majority of acetabular components in this cohort were stable despite the small contact surface achieved between the component and pelvic bone. Three of 10 migrated in excess of the limits that predict later loosening in primary THA but it remains to be seen whether these limits apply to this selected group of frail osteoporotic patients. We continue to use this technique routinely to treat patients with the same indications, but since the analysis of these data we have added screw fixation of the acetabular component to the ischial tuberosity and the superior pubic ramus.", "prediction_text": "The study found that cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups does not provide initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures. At 1 year postoperatively, three of the 10 components had migration above the suggested limits for primary THA, indicating a lack of initial stability. Additionally, the contact surface achieved between the acetabular component and pelvis was found to be variable, with a range of 11 to 17 cm(2) (15%-27% of each component)."}
{"answers": "Despite high perioperative mortality, results document a sustainable recovery of the survivors offering the prospect of a highly independent and satisfying life. Therefore, advanced age alone should not be a contraindication for redo cardiac interventions. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2016; 16: 1138-1144.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that cardiac reoperations in octogenarians do not provide significant benefits in terms of survival or quality of life. Despite the high in-hospital mortality rate (32.1%) and the significant number of patients who died during follow-up (19.0%), the survivors had similar functional status and quality of life as an age- and sex-matched normative population."}
{"answers": "Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (ie, SMI) were more likely than other patients to be admitted to nursing homes with higher deficiency citations for both overall quality and clinical care quality. Further research is necessary to understand the reasons behind the disparity in quality of nursing home care associated with SMI.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patients with serious mental illness (SMI) are more likely to be admitted to nursing homes with more deficiencies in care compared to other patients. Specifically, patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder tend to enter nursing homes with higher levels of total and healthcare-related deficiencies."}
{"answers": "Patients undergoing open access procedures are less likely to be properly informed about their endoscopic procedure. Our results indicate that with open access endoscopy, a defined mechanism needs to be in place for communication of endoscopic results to the patient.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that open access endoscopy may lead to inadequate informed consent and procedure acceptance, as patients in the open access group reported receiving less information and explanation concerning the nature of the procedure compared to the group referred from a gastrointestinal (GI) subspecialty clinic."}
{"answers": "Contrary to common belief, we found that uterine myomas commonly decrease in volume over the course of pregnancy.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, the majority of uterine myomas (55.1%) actually decreased in size during pregnancy, while 44.9% enlarged."}
{"answers": "We found that all of the studied dimensions of restricted fetal growth are independently associated with increased risks of low intellectual performance and that these associations are only partly mediated by socioeconomic or familial factors.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the association between birth characteristics and low intellectual performance in early adulthood is not significantly confounded by socioeconomic factors in adolescence or familial effects."}
{"answers": "Although feasible, double reading of barium enemas does not improve sensitivity for detection of polyps and produces a higher false-positive rate.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that double reading of barium enemas is not necessary, as it does not significantly improve the detection of lesions or alter clinical treatment. The addition of a second reader resulted in a small increase in the number of positive results, but the specificity decreased. The study concludes that a single reader can accurately detect lesions with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity."}
{"answers": "The VMPA can provide direct access and favorable visibility to the TMJ region and yield good esthetic and functional results. The VMPA can be considered the approach of choice for common TMJ surgeries.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the vascular-guided multilayer preauricular approach (VMPA) to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) can improve access and reduce complications compared to traditional surgical approaches."}
{"answers": "The metastasis rate of station 9 lymph nodes was significantly lower than other mediastinal stations in lung cancer patients. The metastasis status of station 9 had no significant influence on tumor staging or prognosis. Routine dissection of station 9 lymph nodes may not be necessary, especially in patients with a low T stage, upper or middle lobe tumors, or without intrapulmonary lymph node metastasis.", "prediction_text": "Based on the study findings, routine dissection of station 9 lymph nodes during lung cancer surgery is not necessary for primary lung cancer. The metastasis rate of station 9 was found to be significantly lower than other mediastinal stations, and the absence of station 9 dissection did not significantly impair the staging results or prognosis of most patients."}
{"answers": "During the time period considered, the FDA AED-related suicidality warning does not appear to have significantly affected prescription claims of AED medications for the study population.", "prediction_text": "No significant change in trend was detected in antiepileptic drug (AED) prescription claims among members with epilepsy and/or psychiatric disorder following the FDA suicidality warning."}
{"answers": "In our population of stroke survivors, self-reports of motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions differed from government records. In future studies, the use of both government and self-reported data would ensure a more accurate picture of driving safety post-stroke.", "prediction_text": "There is a moderate agreement between government records (Department of Transportation) and self-reported data on motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions for stroke survivors, with a kappa coefficient of 0.52 for collisions and 0.47 for convictions. However, when both sources of data are consulted, up to 56% more accidents and up to 46% more convictions are identified in the study population in the 5 years before study entry compared to when either source is used alone."}
{"answers": "The realized communication skills courses resulted in relevant changes in communication behaviour and self-confidence of participants. Communication with terminally ill patients can be taught.", "prediction_text": "Yes, communication with terminally ill patients can be taught through a structured course model, as demonstrated in the study. The course was found to improve participants' communication skills, including their sense of security in different communication settings and their ability to communicate a diagnosis of cancer with good or less good prognosis, recurrence of cancer, or a far progressive cancer disease without curative approach."}
{"answers": "For conditions with a well-developed quality of care evidence base, such as hypertension and diabetes, a single structured implicit review to assess the quality of care over a period of time is moderately reliable. This method could be a reasonable complement or alternative to explicit indicator approaches for assessing and comparing quality of care. Structured implicit review, like explicit quality measures, must be used more cautiously for illnesses for which the evidence base is less well developed, such as COPD and acute, short-course illnesses.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a role for peer review in profiling quality of care, particularly for conditions with a well-established evidence base, such as diabetes and hypertension. The study found that the reliability of implicit review for these conditions was significantly higher compared to less developed evidence base conditions, such as COPD and a collection of acute conditions."}
{"answers": "The high rate of unsuccessful IUD insertions reported here, particularly for nulliparous women, suggests that the true insertion failure rate of providers who are not employing additional tools for difficult insertions may be much higher than reported in clinical trials. Further investigation is necessary to determine if this is a common problem and, if so, to assess if the use of adjuvant measures will reduce the number of unsuccessful IUD insertions.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that failed IUD insertions are an under-recognized problem in community practice, particularly among nulliparous women."}
{"answers": "Even in capped health care systems, virtual planning and guided surgery including prebent or milled plates are financially viable.", "prediction_text": "Yes, virtual planning and guided surgery for head and neck reconstruction are economically viable, as the time saved during surgery can offset the additional cost of planning and cutting-guide production."}
{"answers": "Bipolarity does not independently influence risk of suicidal behavior or alter the influence of well-established suicide risk factors within affective disorders. Suicide risk assessment strategies may continue to appraise these common risk factors without regard to mood polarity.", "prediction_text": "No, the risk factors for suicidal behavior do not differ by affective disorder polarity."}
{"answers": "The administration of polyvalent Crotalidae antivenin is safe. Acute hypersensitivity, when it occurs, consists solely in most cases of urticaria. Serious side effects are uncommon.", "prediction_text": "No, the aggressive use of polyvalent antivenin for rattlesnake bites does not result in serious acute side effects, according to the study. The incidence of acute side effects, such as urticaria, was found to be low (18%), and there were no deaths, amputations, or permanent disability reported among the patients who received antivenin."}
{"answers": "Although endomyocardial fibrosis patients have improved clinical symptoms after surgery, the global left ventricular ejection fraction and regional wall motion in these patients do not change. This finding suggests that other explanations, such as improvements in diastolic function, may be operational.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no change in quantitative left ventricular regional wall motion after fibrous tissue resection in endomyocardial fibrosis."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrates that laser pretreatment significantly increases absorption of topical lidocaine so that it is detectable in the blood and that manipulating laser settings can affect drug absorption. Future work will look at translating this effect into clinical benefit.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that fractional lasers can enhance transdermal absorption of topical lidocaine in an in vivo animal model. The peak levels of lidocaine were significantly higher at 250 \u00b5m ablative depth, compared to other laser settings, and the peak levels of its metabolite monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) were significantly higher at the same depth."}
{"answers": "Vaccines were exposed to temperatures that may reduce their potency. Safe storage of vaccines in the clinics cannot be ensured without adhering to the recommended guidelines. Provision of adequate equipment and training for staff in maintaining the \"cold chain\" and the use and care of equipment are important components of a successful immunisation programme.", "prediction_text": "The study found that there is a weak link in the cold chain for the storage of vaccines in the community, with many general practices and child health clinics not adhering to the recommended storage conditions for vaccines as outlined by the Department of Health."}
{"answers": "p53 alteration detected by IHC or SSCP analysis is not a clinically useful predictor of local response to pre-operative adjuvant therapy in advanced rectal carcinoma.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that p53 alterations cannot be used to predict tumour response to pre-operative chemo-radiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer."}
{"answers": "The results of this study cast doubt on the suggested advantage of HBO in reducing patient mortality and morbidity when used as adjuvant therapy for NF.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) therapy may be beneficial in the treatment of necrotizing fasciitis (NF), with a lower mortality rate and more surgical d\u00e9bridements required in the HBO-treated group compared to the non-HBO group. However, the study did not find a significant difference in the length of hospitalization between the two groups. Therefore, HBO can be considered an indication for the treatment of NF, but further studies are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "High doses of ZNS are effective and safe in pharmacoresistant epileptic patients. Therapeutic drug monitoring of ZNS may be considered at therapeutic failure.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that high doses of zonisamide (>500 mg/d) may be effective and well-tolerated in adult patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy, with a response rate of 55% and good tolerance in 66% of patients. However, the study has limitations due to its small sample size and lack of available plasma levels for all patients. Therefore, further studies with larger sample sizes and more comprehensive data are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "In conclusion, high Ki-67 expression was associated with poor survival in patients with UTUC, as well as a high risk of disease progression, although these findings need to be interpreted with caution. Large-scale, adequately designed, prospective trials are needed to further confirm the value of Ki-67 in prognosis of UTUC patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, overexpression of Ki-67 is a prognostic biomarker of upper tract urinary carcinoma (UTUC). The study found that high Ki-67 expression was associated with poorer cancer-specific survival and disease-free survival in UTUC patients, and this association was confirmed in a meta-analysis of the published literature."}
{"answers": "After comparing MR with arthroscopic findings and reviewing the available literature, we conclude that arthroscopy permits the direct visualization of even fine articular surface changes but does not depict the subchondral bone, the most frequent site of injury detected with MRI. MRI was a very useful tool in the detection and characterization of the different types of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries and showed a statistically significant correlation between site and distribution of bone and cartilage injuries and between internal damage and trauma mechanisms. Therefore, we believe that MRI can help avoid diagnostic arthroscopy in the patients with a history of post-traumatic pain, acute articular blocks and negative radiographic findings.", "prediction_text": "No, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) cannot substitute for diagnostic arthroscopy in the detection and characterization of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries in the knee."}
{"answers": "The prevalence of cognitive impairment in MND in this population based study of an unselected cohort was higher than has been previously reported. Language deficits, especially anomia, may be relatively frequent in the MND population. Aphasia in MND may be masked by dysarthria and missed if not specifically examined.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that dementia and aphasia are underrecognized associations in motor neuron disease."}
{"answers": "Postoperative numbness occurs in most patients receiving nasal microfat injections. Partial to complete recovery of nasal tip sensation can be expected to occur over a 3-month period.", "prediction_text": "Yes, sensation gradually returns to the nasal tip after microfat grafting, with a significant recovery observed at 12 weeks post-procedure."}
{"answers": "Conveyance of emotions or movements through music may be decoded differently by persons with different types of communication disorders. Because music is the primary therapeutic tool in music therapy sessions, clinicians should consider these differential abilities when selecting music for clinical interventions focusing on emotions or movement.", "prediction_text": "Yes, communication disorders can extend to musical messages, as the study found that children with severe to profound hearing loss (using cochlear implants) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) had difficulty recognizing emotions or movements in music, compared to children with typical development and normal hearing."}
{"answers": "For some patients, using colour to describe their pain experience may be a useful tool to improve doctor-patient communication.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) generally found the idea of using color to describe their pain to be acceptable, but not all participants found it to be a suitable way to describe their pain. The most common colors associated with high-intensity pain were red, as it symbolized inflammation, fire, anger, and the stop signal in a traffic light system. On the other hand, colors associated with the absence of pain were chosen because of their positive emotional connotations, such as purity, calmness, and happiness. Participants also identified a range of colors to represent changes in pain intensity, with aching pain associated with gray or black, and sharp"}
{"answers": "It appears safe to administer intensive chemotherapy regimens at standard doses to rural patients without increased morbidity or mortality. Support for general practitioners through phone or videoconferencing may reduce the safety concerns.", "prediction_text": "The study found that intensive chemotherapy is safe for rural cancer patients, with no significant differences in serious adverse events or dose intensities between urban and rural patients at the Townsville Cancer Centre."}
{"answers": "Although outcomes for EPSCC remains poor, both surgery and radiation is shown to significantly improve median, 5- and 10-year survival rates. EPSCC patients who are potential candidates for surgical resection or radiation therapy may benefit from these treatments.", "prediction_text": "Yes, surgery and radiation therapy have a significant impact on survival for patients with extrapulmonary small cell cancers, with improved median, 5-year, and 10-year survival rates for patients who undergo these treatments, particularly for gastrointestinal disease."}
{"answers": "DGE after PPPD seems to be of minor clinical importance following uncomplicated surgery. When taking the results into consideration, it can be said that, despite the lack of a control group, antecolic duodenojejunostomy might be the key to a low incidence of DGE after PPPD. In our experience, DGE is linked to the occurrence of other postoperative complications rather than to pylorus preservation.", "prediction_text": "No, the incidence of delayed gastric emptying (DGE) after pancreaticoduodenectomy is not directly related to the preservation of the pylorus."}
{"answers": "In women with POP, the symptom of pelvic pain is associated with the presence of defecatory symptoms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, pelvic pain is associated with defecatory symptoms in women with pelvic organ prolapse (POP). The study found that women with pelvic pain are more likely to experience straining with bowel movement, sense of incomplete emptying, pain with bowel movement, and splinting with bowel movement compared to those without pelvic pain."}
{"answers": "The results confirm that c-kit is vastly expressed in uveal melanoma, suggest that the c-kit molecular pathway may be important in uveal melanoma growth, and point to its use as a target for therapy with STI571.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that c-Kit-dependent growth of uveal melanoma cells is a potential therapeutic target. The study found that c-Kit is strongly expressed and tyrosine phosphorylated in cultured uveal melanoma cells, and that treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 resulted in cell death. The IC(50) of the inhibitory effects on c-Kit phosphorylation and cell proliferation was found to be less than 2.5 microM, indicating a relatively high potency of STI571 in inhibiting c-Kit-dependent growth of uveal melan"}
{"answers": "Results suggest that telmisartan may reduce type-I diabetes mellitus-induced hepatic injury by suppressing activated hepatic stellate cells through concomitant TGF-beta1 down-regulation.", "prediction_text": "Telmisartan does not prevent hepatic fibrosis in rats with alloxan-induced diabetes."}
{"answers": "The great majority of U.S. renal transplant centers will not transplant kidneys to HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease, even if their infection is asymptomatic. However, advances in the management of HIV infection and a review of relevant ethical issues suggest that this approach should be reconsidered.", "prediction_text": "According to the survey, the majority of U.S. transplant centers (84%) would not transplant a kidney into an asymptomatic HIV-infected patient who refuses HIV testing, and only a few centers (4%) would consider transplanting an HIV-infected patient. Therefore, it can be concluded that the current policy among U.S. transplant centers is to generally exclude HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease from transplantation."}
{"answers": "The overall yield of SL for HCC was 7 %, and the accuracy was 27 %. When accurate imaging methods are available and additional percutaneous liver biopsy is implemented as a standard procedure in the preoperative workup of patients with HCC, the benefit of SL will become even less.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that staging laparoscopy (SL) is not very useful in detecting unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients, with a yield of only 7% and an accuracy of 27%."}
{"answers": "Expert breast pathology assessments continue to be necessary in the management of DCIS.", "prediction_text": "Yes, expert breast pathology assessment is necessary for the management of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The study found that secondary pathology assessments led to a change in the assessment of local recurrence risk in 29% and contributed to a change in treatment recommendation in 43% of cases."}
{"answers": "Vaginal pH should be measured by bringing the pH strip in direct contact with fresh vaginal fluid without first adding saline.", "prediction_text": "No, the study suggests that pH measurement from wet mount microscopy slides is not accurate and can lead to false positive readings due to the addition of saline, regardless of the sampling device used or the diagnosis of the vaginal infection."}
{"answers": "This study presents a different clinical picture of oral mucoceles/ranulas, as observed in HIV-positive patients. Additionally, it suggests a possible clinical link between the two pathologies. The authors strongly support the suggestion that oral mucocele/ranula is an HIV-related salivary gland disease.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that oral mucocele/ranula is another HIV-related salivary gland disease, with a higher incidence among HIV-positive patients compared to HIV-negative patients."}
{"answers": "There are no data to support the widespread practice of using central venous pressure to guide fluid therapy. This approach to fluid resuscitation should be abandoned.", "prediction_text": "The meta-analysis found that central venous pressure does not accurately predict fluid responsiveness in adult patients, with a summary area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.56 (95% CI, 0.54-0.58). The correlation coefficient between baseline central venous pressure and change in stroke volume index/cardiac index was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.1-0.25), with higher coefficients found in intensive care unit (ICU) patients compared to operating room patients."}
{"answers": "Increased D-dimer levels should not be considered as a diagnostic parameter in diagnosis of acute appendicitis.", "prediction_text": "No, the study does not suggest that D-dimer can become a new diagnostic parameter for acute appendicitis. The results showed no statistically significant difference in D-dimer levels between histopathologic study groups, and the ratio of cases with a number of leukocytes below the upper limit was also not significantly different."}
{"answers": "Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mitochondria play a role in remodeling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death (PCD). The study found that mitochondrial dynamics, including distribution, motility, and membrane potential, change during PCD in the lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis). The mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) formation is also involved in PCD, as inhibition of PTP by cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment resulted in fewer perforations in the leaves."}
{"answers": "Our study emphasised the discomfort of transurethral urinary catheters, especially in male patients, and the high incidence of urinary tract infections in both sexes. Consideration should be given to the utilisation of alternative methods of bladder drainage, such as suprapubic catheterisation, which can be performed with ease during laparotomy.", "prediction_text": "No, transurethral catheterization is not the ideal method of bladder drainage based on the study's findings. Male patients were more dissatisfied with the procedure and experienced more pain during catheterization and removal, and half of the patients developed symptoms of urinary tract infection after catheter removal."}
{"answers": "Based on this pilot data, MASCC score appears promising in determining suitability for outpatient management of NF in gynecologic oncology patients. Prospective study is ongoing to confirm safety and determine impact on cost.", "prediction_text": "Risk stratification using the MASCC index is useful for predicting severe complications and mortality in gynecologic oncology patients with neutropenic fever, with a positive predictive value of 50% and negative predictive value of 90%. Inpatient management may be more appropriate for high-risk patients, while outpatient management may be feasible for low-risk patients."}
{"answers": "Halofantrine has mild to moderate pathological effects on cochlea histology, and can be considered an ototoxic drug.", "prediction_text": "Yes, halofantrine is ototoxic. The study found that the drug caused loss and distortion of inner hair cells, inner phalangeal cells, and spiral ganglia cells in guinea pigs."}
{"answers": "Proportionally fewer elderly patients with OPSCC are being treated than younger individuals. These patients can have significant benefits from aggressive treatments despite their older age as shown by our survival analysis. We recommend the use of objective measures to assess patient fitness to reduce the potential for undertreatment in the elderly population.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that elderly patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) are undertreated, particularly those aged 65-74 and 75-84 years old. The analysis showed that these age groups had substantial benefits in disease-specific survival (DSS) with surgery, radiation, or combined therapy compared to younger age groups. However, multivariate analysis did not demonstrate any statistically significant difference in the hazard ratios for combined treatment among the age groups."}
{"answers": "Minimal access surgery for the repair of esophageal atresia or congenital diaphragmatic hernia is not associated with less cumulative opioid doses.", "prediction_text": "No, minimal access major surgery in newborns does not hurt less than conventional surgery. The study found that the cumulative opioid doses at 12, 24, 48 hours and 7 days postoperatively were not significantly different between the minimal access surgery group and the control group for both congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) and esophageal atresia (EA) patients."}
{"answers": "Clinical predictors appear inadequate for the evaluation of the cervical spine in geriatric trauma patients with low-energy mechanism.", "prediction_text": "No, clinical predictors are not adequate in identifying cervical spine fractures in geriatric blunt trauma patients with low-energy mechanism."}
{"answers": "European individuals with type 1 diabetes consume a high atherogenic diet as few patients met recommendations for dietary fibre and saturated fat. This study showed minor changes in dietary nutrients and energy intakes over a period of 7 years. Nutrition education needs particular focus on strategies to increase dietary fibre and reduce saturated fat to exploit their potential benefit.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that individuals with type 1 diabetes in Europe do not consume a high atherogenic diet. In fact, there were minor changes in nutrient intakes over time, with some reductions in saturated fat and cholesterol intakes, and some increases in carbohydrate and fibre intakes. While there were some variations in adherence to European nutritional recommendations, the overall dietary pattern was not found to be atherogenic."}
{"answers": "The gaps in patella eversion demonstrated smaller gaps both in knee extension and flexion position compared to the gaps of patella reduction position. The amount of decreased gaps was more definite in knee flexion position. Therefore, the intraoperative patellar positioning has influence on the measurement of the joint gap. Keeping the patella in reduced position is important during gap balancing.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patella position significantly influences ligament balancing in total knee arthroplasty, with patella eversion resulting in smaller gaps in both knee extension and flexion positions compared to patella reduction."}
{"answers": "We have thus provided compelling evidence that there is a mossy fiber GABAergic signal. The physiologic role of this mossy fiber GABAergic signal is uncertain, but may be of developmental importance. Other evidence suggests that this GABAergic signal is transiently upregulated after seizures. This could have an inhibitory or disinhibitory effect, and further work is needed to elucidate its actual role.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mossy fibers release GABA. The study found that mossy fiber terminals show intense immunoreactivity for GABA and GAD67, and electrical stimuli that recruit dentate granule cells elicit monosynaptic GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic signals in CA3 pyramidal neurons."}
{"answers": "Men and women in this community sample reported similar patterns of depressive symptoms. No evidence that the presentation of depressive symptoms differs by gender was found.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that there were no significant gender differences in the self-report of depression symptoms after adjusting for potential influential characteristics."}
{"answers": "Time to primary treatment after a diagnosis of breast cancer had no impact on overall survival. Further studies on care before diagnosis are important in drawing up meaningful quality indicators.", "prediction_text": "No, delays in time to primary treatment after a diagnosis of breast cancer do not impact survival, according to the study."}
{"answers": "Our findings reveal a significant decrease in ADMA levels of ex-ELBW subjects compared to C, underlining a probable correlation with preterm birth and low birth weight. Taken together, these results may underlie the onset of early circulatory dysfunction predictive of increased cardiovascular risk.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that low levels of ADMA in young adults born preterm may predict early endothelial dysfunction."}
{"answers": "ECL assays improved the ability to predict time to diabetes in these autoantibody-positive relatives at risk for developing diabetes. These findings might be helpful in the design and eligibility criteria for prevention trials in the future.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assays can improve the prediction of time to type 1 diabetes in autoantibody-positive TrialNet subjects. The study found that subjects who were positive for ECL-GADA and/or ECL-IAA had a significantly higher risk of developing diabetes compared to those who were negative for these autoantibodies. Additionally, adding ECL to the Diabetes Prevention Trial risk score (DPTRS) improved the accuracy of predicting time to diabetes."}
{"answers": "These findings indicate that a relationship between multiple sclerosis and streptococcal infections may exist, but to acquire a better understanding of the role of group A streptococci in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, more studies with animal models are necessary.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant relationship between streptococcal infection and multiple sclerosis, as ADNase B levels were found to be higher in patients with MS compared to healthy controls."}
{"answers": "Aplastic anemia is associated with a variety of autoimmune syndromes. The sequence of events in our patient suggests that the hepatic failure, AFOP, and the VSAA may all have been part of an autoimmune syndrome. AFOP could be the result of immune dysregulation in this pediatric case with favorable outcome after immunosuppressive therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the authors of the study suggest that acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP) in children may be an expression of immune dysregulation, as all reported cases in children have been fatal and the patient in this study responded to immunosuppressive therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation."}
{"answers": "Rescue AC may apply to only 18% of cases, and we identified subsets of more likely candidates.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the duration of continuation of pregnancy after antenatal corticosteroid (AC) administration is limited, with only a small percentage of women delivering at 34 weeks or later after receiving AC. The study does not support the idea of using ultrasound as a conclusive diagnostic tool for internal derangements of the temporomandibular joint."}
{"answers": "The results show that fatigue in patients with pSS and sSS is not due to the coexistence of FM in most cases. A lower incidence in the United Kingdom of FM in patients with pSS was found than has been previously reported.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant link between fatigue and fibromyalgia (FM) in patients with primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (pSS). The study found that 68% of patients with pSS reported fatigue, which is a significantly higher prevalence than in the lupus group (50%). Additionally, none of the patients with pSS and secondary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (sSS) had FM, while 12% of patients with pSS and 5% of patients with lupus had FM. These findings suggest that there is a strong association between fatigue and FM in patients with pSS."}
{"answers": "UDR provides an objective measurement of VUR and appears as a predictive tool of success after endoscopic injection.", "prediction_text": "Yes, according to the study, distal ureteral diameter (UD) can predict reflux resolution after endoscopic injection in children with primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). The study found that UD and UD ratio (UDR) were significant predictors of reflux resolution on logistic regression analysis."}
{"answers": ": Data from both association and expression studies suggested that variants at HINT1 may be associated with schizophrenia and the associations may be sex-specific. However, the markers showing associations were in high LD to the SPEC2/PDZ-GEF2/ACSL6 locus reported previously in the same samples. This made it difficult to separate the association signals amongst these genes. Other independent studies may be necessary to distinguish these candidate genes.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the HINT1 gene may be a candidate for schizophrenia, as the authors found nominally significant differences in allele frequencies in several SNPs in both the ISHDSF and ICCSS samples, with a sex-stratified effect that differed between the two samples. However, the expression level of HINT1 was not significantly different between postmortem brain cDNAs from schizophrenic patients and unaffected controls."}
{"answers": "Out of the four sacral sparing criteria, the acute phase anal sensory score measurements do not contribute significantly to the prognosis of independent ambulation. The combination of the acute phase voluntary anal contraction and the S4-5 LT and PP scores, predicts significantly better chronic phase-independent ambulation outcomes than the currently used distinction between complete and incomplete SCI.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the combination of voluntary anal contraction and sensory scores at the S4-5 level (light touch and pin prick) may be a better predictor of independent ambulation at 1 year post-injury than the current distinction between complete and incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI). The study found that the use of this combination of criteria had a significantly higher area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) than the current distinction between complete and incomplete SCI, indicating better discriminating ability in predicting independent ambulation."}
{"answers": "These findings suggest that schizophrenia is associated with progressive structural brain abnormalities, affecting both gray and white matter. We found no evidence to suggest progressive medial temporal lobe involvement but did find evidence that this may be partly explained by heterogeneity between studies in patient age and illness duration. The causes and clinical correlates of these progressive brain changes should now be the focus of investigation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that there are progressive brain changes in schizophrenia, with significant decreases in volume over time in various brain regions, including the whole brain, frontal gray and white matter, parietal white matter, and temporal white matter, as well as increases in lateral ventricular volume."}
{"answers": "The elevated risk of death after CABG surgery known previously to be associated with CDM seems also to be shared by a group of similar size that includes patients with IFG and undiagnosed DM.", "prediction_text": "Yes, even impaired fasting blood glucose levels (IFG) below the diagnostic threshold for diabetes mellitus (DM) are associated with increased mortality after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. The study found that patients with IFG had a higher risk of 30-day and 1-year mortality compared to those with normal fasting blood glucose levels."}
{"answers": "This is the first known report of concurrent plasma and ISF concentrations of a meropenem antibiotic during CVVHDF. We observed that the ISF concentrations of meropenem were significantly lower than the plasma concentrations, although the present dose was appropriate for infections caused by intermediately susceptible pathogens (MIC\u22644 mg/L).", "prediction_text": "Yes, interstitial fluid (ISF) concentrations of meropenem in critically ill patients receiving continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) are equivalent to plasma concentrations."}
{"answers": "Despite advances in early diagnosis and surgical technique, 5-year survival of stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma remains low as compared to survival of other solid organ neoplasm. Tumour size<or=3cm, adenocarcinoma histologic type and negative bronchial resection margins were associated with a more favourable outcome in our patient population. More effective multimodality treatments are needed to increase survival rates.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that Stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma may not be as early a stage as previously thought, as the prognostic factors identified in the study include tumor size and histology, which are more commonly associated with more advanced stages of lung cancer."}
{"answers": "There is a knowledge deficit regarding the SU treatment goal among gout patients receiving ULT, despite generally high levels of other gout-specific knowledge. SU goal information may be an important and underutilized concept among providers treating gout patients.", "prediction_text": "Only 14% of gout patients in the study knew their target serum urate (SU) goal, while the majority answered correctly for the other 5 gout-specific knowledge questions."}
{"answers": "Despite government assistance, low-income individuals use vision care services less often than wealthy individuals.", "prediction_text": "Yes, government-funded low-income vision care programs improve utilization of eye care services among low-income individuals in Canada, particularly among those with financial difficulty."}
{"answers": "Premature births from rural mothers have a higher risk of stillbirth and mortality in neonatal intensive care than urban infants.", "prediction_text": "Yes, rural residence is associated with poorer outcomes in premature infants, including higher mortality rates and a higher stillbirth rate."}
{"answers": "Altered ET-1 levels may be involved in the pathogenesis of rebound hypertension and hypotension during HD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that endothelin-1 (ET-1) plays a role in the hemodynamic changes during hemodialysis (HD). Intradialytic changes in ET-1 levels were found to be associated with the hemodynamic status of patients during HD, with higher levels of ET-1 observed in patients who experienced dialysis-induced hypotension and rebound hypertension."}
{"answers": "While FS was commonly used in patients undergoing thyroidectomy at our institution, in no patient over the last decade did FS correctly alter the intraoperative management. Given the time required to perform FS and the cost associated with it, we believe that routine FS should not be performed in these patients.", "prediction_text": "No, the frozen section (FS) did not alter the intraoperative management of multinodular thyroid disease in the study population."}
{"answers": "Elderly patients have informational and relational needs similar to those of younger patients. In fact, most of the whole sample flagged up the need for higher levels of satisfaction especially concerning a better dialogue with health staff, along with a new factor: the need to talk to people with the same illness.", "prediction_text": "Yes, elderly cancer patients have different care needs compared with younger patients, particularly in the areas of financial-insurance information, support, and communication with healthcare providers."}
{"answers": "According to the results of our study and the data from the international literature, the entity globulomaxillary cyst is no longer justified.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the entity of \"globulomaxillary cysts\" is no longer valid, as it has been found to be a collection of different pathological processes in the region. Instead, the cystic lesions in this area can be classified into several distinct entities, including lateral periodontal cysts, radicular cysts, keratocystic odontogenic tumors, adenomatoid odontogenic tumors, periapical granulomas, residual cysts, and undefined jaw cysts."}
{"answers": "Although components of the CSM (cognitive and emotional representations, coping strategies) were associated with fears of recurrence, optimism was found to be the strongest predictor of fear, independent of anxiety and level of fear reported prior to treatment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, according to the study, pre-treatment fears and optimism can predict long-term fears of recurrence in head and neck cancer survivors."}
{"answers": "Older adults enrolled in PICT with more symptoms may sacrifice QOL for experimental treatment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, symptoms do matter when considering patients for phase I clinical trials in older adults with advanced cancer. Older adults with more symptoms (>3) have a higher likelihood of admissions, complications, and greater decline in functional status compared to those with fewer symptoms (\u22643)."}
{"answers": "Effective CPAP treatment in IPF patients with OSA results in a significant improvement in daily living activities based on the FOSQ, namely an OSA-specific follow-up instrument. Improvement was also noted in other questionnaires assessing quality of life, though not to a statistically significant degree, probably because of the multifactorial influences of IPF on physical and mental health. The probability of poor CPAP compliance was high and could only be eliminated with intense follow-up by the CPAP clinic staff.", "prediction_text": "Yes, CPAP therapy offers a significant improvement in quality of life and sleep parameters in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)."}
{"answers": "Income support policy may be a significant new lever for improving population health, especially that of lower-income persons. Even though the findings are robust, further analyses are needed to confirm their reliability. Future research should examine a variety of different income support policies, as well as whether a broader range of social and economic policies affect health.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program is found to reduce disability among the elderly. An increase of $100 per month in the maximum SSI benefit was linked to a 0.46 percentage point decrease in mobility limitations among single elderly individuals."}
{"answers": "None of the clinical identifiers for early-stage adhesive capsulitis previously proposed by expert consensus have been validated in this study. Clinicians should be aware that commonly used clinical identifiers may not be applicable to this stage.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that among the 8 clinical identifiers proposed for early-stage primary/idiopathic adhesive capsulitis, only pain at the end of range of all measured active movements was associated with a positive anesthetic response (PAR)."}
{"answers": "Despite current recommendations, cough and cold medicines are still used in children younger than 6 years of age. A significant portion of caregivers report that they are still unaware of public warnings, potential side effects, and interactions with other medications.", "prediction_text": "Despite FDA warnings, concerns about the use of cold preparations in young children persist, with 82% of caregivers stating they would still use these medications and 72% incorrectly dosing them."}
{"answers": "Vitamin C reduces the prevalence of complex regional pain syndrome after wrist fractures. A daily dose of 500 mg for fifty days is recommended.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that vitamin C can prevent complex regional pain syndrome in patients with wrist fractures, with the highest effectiveness observed in the 1500 mg/day dose group."}
{"answers": "The tendency to clear one's plate when eating is associated with increased body weight and may constitute a risk factor for weight gain.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that a tendency to clear one's plate when eating is associated with a higher body weight and is a risk factor for obesity."}
{"answers": "ACS is common in patients with SCD who present with fever and was grossly underestimated by evaluating physicians. History and physical examination appear to be of little value in defining which febrile patients require CXR. In view of the mortality and morbidity associated with ACS, empiric CXR should be considered when evaluating a febrile patient with SCD.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that clinician assessment for acute chest syndrome (ACS) in febrile patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) is not accurate enough, as only 39% of physicians were able to correctly identify ACS based on physical examination and clinical impression."}
{"answers": "We conclude that the quality of rectal cancer excision, as defined by mesorectal grades, achieved by supervised colorectal trainees is comparable with that achieved by consultants.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no significant difference in the quality of mesorectal excision between supervised colorectal trainees and consultants."}
{"answers": "Dutch primary schools could play a more important role in fostering healthy eating habits among children. The school food policy could be improved by clearly formulating food rules, simplifying supervision of the food rules, and defining how to enforce the food rules. In addition, the school food policy will only influence children's dietary behaviour if both the school and the parents support the policy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is room for improvement in the school food policy at Dutch primary schools, according to the study. The policy is not always clearly defined and enforced, and there is a lack of parental involvement in fostering healthy eating habits among children."}
{"answers": "Speed discrimination, per se, is not impaired in schizophrenia patients. The observed abnormality appears to be a consequence of impairment in generating or integrating the feedback information from eye movements. This study introduces a novel approach to motion perception studies and highlights the importance of concurrently measuring eye movements to understand interactions between these two systems; the results argue for a conceptual revision regarding motion perception abnormality in schizophrenia.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that motion perception deficit in schizophrenia is not solely a consequence of eye-tracking abnormality, as there is a correlation between eye movement and motion perception in control subjects but not in patients."}
{"answers": "(1) There is little overlap between regions of CFAEs during AF and regions of SRF measured in the time domain or the frequency domain, (2) the majority of SRF appears to occur in regions with wave-front collision, (3) the distribution of SRF is similar in patients with AF and normal controls, suggesting that this may not have an important role in AF maintenance and may not be a suitable ablation target.", "prediction_text": "There is no significant correlation between complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAEs) recorded during atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm fractionation (SRF) in the left atrium."}
{"answers": "Continence function remained undisturbed after anastomotic leakage due to rectal resection", "prediction_text": "Yes, anastomotic leakage after rectal resection for cancer does affect functional outcome, as there is no significant difference in continence score between patients with and without leakage."}
{"answers": "No evidence was found for OPLL to have any effect on the initial neurologic status or recovery in motor function after traumatic cervical cord injury, suggesting that the neurologic outcome is not significantly dependent on canal space.", "prediction_text": "No, the presence of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) does not significantly affect the neurological outcome after traumatic cervical spinal cord injury."}
{"answers": "Circumferences and related ratios scale significantly to height, notably after adjustment for age and race, across subjects who are representative of the US population. These observations have implications for the clinical and epidemiologic use of these anthropometric measures and indexes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, adult body circumferences (waist circumference (WC) and hip circumference (HC)) are associated with height in adults. The study found that after adjusting for age and race, WC and HC scaled to height with powers of 0.76 \u00b1 0.08 and 0.45 \u00b1 0.05 in men, and 0.80 \u00b1 0.05 and 0.53 \u00b1 0.04 in women, respectively (all P<0.001). This means that for every one-centimeter increase in height, WC and HC increase by approximately 0.76-0"}
{"answers": "We found evidence that pain can be a significant clinical problem in psychiatric patients which seems to be underestimated in psychiatry. The investigated patients in general adult psychiatry are characterized by specific risk factors different from clinical subpopulations of other disciplines.", "prediction_text": "Yes, pain is a clinically relevant problem in general adult psychiatry, with a high prevalence of pain complaints among psychiatric patients, particularly among those with affective disorders and those with a history of depression."}
{"answers": "This study found that influences on coping were multifactorial and moderated by age. These factors have implications for interventions designed to enhance coping strategies.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that age moderates the effect of personality disorder on coping style in psychiatric inpatients. Older adults with personality disorder reported lower levels of dysfunctional coping strategies than younger adults with personality disorder."}
{"answers": "The study data suggests a possible correlation between cervical discopathy and cervical MS plaque.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant correlation between cervical cord plaques and discopathy in patients with multiple sclerosis, with 69.1% of patients having plaques and discopathy at the same site."}
{"answers": "Higher MCVs and AST/ALT ratios in ASH reflect the severity of underlying liver disease and do not differentiate NASH from ASH. Instead, these biomarkers might prove useful in guiding selection of patients for liver biopsy and in targeting therapy.", "prediction_text": "Routine laboratory parameters, including mean corpuscular volume (MCV), AST/ALT ratio, and sex, can be useful in differentiating nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) from alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) in liver biopsies."}
{"answers": "We found no evidence that IBR compromised the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy, although there was a significant incidence of implant infection.", "prediction_text": "No, immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) does not significantly compromise the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy."}
{"answers": "Economic inequalities in breast and cervical cancer screening are low in LMICs with high screening coverage. These findings are consistent with the inverse equity hypothesis and indicate that high levels of equity in cancer screening are feasible even in countries with high income inequality.", "prediction_text": "The inverse equity hypothesis does not apply to coverage of cancer screening in middle-income countries, as economic inequalities in screening participation were substantially lower or non-existent in countries with higher aggregate coverage."}
{"answers": "Post tonsillectomy antibiotics did not prove to have a role in minimizing postoperative morbidity. Moreover, analgesics given on the basis of as required had a limited value.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that postoperative antibiotics did not decrease post-tonsillectomy morbidity, including pain control, fever, secondary hemorrhage, or hospital stay length."}
{"answers": "The study findings suggest that adopting measurement-based care, such as using the PHQ-9, is achievable, even in practices with limited resources.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the systematic use of patient-rated depression severity monitoring through the Nine-Item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) is both helpful and feasible in clinical psychiatry. The study found that all 17 practices adopted PHQ-9 as a routine part of depression care within a year, and 93% of patient contacts were influenced by PHQ-9 scores in clinical decision making. Additionally, 40% of patient contacts resulted in treatment changes, such as changing antidepressant medication dosage or adding psychotherapy.

{"answers": "There is no advantage to an intramedullary nail versus a sliding compression hip screw for low-energy pertrochanteric fractures AO/OTA 31-A1 and A2, specifically with its increased cost and lack of evidence to show decreased complications or improved patient outcome.", "prediction_text": "There is no statistically significant advantage to using an intramedullary nail over a sliding compression hip screw in the treatment of pertrochanteric fractures, based on the results of this study."}
{"answers": "Just over half the patients in this present cohort may be physically able to undertake some aspects of self-managed foot care, including nail clipping and filing, callus filing and daily hygiene and inspection.", "prediction_text": "Only 57% of rheumatoid arthritis patients in the study were physically able to participate in the FOOTSTEP self-management foot care program due to limitations in sight, reach, and grip strength."}
{"answers": "The homogeneity we found in the deprivation-mortality relationship across the regions of Scotland and the absence of a contextualized effect of region highlights the importance of taking a broader strategic policy that can combat the toxic impacts of socio-economic deprivation on health. Focusing on a few specific places (e.g. 15% of the poorest areas) to concentrate resources might be a good start but the impact of socio-economic deprivation on mortality is not restricted to a few places. A comprehensive strategy that can be sustained over time might be needed to interrupt the linkages between poverty and mortality.", "prediction_text": "Yes, context matters for the relationship between deprivation and all-cause mortality. The study found that there are spatial variations in the relationship between deprivation and mortality, with areas in the West of Scotland having higher mortality rates than the rest of the country, even after controlling for deprivation levels."}
{"answers": "This study adds to the growing body of literature documenting the importance of the individual therapist as an important factor in the change process.", "prediction_text": "The study found that approximately 12% of the variability in the outcome of cognitive processing therapy (CPT) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a Veterans Affairs (VA) specialty clinic was due to differences between therapists."}
{"answers": "New depression diagnosis and antidepressant use was shown to be less likely in areas of higher own-ethnic density for some, but not all, ethnic groups.", "prediction_text": "Yes, depression diagnosis and antidepressant prescribing vary by location, with black and minority ethnic groups being less likely to be diagnosed with depression or prescribed antidepressants compared to white British patients. The relationship between neighborhood ethnic density and new depression diagnosis is inverse for some groups, with a higher percentage of own-ethnic density associated with a lower odds of depression for Pakistani, Indian, African, and Bangladeshi patients, but the opposite effect was found for black Caribbean patients."}
{"answers": "These findings suggest a malleable relationship between knee extensor strength, dynamic stability, and disease severity in PD. Although strength is only one piece of the puzzle in the functional outcome of PD, these findings may assist clinicians in designing appropriate interventions aimed at increasing function and decreasing fall risk in PD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, knee extensor strength, dynamic postural stability, and functional ambulation are related in Parkinson's disease. The study found a positive correlation between knee extensor strength and dynamic postural stability, and a negative correlation between knee extensor strength and disease severity. Additionally, dynamic postural stability was found to be negatively correlated with disease severity and positively correlated with functional ambulation."}
{"answers": "It is concluded that preloading colloid fluid prior to repositioning could prevent the decrease of systolic blood pressure and central venous pressure during sitting positioning without other complications.", "prediction_text": "Yes, preloading with colloids before positioning neurosurgical patients can prevent hemodynamic changes when they are subsequently changed to the seated position."}
{"answers": "Data from Safe Implementation of Treatments in Stroke-International Stroke Thrombolysis Register suggest that intravenous thrombolysis may modify the observed survival and recovery advantage for men expected in the natural course of an ischemic stroke, with a possible larger beneficial treatment effect in women when compared with men.", "prediction_text": "Yes, sex influences the response to intravenous thrombolysis in ischemic stroke. Men are more likely to have a better functional outcome and lower mortality rate after treatment, while women are more likely to experience symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage and have a higher mortality rate."}
{"answers": "The rate of early infection without antibiotic prophylaxis before TIVAD placement in the interventional radiology suite is<1%. Based on these data, use of prophylactic antibiotics for TIVAD placement is not recommended.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, prophylactic antibiotics may not be necessary for totally implantable venous access device (TIVAD) placement by interventional radiologists, as the rate of early infection (CLABSI) was low (0.6%) in the study population."}
{"answers": "The PRP group recorded reduced pain, swelling, and trismus as well as enhanced and faster bone healing compared with those in the control. Hence the study showed that topical application of PRP gel has a beneficial effect in enhancing socket healing after third molar surgery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that the application of autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) gel to the socket of mandibular third molars can enhance healing after surgical extraction. The study found that the PRP group had lower postoperative pain scores compared to the control group, and similar results were observed for swelling and maximum mouth opening. Additionally, the PRP group had better scores for lamina dura, trabecular pattern, and bone density on radiographic assessment. However, the differences were not statistically significant, suggesting that further studies are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "This study confirms that physicians often differ from patients in the assessment of QoL. This is most likely due to a difference in patient-physician perception of \"significant\" LUTS and clearly demonstrates the importance of patient evaluated QoL in routine clinical assessment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a discrepancy between patient and physician quality of life assessment in women with lower urinary tract dysfunction. Physicians tend to underestimate the impact of symptoms on patients' quality of life, particularly in domains such as social limitations and emotions."}
{"answers": "Left ventricular dimensions are not influenced by MetS. Rather than MetS, hypertension is primarily responsible for changes in left ventricular dimensions. However, left atrial enlargement is more prominent in patients with MetS, suggesting that each MetS criterion contributes to left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.", "prediction_text": "Yes, accompanying metabolic syndrome contributes to increased heart dimensions in hypertensive patients, specifically in terms of left atrial diameter."}
{"answers": "A higher PV in PMR increases the risk of prolonged steroid therapy and late GCA. Female sex and particular HLA alleles may increase the risk of late GCA. Starting patients on>15 mg prednisolone is associated with a prolonged steroid duration.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the prognosis of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) can be predicted at disease onset based on certain baseline factors. The study found that elevated plasma viscosity (PV) at baseline was associated with a reduced probability of stopping steroids within 5 years (hazard ratio = 0.49, 95% CI 0.29, 0.82). Additionally, starting treatment at >15 mg prednisolone was also associated with a reduced probability of stopping steroids within a given time interval (hazard ratio = 0.63, 95% CI 0.41, 0"}
{"answers": "The study suggests that there is no difference in clinical toxicity profiles or survival outcomes with either definitive chemoradiotherapy or chemoradiation followed by surgery in management of locally advanced esophageal cancer.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that surgical resection may not be necessary for patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus who receive chemoradiotherapy, as the addition of surgery did not significantly improve overall survival or disease-free survival."}
{"answers": "Our results give first evidence that lowered beta E during alcohol withdrawal may contribute to anxiety as a common disturbance during this state.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that withdrawal-induced anxiety in alcoholism may be associated with lowered beta-endorphin (beta E) levels. The study found that beta E levels were significantly lower in alcoholics during acute alcohol withdrawal compared to controls, and that self-rated anxiety decreased significantly between day 1 and day 14 of alcohol withdrawal. Additionally, beta E levels were inversely correlated with anxiety on both days 1 and 14, and this correlation was largely independent of plasma levels of the pituitary-adrenocortical hormone ACTH. However, no association was found between beta E and depression."}
{"answers": "Increased private health care activity does not reduce the demand for NHS care: NHS and private referral rates were positively associated with each other after adjusting for age, deprivation and practice.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that increased use of private healthcare does not reduce the demand for NHS care. In fact, the opposite is true, as the study found that areas with higher private healthcare usage had higher NHS referral rates."}
{"answers": "Skewed X-inactivation is not associated with recurrent spontaneous abortion but is associated with increasing maternal age.", "prediction_text": "There is no significant association between recurrent spontaneous abortion and skewed X-inactivation, except for a trend towards a higher incidence of extreme skewing (90% or greater) in primiparous women."}
{"answers": "Findings suggest that analgesic management of daily pain is better for nursing home residents enrolled in hospice than for those not enrolled in hospice.The prescribing practices portrayed by this study reveal that many dying nursing home residents in daily pain are receiving no analgesic treatment or are receiving analgesic treatment inconsistent with AMDA and other pain management guidelines. Improving the analgesic management of pain in nursing homes is essential if high-quality end-of-life care in nursing homes is to be achieved.", "prediction_text": "Yes, receipt of hospice care in nursing homes improves the management of pain at the end of life. Hospice residents were twice as likely as non-hospice residents to receive regular treatment for daily pain after controlling for clinical confounders."}
{"answers": "The continuity-of-care experiences of vascular trainees are suboptimal. This is especially true for postoperative clinic assessment. Same-day admission surgery accounted for most of the cases and was associated with the poorest continuity of care. To provide complete surgical training in an era of changing therapeutic modalities and same-day admission surgery, vascular programs must be creative in structuring training to include adequate ambulatory experience.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the continuity of care experience of residents in an academic vascular department was suboptimal, with only 57% of patients receiving complete in-hospital continuity of care. Emergent cases were associated with higher rates of preoperative assessment, but elective cases admitted before the day of surgery had lower rates of preoperative assessment and involvement in the decision to operate compared to same-day admission patients."}
{"answers": "Simple detorsion was not accompanied by an increase in morbidity, and all patients studied had functioning ovarian tissue on follow-up despite the surgeon's assessment of the degree of ovarian ischemia. Detorsion is the procedure of choice for most cases of ovarian torsion in children.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that oophorectomy may not be necessary for all children with ovarian torsion, as many ovaries can be treated by detorsion alone."}
{"answers": "Half-dose MR angiography using diluted contrast medium injected at a rate of 1 mL/second depicted the abdominal aorta and its branches as clearly as using a full single dose.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that half-dose contrast-enhanced three-dimensional MR angiography may be sufficient for depicting the abdominal aorta and pelvis, as the signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio of the abdominal aorta and common iliac artery were not significantly different between the half-dose and full-dose groups."}
{"answers": "There was no evidence of a trend in unsafe sex behaviour over time. However, several subgroups were identified as being more likely to report unsafe sex and should be targeted for specific interventions.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no evidence of an increase in reported unsafe sexual behavior among HIV-infected individuals over time, according to the study."}
{"answers": "In normal clinical practice, chemotherapy significantly prolongs survival in patients with performance status of less than 2, more time being gained if there is no associated weight loss. We conclude that the reluctance shown by many pneumologists toward using this treatment is not entirely justified.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that chemotherapy may be beneficial for patients with advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and low performance status (ECOG 0-1), as it is associated with improved survival. However, the skepticism of pneumologists towards chemotherapy in this patient population may be justified, as the study found that only a subset of patients (those with ECOG scores of 0-1) derived a survival benefit from chemotherapy."}
{"answers": "The Medicaid Demonstration in Florida appears to result in lower PMPM expenditures. Demonstration PSNs generated slightly greater reductions in expenditures compared to Demonstration HMOs. PSNs appear to be a promising model for delivering care to Medicaid enrollees.", "prediction_text": "Yes, provider service networks (PSNs) in Florida's Medicaid program result in lower expenditures compared to HMOs. According to the study, PSNs resulted in $7 less in per member per month (PMPM) expenditures compared to HMOs among Supplemental Security Income (SSI) enrollees, and to a lesser extent among Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) enrollees."}
{"answers": "In this series, in accordance to available testosterone, the prevalence of PADAM was determined to be high, in which the ADAM questionnaire rendered a low diagnostic efficiency. PADAM diagnosis could be clinically suspected when symptoms of sexual dysfunction are present.", "prediction_text": "The Androgen Deficiency of Aging Men (ADAM) questionnaire is not a reliable tool for the screening of partial androgenic deficiency of aging men, with a low sensitivity and specificity. Item 1 of the ADAM questionnaire (decreased sexual desire) is a better predictor of hypogonadism than the complete questionnaire."}
{"answers": "We found that intrapartum VAS was an effective predictor of fetal acidosis in cases of FHR variable decelerations, but its predictability for fetal acidosis in cases of FHR late decelerations was limited. Both VAS and fetal blood pH are good predictors of neonatal morbidity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that intrapartum vibroacoustic stimulation (VAS) is an effective predictor of fetal acidosis during labor. The study found that a negative response to VAS (no acceleration or decelerations) was associated with a low fetal blood pH (pH<7.20) in both term and preterm gestations. The positive predictive value of fetal acidosis was 67% in both groups of FHR variable decelerations and late decelerations, but the false negative rate of acceleration VAS response for predicting no acidosis was significantly higher in the group of late decelerations. Additionally, both a negative VAS"}
{"answers": "Emergency US fellowship programs had a positive impact on residents' US educational experiences. Emergency medicine residents performed more scans overall and also used bedside US for more advanced applications in programs with EUS fellowships.", "prediction_text": "Yes, emergency ultrasound fellowship programs have a significant impact on emergency medicine residents' ultrasound education, with residents in programs with fellowships performing more scans and reporting more applications of bedside ultrasound compared to those in programs without fellowships."}
{"answers": "Obesity does not seem to impact the severity of injury, mortality rate, types of injury, and procedure outcomes in children. Obese patients are more likely to have rib and pelvic injuries.", "prediction_text": "Yes, obesity impacts the pattern and outcome of trauma in children. Obese children were found to be older, have higher injury severity scores, lower pediatric trauma scores, lower heart rates, and lower respiratory rates compared to non-obese children. They were also more likely to have rib fractures and pelvic injuries. There was no significant association between mortality and obesity."}
{"answers": "The laparoscopic-assisted approach to Crohn's disease is feasible and safe with good outcomes. Co-morbid preoperative findings such as abscess, phlegmon, or recurrent disease at the previous ileocolic anastomosis are not contraindications to a successful laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resection in select patients.", "prediction_text": "No, abscesses, phlegmons, or recurrent disease at a previous ileocolic anastomosis are not contraindications for laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resections in patients with Crohn's disease. In fact, the study found that laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resections were associated with less operative blood loss, shorter operating time, and lower morbidity compared to open ileocolic resections in these patients."}
{"answers": "When controlling for preoperative features, the year in which RP was performed is a predictor of outcome on multivariate analysis. This effect could not be explained by stage migration.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the year of radical prostatectomy (RP) is a predictor of treatment outcome in prostate cancer, with better outcomes observed in patients undergoing surgery in the mid-1990s compared to earlier or later periods."}
{"answers": "The menopausal transition warrants attention as a period of vulnerability to MDD recurrence, while health factors and VMS should be considered important risk factors for first lifetime-onset of MDD during midlife.", "prediction_text": "The study found that women without a prior history of major depression (MDD) had a lower risk of developing MDD during midlife compared to those with a prior history, and their risk profiles differed. Specifically, health conditions prior to baseline and during follow-ups, perception of functioning, and vasomotor symptoms (VMS) were risk factors for first lifetime-onset MDD, while being peri- and post-menopausal, psychological symptoms, and a prior anxiety disorder were predominant risk factors for MDD recurrence."}
{"answers": "Most children undergoing congenital heart surgery can be extubated in the operating room. Most neonates, including many undergoing complex procedures, can be extubated within the first 24 hours after surgery. Early extubation was associated with low morbidity rates and short lengths of intensive care unit and hospital stays.", "prediction_text": "Yes, early extubation (within 24 hours) should be the goal for children after congenital cardiac surgery, as it is associated with lower mortality and a lower rate of reintubation compared to delayed extubation."}
{"answers": "A significant association between farming and PSV has been identified for the first time. Results also support previously reported associations with silica, solvents, and allergy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, environmental factors are important in primary systemic vasculitis (PSV). The study found significant associations between PSV and several environmental factors, including farming in the index year and during working lifetime, high occupational silica and solvent exposure in the index year and during working lifetime, drug allergy, and overall allergy. These findings suggest that environmental exposures may play a role in the development of PSV."}
{"answers": "This study that shows that adequate femoral tunnel lengths can be safely created without knee hyperflex - ion using flexible instruments via an anteromedial portal.", "prediction_text": "The study found that flexible instruments can create adequate femoral tunnel lengths for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction at 90\u00b0 of knee flexion. The mean intra-osseous length measured in the study was 25.2 mm at 70\u00b0 flexion, which increased to 32.1 mm and 38.0 mm at 90\u00b0 and 120\u00b0 flexion, respectively. However, there was no significant difference in the distance to the lateral structures, including the common peroneal nerve, among the three flexion groups."}
{"answers": "A proportionally longer treatment duration was identified as an adverse factor in low-risk patients. Treatment breaks resulting in a NTDR of>/=33% (e.g., four or more breaks during a 40-fraction treatment, 5 d/wk) should be avoided.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the duration of external beam radiotherapy (RT) treatment is a significant predictor of outcome in prostate cancer, with longer treatment times associated with lower freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF) rates."}
{"answers": "TEE allowed a diagnosis of site involvement that did correlate with the anatomic diagnosis obtained during the operation. This fact contributed to the management of patients and was of great help in guiding the surgical intervention. Echo-oriented single-valve replacement may be a safe strategy for patients with PVE and double prostheses.", "prediction_text": "Single-valve replacement in patients with double prostheses may not be safe, as 4 out of 13 patients who underwent single-valve replacement died within a week after the procedure."}
{"answers": "Acute hepatitis C in the post universal blood products screening era was found to be predominantly an iatrogenic disease in the investigated localities. This finding should direct attention and resources towards the development and implementation of preventive measures.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that acute hepatitis C in Israel is predominantly transmitted via iatrogenic means, with the majority of cases (65%) resulting from minimal procedures and clinical settings."}
{"answers": "Our results suggest a protective effect of breast-feeding among children with a family history of atopy that is not confined to the period of breast-feeding but continues during the first three years of life. Breast-feeding should be promoted in children with a family history of atopy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that breast-feeding may provide protection against illness in children with a family history of atopy."}
{"answers": "Transrectal ultrasound guided and fusion biopsy cancer detection rates decreased with increasing prostate volume. However, magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy had a higher prostate cancer detection rate compared to that of transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy in the literature. Magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy represents a promising solution for patients with suspicion of prostate cancer and an enlarged prostate.", "prediction_text": "Yes, magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy can improve cancer detection in enlarged prostates, with an overall detection rate of 55% and a significant inverse association between prostate volume and cancer detection."}
{"answers": "There is no difference in postoperative morbidity, rates of rehospitalization, in-patient mortality or hospitalization costs in geriatric patients undergoing regional or general anesthesia for repair of hip fracture. Delay in surgery beyond 3 days and ICU admission both increase cost of hospitalization.", "prediction_text": "No, regional anesthesia does not appear to decrease morbidity, mortality, or healthcare costs in geriatric patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture compared to general anesthesia."}
{"answers": "Mesocolon invasion should be included in T4 for the staging of gastric cancer.", "prediction_text": "Yes, direct mesocolon invasion should be included in the T4 category for the staging of gastric cancer, based on the findings of this study."}

{"answers": "The Turkish version of the EQ-5D-based utility score seems to be a valid instrument in the assessment of quality of life studies in patients with acute coronary syndrome.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the EQ-5D is a valid quality of life instrument in patients with acute coronary syndrome, as it shows significant correlations with the MacNew heart-related quality of life scale."}
{"answers": "We found an improved survival associated with cardiologist care and a mixture of general practitioner and cardiologist care compared with general practitioner care. The pattern of outpatient care may therefore be important for the survival of patients with CHF.", "prediction_text": "Yes, specialty care (cardiology) is associated with improved survival of patients with congestive heart failure, compared to general medicine care alone. The risk of death was significantly higher in patients who received only general medicine care (GM-only) and those who did not receive any specialty care (no-GM/CARD), and the risk was lowest in patients who received both general medicine and cardiology care (MIXED group)."}
{"answers": "Comparison of mother-offspring and father-offspring associations for BMI suggests that intergenerational acceleration mechanisms do not make an important contribution to levels of childhood BMI within the population. Associations at later ages and for different components of body composition now require study.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is evidence to suggest that there is an intrauterine influence on obesity, as the study found that the association between maternal and paternal body mass index (BMI) and offspring BMI at age 7.5 was similar. This suggests that the intrauterine environment may play a role in the development of obesity in offspring."}
{"answers": "TEE is useful to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors. An FAC less than 50% is present in 36% of potential heart donors. Because left ventricular dysfunction is often reversible shortly after transplantation, an FAC below 50% may not necessarily preclude the use of hearts for transplantation.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) can be used to assess left ventricular function in brain-dead donors and may help identify hearts that are suitable for transplantation, even if they do not meet conventional criteria for donor heart quality. Of the 55 potential donors evaluated, 20 (36%) had an echocardiographic fractional area change (FAC) of less than 50%, which is considered a threshold for acceptable left ventricular function. However, the study found that 4 (9%) of the 40 hearts harvested from these donors were not suitable for transplantation due to hemorrh"}
{"answers": "Pediatricians should be alert to the earliest manifestations of AEA. Awareness of choking games among the young and, of those, a subset who eventually progress to potentially fatal AEA is strongly encouraged among all primary care professionals who may be able to interrupt the behavior.", "prediction_text": "Yes, autoerotic asphyxiation (AEA) can lead to unintended death due to the clandestine and elusive nature of the practice."}
{"answers": "The whole-body MRI protocol for the detection of bone metastases could safely be limited to the T1w sequence in adults, especially at 3 T. There is no need for an additional STIR sequence. These initial results will have a major impact on the department's workflow if confirmed by larger studies as they will help reduce examination time and therefore save financial resources.", "prediction_text": "No, STIR imaging cannot be omitted for the diagnosis of bone metastases at 1.5 T and 3 T. The study found that T1-weighted (T1w) sequences have a higher sensitivity and specificity than STIR sequences for detecting bone metastases, with a significant difference in the number of metastases detected between the two sequences at both field strengths (p < 0.05)."}

Pregnancy may have possible protective mechanisms for kidney against adverse effects of glomerular hyperfiltration.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that women with more parities (four or more) have significantly higher glomerular filtration rates (GFR) compared to those with no or one parity, which may suggest potential kidney damage."}
{"answers": "Implant coating with an antibacterial-loaded hydrogel reduces bacterial colonization and biofilm formation in vitro.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the antibacterial-loaded hydrogel was able to deliver antibacterial compounds in vitro and reduce bacterial colonization and biofilm formation on implants."}
{"answers": "Location of death varies by country of birth. BAME groups are more likely to die in a hospital and less likely to die at home or in a hospice. Further investigation is needed to determine whether these differences result from patient-centred preferences, or other environment or service-related factors. This knowledge will enable strategies to be developed to improve access to relevant palliative care and related services, where necessary.", "prediction_text": "Yes, ethnicity affects where people with cancer die. The study found that individuals from certain ethnic groups were more likely to die in hospitals, while others were more likely to die at home. Specifically, those born in Asia and Africa were more likely to die in hospitals, while those born in the Caribbean were less likely to die at home."}
{"answers": "Overall, 7% of women in our cohort met either clinical or molecular criteria for Lynch syndrome. All of these women had a prior history or a first-degree relative with an HNPCC-associated cancer. Limiting genetic evaluation to women with synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancer who have a family history suggestive of HNPCC may appropriately identify women with Lynch syndrome.", "prediction_text": "Yes, women with synchronous primary cancers of the endometrium and ovary have a high likelihood of having Lynch syndrome (Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer), with 5 out of 59 patients (8.5%) found to have a germline mutation in MSH2, MSH6, or MLH1."}
{"answers": "CMV-IgM and IgG antibodies assessment was not a potential discriminative test to identify congenitally infected newborns. In addition, low birth weight and small head circumference at birth failed to predict congenital CMV infection. CMV-DNA detection in umbilical cord blood at the time of delivery using real-time PCR of all newborns is recommended as decisive, rapid and non-invasive test.", "prediction_text": "Yes, low birth weight is a risk indicator for congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, as detected by detecting CMV-DNA in umbilical cord blood at the time of delivery."}
{"answers": "The use of instrumental variables allowed us to demonstrate a significant relationship between better ambulatory process of care and better health-related quality of life. This finding underscores the importance of efforts to improve the process of care.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that better ambulatory process of care is associated with better health-related quality of life outcomes for patients with chronic disease. Specifically, the study found that patients who received better process of care had smaller declines in health-related quality of life scores over a 30-month observation window, and that the application of the best quartile of process of care to patients currently receiving poor process was associated with a 4.24 increment in health-related quality of life outcomes."}
{"answers": "To date, the newly developed Singapore equation is the most accurate BMR prediction equation in Chinese and is applicable for use in a large BMI range including those overweight and obese.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the currently available prediction equations for basal metabolic rate (BMR) in Chinese adults are not entirely applicable, and a new equation was developed and validated in a large BMI range. The new equation, which includes gender, weight, and BMI, showed an accuracy rate of 78% in predicting BMR, which is comparable to other equations. However, for BMIs greater than 23, the Singapore equation reached an accuracy rate of 76%. Cross-validation of the equation in a separate group of subjects showed an accuracy rate of 80%. Therefore, the study suggests that the new equation may be a useful tool for estimating BMR in Chinese adults"}
{"answers": "This preliminary study demonstrated that OSCE ratings by LEs and REs were reasonably comparable when using checklists. Remote examination may be a feasible and acceptable way of assessing students' clinical skills, but further validity evidence will be required before it can be recommended for use in high-stakes examinations.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that remote physician-examiners can replace on-site physician-examiners in an OSCE, with statistically significant correlations found between local and remote examiners' scores on several stations."}
{"answers": "ACR is an independent prognostic factor for maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes in suspected preeclampsia. ACR may be useful to inform risk predictions within a prognostic model.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the first urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) in women with suspected preeclampsia is a prognostic factor for both maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes."}

{"answers": "The observations from this study provide limited support for the possibility that occupational arsenic exposure could play a role in the development of diabetes mellitus. Many other metallic compounds are also used in art glass production, however, and there is a possibility of confounding.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found an increased risk of diabetes mellitus among Swedish art glass workers, particularly among those with high exposure to arsenic."}
{"answers": "Hospital preparedness can be better defined by a fixed number of casualties rather than a percentile of its bed capacity. Only 20% of the arriving casualties will require immediate medical treatment. Implementation of this concept may improve the utilisation of national emergency health resources both in the preparation phase and on real time.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the current readiness guidelines for hospitals in Israel may not accurately predict the surge capacity and injury severity distribution in terrorism-related multiple casualty incidents."}
{"answers": "While Italian primary care physicians appropriately target eradication therapy for H pylori infection in patients with peptic ulcer disease rather than nonulcer disease, the intervention was still underused in these patients. Improvements in this prescribing behavior are needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that primary care physicians underprescribe antibiotics for peptic ulcer disease (PUD). Only 10% of patients with PUD received eradication therapy, and the frequency of eradication therapy was significantly lower in patients with a presumptive diagnosis of PUD (20.3%) than in those with a definitive diagnosis (37.7%). Similarly, only 2% of patients with nonulcer dyspepsia (NUD) received eradication therapy, with a significant difference between patients with a definitive diagnosis (0.9%) and those with a presumptive diagnosis (2.2%)."}
{"answers": "When cerebral hemispherectomy is performed to control seizures associated with very early (in utero) insult, it has been found that the remaining right hemisphere is still able to support reading and phonological processing skills that are normally mediated by the left hemisphere. Our results also suggest the existence of variability in individuals after hemispherectomy, even within groups having the same etiology and similar timing of insult.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the isolated right hemisphere can read to some extent, as the study found that about 60% of participants developed both word reading and paragraph reading skills in the average range, despite the fact that the left hemisphere was resected. Additionally, phonological awareness and verbal memory, which are components of phonological processing, were found to be spared in the majority of participants, and were positively correlated with reading levels."}

Larger studies are needed to validate these findings and to explore possible mechanisms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patient coaching can reduce racial/ethnic disparities in cancer pain control."}
{"answers": "The association between plasma glucose levels and CVD risk is mainly explained by insulin resistance, which raises the question of whether glucose lowering per se without changes in the processes that underlie hyperglycemia should be the sole clinical paradigm in the treatment of type 2 diabetes or its prevention.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that insulin resistance drives the association between hyperglycemia and cardiovascular risk. Adjusting for insulin sensitivity eliminated the association between fasting glucose and cardiovascular risk, and the association between 2-hour glucose and cardiovascular risk disappeared when adjusting for both insulin sensitivity and fasting glucose. Insulin sensitivity, on the other hand, remained significantly associated with cardiovascular risk after adjusting for glucose levels."}
{"answers": "Tracheobronchoscopy is a useful and safe procedure and should be recommended in tertiary centers for babies with EA before surgical repair.", "prediction_text": "Yes, preoperative tracheobronchoscopy (TBS) can be clinically useful in newborns with esophageal atresia (EA), particularly in modifying the surgical approach. In this study, TBS identified unsuspected proximal fistulas in 3 of 9 type A patients and undetected malformations of the respiratory tree in 4 patients. The procedure was also useful in occluding carinal fistulas in 14 type C patients to improve ventilation during repair, with no complications observed. Overall, TBS was found to be clinically useful in 28 (45.2%) of 62 patients, including"}
{"answers": "The recently released seventh edition of the primary tumor staging system for kidney tumors is a powerful predictor of CSS. However, some of the substages identified by the classification have overlapping prognoses, and other substages include patients with heterogeneous outcomes. The few modifications included in this edition may have not resolved the most critical issues in the previous version.", "prediction_text": "The validation of the 2009 TNM version for primary tumor classification in kidney cancer in a large multi-institutional cohort suggests that further improvements are needed."}
{"answers": "The Young-Burgess system is useful for predicting transfusion requirements. For the system to predict mortality or nonorthopaedic injuries, fractures must be divided into stable (APC1, LC1) and unstable (APC2, APC3, LC2, LC3, VS, combined mechanism of injury) types. LC1 injuries are very common and not always benign (overall mortality rate, 8.2%).", "prediction_text": "The Young-Burgess classification system does not significantly predict mortality, transfusion requirements, or non-orthopaedic injuries in patients with pelvic ring fractures."}
{"answers": "Parity is not directly linked to insulin sensitivity deterioration, to CP/FPG increase during pregnancy, or to GDM appearance, although it is linked through the mediation of progressive ageing and weight gain either before or during pregnancy, when there is a sufficiently long time interval between pregnancies.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that parity (number of previous pregnancies) is associated with decreased insulin sensitivity during pregnancy, as measured by the peripheral insulin sensitivity index (ISI(OGTT)) and an increased risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)."}
{"answers": "The relationship between cognitive functioning and recognition of frequency compressed speech-in-noise was not statistically significant. The findings may have been different if the participants had been provided with training and/or time to 'acclimatize' to the frequency-compressed conditions.", "prediction_text": "Yes, cognitive function predicts frequency-compressed speech recognition in listeners with normal hearing and normal cognition."}
{"answers": "We conclude that beta1Gly49 homozygosity and TACC haplotype of ADRB2 gene, both loss-of-function genetic variations, may predispose to TTN.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that polymorphisms in the beta-adrenergic receptor (ADRB) encoding genes, specifically the beta1Gly49 homozygotes, may play a role in the development of transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN)."}
{"answers": "MSWM does not appear to confer additional benefit as compared to the standard preoperative bariatric surgery protocol in terms of weight loss and most behavioral outcomes after LAGB in our patient population.", "prediction_text": "No, participation in a medically supervised weight loss program before bariatric surgery does not improve weight loss outcomes after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) in a publicly insured population."}
{"answers": "TAVI can be performed safely without balloon predilatation and with the same early results as achieved with the standard procedure including balloon predilatation. The reduction in the number of pacing periods required may be beneficial for the patient.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that balloon predilatation may not be necessary in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVI) procedures."}
{"answers": "In our study; sex is not a significant predictor of recanalization rate, time to recanalization or 3-month outcome in stroke patients following IV rt-PA.", "prediction_text": "No, the sex of acute stroke patients does not influence the effectiveness of rt-PA treatment."}
{"answers": "Serum sample might be alternatively used in the difficult time of getting tumor tissue for analyzing the status of EGFR mutation status in patients with advanced NSCLC.", "prediction_text": "Yes, serum can be used for analyzing the EGFR mutation status in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study found that EGFR mutations were detected in the serum samples of 11 patients and in the tumor samples of 12 patients, with a high correlation between the mutations detected in serum and tumor samples (87.7%). Additionally, the response to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors was significantly associated with EGFR mutations in both serum and tumor samples."}
{"answers": "Although the provision of high-quality evidence-based resources, electronic or otherwise, is essential for standardizing care and improving patient outcomes, the authors' findings demonstrate that this alone does not ensure uptake. It is important to understand end-users, the environment in which they operate, and the basic infrastructure required to implement such a system. Implementation must also be accompanied by continuing education and endorsement to ensure both long-term sustainability and use of the system to its full potential.", "prediction_text": "The use of Web-based systems in medical oncology is not universally adopted in the Australian setting due to various factors, including clinician-specific and environmental factors. While the Web-based system plays a major role in guiding oncology treatment, its use varies across hospitals and clinicians, highlighting the need for further standardization and support."}
{"answers": "This study has shown that being SGA was not a significant risk factor for any stage ROP or for severe ROP in this cohort and, also, that the risk factors for ROP were similar among SGA and AGA very-low-birth-weight preterm babies.", "prediction_text": "Yes, being small for gestational age (SGA) is a risk factor for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in preterm infants. According to the study, SGA infants had a higher prevalence of ROP compared to appropriate for gestational age (AGA) infants."}

The study found that the cumulative primary patency rate was 60.3% at 1 year and 48.4% at 3 years, and the limb salvage rate was 68.6% at 1 and 3 years."}
{"answers": "Although the SLBM is quite repeatable, it underestimates mesopic pupil size and shows a too wide range of agreement with CIP. SLBM shows low sensitivity in detecting pupils larger than 6\u00a0mm, which may be misleading when planning anterior segment surgery. Previous grading-consensus training strategies may increase interrater reproducibility, and compensation for the systematic underestimation could improve accuracy of the SLBM.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the cobalt blue light slit-lamp biomicroscopy method (SLBM) can measure mesopic pupil size, but with lower accuracy compared to Colvard infrared pupillometry (CIP). The mean difference between SLBM and CIP was -0.60 mm and -0.30 mm for each examiner using the average of the three readings, and the intraobserver reproducibility was good (ICCs ranged from 0.97 to 0.92). However, the interobserver reproducibility was lower (kappa statistics ranged from 0.39 to 0.49"}

The study found that:"}
{"answers": "A set of educational interventions designed for cancer patients significantly improved their satisfaction with information on clinical research, but did not improve clinical trial enrollment of these participants as of 1 year after the study.", "prediction_text": "No, increased patient awareness does not necessarily lead to an increase in accrual into cancer-related clinical trials."}
{"answers": "There was little evidence that people at high risk of falls received systematic falls risk assessment during rehabilitation. When a risk was identified, generally a strategy was implemented. However, failure to assess some risk factors might have limited fall prevention strategies offered. Failure to adequately address risks during hospitalization could contribute to falls post-discharge. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2016; 16: 570-576.", "prediction_text": "The study found that discharge documentation did not accurately identify falls risk for most patients, and there was limited assessment and implementation of fall prevention strategies. Only 9 out of 50 patients had their falls risk correctly identified in their discharge documentation. Additionally, there was a lack of assessment for certain fall risk factors, such as osteoporosis, footwear, and visual assessment in the previous 2 years. Overall, the study suggests that the guidelines for preparing patients at high risk of falls for discharge home after rehabilitation are not being met."}
{"answers": "Although most Medicare beneficiaries who received a new CIED between 2005 and 2009 did not have an initial in-person CIED follow-up visit within 2 to 12 weeks after device implantation, the rate of initial follow-up improved appreciably over time. This CIED follow-up visit was significantly more common in white patients than in patients of other races.", "prediction_text": "The study found that there is a significant variation in follow-up rates of patients with new cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) among different patient factors and over time, but the rates of in-person follow-up visits within 2 to 12 weeks, 0 to 16 weeks, and 1 year after implantation are not consistent with the 2008 expert consensus statement recommendations."}
{"answers": "According to our study, there is a great variability when different brands and models of scanners are compared directly. Furthermore, the CT scan analysis and HU evaluation appears to gather insufficient information in order to characterize and identify the composition of renal stones.", "prediction_text": "There are significant differences in CT attenuation values for different types of urinary stones among different CT scanner models, which can lead to pitfalls in accurate stone identification."}
{"answers": "Ophthalmic pathology and basic science research show that SBK and ASA are improvements in excimer laser keratorefractive surgery compared to conventional LASIK or PRK, particularly with regard to maintaining corneal biomechanics and perhaps moderately reducing the risk of corneal haze. However, most of the disadvantages caused by wound healing issues remain.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there are differences in the biomechanical and wound healing characteristics of corneas after excimer laser keratorefractive surgery between advanced surface ablation (ASA) and sub-Bowman's keratomileusis (SBK). The study found that ASA resulted in stronger and more rigid corneas, particularly in the anterior and peripheral regions, compared to SBK. This suggests that ASA may be biomechanically safer than SBK in reducing the risk of keratectasia after surgery. However, both techniques still have limitations due to inadequate reparative wound healing in the adult human cornea."}

{"answers": "Ultrasound not only has comparable sensitivity to that of X-ray for the identification of limb fractures but is also equally effective for the diagnosis of fracture type and dislocation. Thus, ultrasound can be used as an adequate alternative method to X-ray for pediatric fracture diagnosis.", "prediction_text": "No, ultrasound is not equal to X-ray in pediatric fracture diagnosis. While ultrasound was superior to X-ray in detecting dislocations, X-ray was more accurate in identifying fracture type."}
{"answers": "Although initial infection control rate was substantially lower in the retention group than the removal group, final results were comparable at latest followup. We believe retention treatment can be selectively considered for non-S. aureus infection, and when applied in selected patients, polyethylene exchange should be performed.", "prediction_text": "Based on the study, implant retention may not be recommended for the treatment of infected total knee arthroplasty (TKA) as the infection control rate was lower in the retention group compared to the removal group, and the type of treatment was the only factor associated with infection control."}
{"answers": "The observed socioeconomic, demographic and microbiological differences between unmarried and married women could be responsible for the poor pregnancy outcome among unmarried pregnant women in Poland. Unmarried pregnant women should be covered by comprehensive medical care even before pregnancy. Further studies taking into account the role of psychological stress, patterns of sexual behavior and substance abuse during pregnancy could help identify the factors responsible for adverse pregnancy outcome among unmarried pregnant women.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that microbiological factors, specifically the presence of Mycoplasma hominis, may account for poor pregnancy outcome among unmarried pregnant women in Poland."}
{"answers": "In conclusion, concept mapping has a positive effect on students' academic achievement.

{"answers": "Although the cost-effectiveness of a single-pill strategy was within the acceptable willingness-to-pay threshold, the QALY difference were minimal. Further research is recommended to explore the long-term impact of the strategy.", "prediction_text": "The study found that combining antiretroviral agents in a single dosage form (FXD) did not significantly enhance the quality of life of HIV/AIDS patients compared to the multiple free dose combination (FRC) strategy, as measured by SF-6D scores. The mean utility gained by using FXD over FRC was 0.085, but this difference was not statistically significant."}
{"answers": "2ME is able to enhance the antiproliferative activity of certain chemotherapeutics at pharmacological relevant concentrations. This estradiol metabolite is currently in a phase II trial in patients with refractary metastatic breast cancer and the tolerability has been shown to be very good. The combination of 2ME with chemotherapeutics may therefore offer a new clinically relevant treatment regimen for hormone-dependent cancer.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the combination of 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME) with certain chemotherapeutic compounds can result in an additive inhibitory effect on the proliferation of human ovarian cancer cells, potentially reducing the dosages of these chemotherapeutics in the treatment of ovarian cancer."}
{"answers": "Follow-up after endometrial cancer treatment varies in Italy. In this retrospective study, women with asymptomatic recurrence have shown a better clinical outcome compared with those with symptomatic relapse. The optimal approach is actually unknown, and guidelines comparing follow-up protocols have not been established. Prospective cost-effectiveness studies are needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, different follow-up modalities can play a role in the diagnosis of asymptomatic endometrial cancer relapses. The study found that among the 165 asymptomatic patients, 60 (36.4%) were detected through a clinical visit alone, 103 (62.4%) through imaging, and 2 (1.2%) through cytologic examination. The presence of symptoms at recurrence can predict survival, with patients with an asymptomatic recurrence having a median survival time of 35 months compared to 13 months for symptomatic relapses (P = 0.0001)."}
{"answers": "Lower Infundibular height could be a good measurement tool for deciding which patients with lower calyceal lithiasis would benefit from SWL treatment. Height of less than 22 mm suggests a good outcome from lithotripsy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, infundibular height can predict the clearance of lower pole calyceal stones after extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy."}
{"answers": "The interval from the onset of clinical symptoms to the initial surgical intervention seems to be the most important prognostic factor with a significant impact on outcome. Despite extensive therapeutic efforts, Fournier's gangrene remains a surgical emergency and early recognition with prompt radical debridement is the mainstays of management.", "prediction_text": "Yes, Fournier's gangrene is still a dangerous condition, with a mortality rate of 36% in the study population, despite the use of antibiotics and aggressive debridement. Leukocyte count was found to be a significant predictor of mortality."}
{"answers": "These four cases may belong to a variant form of HAM/TSP, predominantly involving the cervical cord levels.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that chronic progressive cervical myelopathy can be a variant form of HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP)."}
{"answers": "The results of the current study demonstrated that there are factors that increase the risk of a leakage which would enable surgeons to define risk groups, to more carefully select patients, and to offer a closer follow-up during the postoperative course with early recognition and adequate treatment. All future efforts should be focused on a further reduction of serious complications to make the LSG a widely accepted and safer procedure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, several risk factors have been identified in the study as increasing the rate of staple line leakage in patients undergoing primary sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity.

{"answers": "Present audit shows that the process of implementation of labor analgesia was quick, successful and safe, notwithstanding the identification of one cluster of women with suboptimal response to epidural analgesia that need to be further studies, overall pregnant womens'adhesion to labor analgesia was satisfactory.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the standard of effective analgesia for epidural analgesia during labor can be reached in a significant proportion of women, with an increase in the use of epidural analgesia from 15.5% to 51% over the study period. However, there was a clustering of patients into two groups based on their VAS time course, with one group experiencing a greater reduction in pain levels after epidural analgesia."}
{"answers": "The residency training sites of the Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine provide patient care opportunities similar to those found in a national survey of family and general practitioners.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the patient characteristics and reasons for visits at family medicine residency teaching sites in northeast Ohio were similar to those of family physicians (FPs) and general practitioners (GPs) in the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) for 1990. The residency training sites saw slightly more children, women, blacks, and Medicare and Medicaid patients, but the most common reasons for office visits were identical, and the top 20 diagnoses were also similar. However, more preventive and therapeutic services were offered or performed at the residency training sites, while fewer diagnostic services were performed, and there were"}
{"answers": "Our findings suggest that, in HT+ postmenopausal women, the rs2813544 polymorphism may influence LDL-C levels and, as previously described, ESR2 rs1256049 is associated with T-chol and LDL-C. No previous study has investigated the association of this SNP set with lipoprotein levels in women while taking into account the hormonal status of the patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, polymorphisms in the oestrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) and oestrogen receptor 2 (ESR2) genes are associated with lipid levels in response to hormone therapy (HT) in postmenopausal women. Specifically, the ESR1 rs2813544 polymorphism was associated with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in HT-treated postmenopausal women, while one ESR2 gene haplotype was associated with total cholesterol (T-chol) and LDL-C in HT-treated postmenopausal women."}
{"answers": "The prevalence of PAD is high in nursing home residents. AAI is not predictive for IHD mortality in this population. In very frail elderly traditional risk factors and PAD are less important predictors of death compared to poor functional status, nutritional factors and previous cardiovascular disease.", "prediction_text": "No, the presence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) as determined by ankle/arm blood pressure index (AAI) was not predictive of cardiovascular mortality in older patients living in nursing homes."}
{"answers": "The data demonstrate that vaccination has a relatively weak and short-lasting effect in old age. The results of the study should stimulate discussions about strategies how vaccinations can be made more effective in old age. Improved campaigns, shortened vaccination intervals as well as the design of novel vaccines tailored to fulfill the specific demands of the aging immune system are imaginable.", "prediction_text": "The study found that elderly Austrian individuals (>60 years old) are not adequately protected against infectious diseases by vaccination, with insufficient protection observed in both frail and healthy elderly individuals."}
{"answers": "The introduction of a discharge coordinator improved the quality of discharge planning, but at additional cost.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the introduction of a dedicated discharge coordinator resulted in an improved discharge planning process and a reduction in problems experienced by patients after discharge, as well as a reduction in the perceived need for medical and healthcare services."}

This could result in reduced costs and a reduced risk of adverse reactions, without an impact on patient comfort.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, local anesthesia is not necessary for MR arthrography (MRa) of the shoulder as there was no significant difference in pain intensity between groups that received local anesthesia and those that did not."}
{"answers": "A routinely inserted ENBD tube did not improve the clinical course, despite patients having to endure increased procedure time and discomfort, and the insertion would therefore be unnecessary.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that inserting a nasobiliary drainage tube (ENBD) after endoscopic clearance of the common bile duct (CBD) in patients with choledocholithiasis-induced cholangitis is not necessary to improve clinical outcomes. The study found no significant differences in the recurrence rate of cholangitis or length of hospital stay between the ENBD group and the no-ENBD group at 24 weeks after treatment. However, the procedure time was longer and the discomfort score was higher in the ENBD group."}
{"answers": "Regarding the pedigree, we discuss different modes of inheritance. The presence of consanguineous unions in this family suggests the possibility of a common ancestor and thus a recessive autosomal mode of inheritance.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is evidence to suggest that nasal polyposis (NP) may have an inherited pattern. In this study, 19.7% of individuals older than 17 years in a family were affected by NP, which is significantly higher than the national French prevalence of 2.1%."}
{"answers": "Emergency DBE is feasible, safe and effective in acute OGIB and may avoid major surgery, diagnosing and successfully treating most patients. Combined approach with RT viewing by CE is especially useful to identify recurrent bleeding vascular lesions such as DL that may be easily misdiagnosed by non-emergency DBE.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the combination of emergency double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) with real-time viewing of capsule endoscopy (CE) is a feasible approach in the management of acute overt-obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB).

{"answers": "Overall, in a US Air Force population, OSA does not predict a decrease in aerobic fitness as measured by cycle ergometry. However, patients with an apnea-hypopnea index of greater than 20 have a statistically significant decrease in aerobic fitness compared to the normal population. This study demonstrates the effects of OSA on aerobic fitness. Further correlation of fitness testing results with OSA severity and treatment is needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with decreased aerobic fitness, as demonstrated by a lower maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max) compared to a normal population."}
{"answers": "Pictorial HWLs with didactic textual forms seem to work better than those with testimonial narratives. Future research should determine which pictorial HWL content has the greatest real-world impact among consumers from disadvantaged groups, including assessment of how HWL content should change to maintain its impact as tobacco control environments strengthen and consumer awareness of smoking-related risks increases.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that pictorial health warning labels (HWLs) on cigarette packages can be effective in addressing smoking-related health disparities, particularly among individuals with higher levels of educational attainment. Didactic textual forms and graphic imagery of diseased organs were found to be more effective than testimonial narratives and human suffering imagery, respectively. However, the impact of HWLs may be weaker among individuals with lower levels of educational attainment, highlighting the need for targeted interventions to address these disparities."}
{"answers": "Preferential transmission of AVPR1A to hypersexual or uninhibited people-seeking probands was not supported.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no significant evidence to suggest that the arginine vasopressin V1a receptor microsatellites are related to hypersexuality in children with a prepubertal and early adolescent bipolar disorder phenotype. The study found no preferential transmission of the AVPR1A microsatellites to hypersexual and uninhibited people-seeking probands, and no significant associations between the number of AVPR1A repeats and hypersexuality or uninhibited people-seeking in either case-control or family-based association analyses."}
{"answers": "We suggest that regardless of family history, all children over 5 years should be screened for hyperlipidemia. Education about hyperlipidemia and precautions for its complications should be given to both children and families. The best and easiest way to reach children is to screen them at schools. School is also a good place for education of children about hyperlipidemia and risk factors.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that family history of hyperlipidemia is not a reliable indicator for cholesterol screening in school children, as no significant relations were found between family history and serum lipid levels."}
{"answers": "These data indicate digoxin use may be associated with a reduction in risk of PCa. Given the potential mechanisms by which digoxin may exert an anti-neoplastic effect and other recent studies showing a negative association between digoxin use and PCa, further research is warranted.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that use of digoxin for cardiovascular disease is associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer."}
{"answers": "GHD men receiving GH treatment have a mortality rate not different from the background population. In women, after exclusion of high-risk patients, mortality was not different from the background population except for CVD. Mortality due to malignancies was not elevated in adults receiving GH treatment. Next to gender, the heterogeneous etiology is of influence on mortality in GHD adults with GH treatment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, growth hormone replacement therapy (GHRT) reduces mortality in adults with growth hormone deficiency (GHD). The study found that patients in the treatment group had a lower standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for all-cause, malignancy, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality compared to the control groups. Specifically, 95 patients died in the treatment group compared to 74.6 expected deaths, resulting in an SMR of 1.27 (95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.56).

{"answers": "Expression of ER is a constitutional feature of the connective tissue and smooth muscle cells of the anal continence organ. Estrogen receptors and PR are not detectable in the striated muscle fibers of the external anal sphincter in either sex. The presence of ER in the stroma and smooth muscles of the anal canal suggests that these tissues are targets for estrogen. This constitutes a theoretical basis for the beneficial effects of estrogen and progestin replacement on anal continence in postmenopausal women.", "prediction_text": "The presence of estrogen and progesterone receptors in the tissues of the anal canal suggests that hormonal influences may play a role in anal continence in women, but the results do not provide conclusive evidence for a direct correlation between hormone receptors and anal incontinence."}
{"answers": "In women with bothersome MUI, concomitant AA repair does not result in additional improvement in OAB symptoms over MUS alone. Patients with postoperative complications exhibit less improvement in OAB symptoms.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that concomitant anterior/apical repair during midurethral sling does not improve the overactive bladder component of mixed incontinence. The OAB-q SS change score was similar between the groups."}
{"answers": "An association was found between sublingual varices and hypertension. Examining the lateral borders of the tongue is easily done, causes no harm and could be a valuable method for the dental profession to take active part in preventive healthcare.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a connection between sublingual varices and hypertension. The study found an association between the presence of sublingual varices and hypertension, with a odds ratio of 2.25 and a p-value of <0.002. Additionally, the study found that patients with grade 1 sublingual varices had higher mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared to those with grade 0 varices."}
{"answers": "Our data suggested that visually impaired pedestrians can make accurate and reliable street crossing decisions like those of normally sighted pedestrians. When using auditory information only, all subjects significantly overestimated the vehicular gap time. Our finding that blind pedestrians performed significantly worse than either the normally sighted or visually impaired subjects under the hearing only condition suggested that they may benefit from training to improve their detection ability and/or interpretation of vehicular gap times.", "prediction_text": "Yes, normally sighted and visually impaired pedestrians are accurate and reliable in making street crossing decisions when using either visual or auditory information, but blind pedestrians are less accurate and reliable when relying solely on auditory information."}
{"answers": "Initial single scrotal incision can be recommended for orchidopexy, even in the more difficult cases of impalpable undescended testes. Advantages seem to include shorter operative time, a cosmetically appealing single incision, and possibly less pain. The scrotal incision technique significantly reduces the need for laparoscopy in impalpable testes. Surprisingly, it even allows successful orchidopexy of abdominal testes, provided an open processus is present.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the scrotal approach should be considered as the first choice for both palpable and impalpable undescended testes, based on the findings of this study."}
{"answers": "Center differences in enteral feeding advancement occur and may have a significant impact on short-term outcomes such as nosocomial sepsis. Large, multicenter, prospective trials are required to further elucidate the optimal feeding strategy for VLBW infants.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the enteral feeding advancement affects short-term outcomes in very low birth weight infants. VLBW infants born in centers with slow advancement (SA) have a higher rate of sepsis, particularly late-onset sepsis, compared to those born in centers with rapid advancement (RA)."}

{"answers": "The EBP unit was associated with better patient outcomes and more efficient performance than achieved by the same physicians previously or by SP concurrently.", "prediction_text": "Yes, evidence-based practice (EBP) was found to improve patient outcomes in the study. Compared to standard practice (SP), EBP was associated with a lower risk of death (6.27% vs 7.75%, P < 0.001) and a shorter length of stay (6.01 vs 8.46 days, P < 0.001) in patients treated by EBP doctors."}
{"answers": "Although travel burden is associated with timely diagnosis and treatment for some types of cancer, we did not find evidence that driving time was, in general, better at predicting timeliness of cancer diagnosis and treatment than driving distance. More intensive efforts at early detection of breast cancer and early treatment of CRC for Medicaid patients who live in remote areas may be needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, distance to provider is a barrier to care for Medicaid patients with breast, colorectal, or lung cancer. Specifically, the study found that patients who had to travel longer distances to their primary care provider were more likely to be diagnosed at a later stage and experience longer delays in treatment compared to those who had shorter travel times."}
{"answers": "Our results indicate that training managers in transformational leadership behaviours may have a positive impact on healthcare workers' health over time. However, more research is needed to examine the mechanisms by which transformational leadership brings about improved sleep quality; self-efficacy was not found to be the explanation.", "prediction_text": "No, self-efficacy does not mediate the relationship between transformational leadership behaviors and healthcare workers' sleep quality."}
{"answers": "The use of US helps in making a correct diagnosis and in the follow-up with objective criteria and also convinces the patient and the family that the treatment needs to be continued.", "prediction_text": "Yes, ultrasound can be a useful tool for diagnosing and following up on constipation in children. The study found that ultrasound measurements of rectal diameter and anterior wall thickness were higher in constipated children compared to non-constipated children, and that the cutoff point for diagnosis was a rectal diameter of 2.44 cm. Additionally, the study showed that ultrasound can be used to monitor the response to treatment and assess the normalization of rectal diameter after treatment."}
{"answers": "Brachytherapy with ruthenium applicators is an effective therapy for small- and medium-size posterior uveal melanomas. Our results are comparable to other series. The treatment outcome does not seem to be capable of improvement by increasing the apical dose. An internationally accepted model for defining the dosage in brachytherapy is needed.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that escalating the apical dose to 160 Gy does not significantly improve treatment outcomes for posterior uveal melanomas treated with 106Ru plaque beta-ray radiotherapy."}
{"answers": "The addition of epinephrine to ACLS-SAPO increases vital organ perfusion pressures and improves outcome from cardiac arrest. There appears to be a profound loss of arterial vasomotor tone after prolonged arrest. This loss of vasomotor tone may make exogenous pressors necessary for resuscitation after prolonged cardiac arrest.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that a pressor (in this case, epinephrine) may be necessary during aortic perfusion and oxygenation therapy (SAPO) for cardiac arrest. The study found that the use of epinephrine during SAPO resulted in higher aortic pressures and a greater increase in coronary perfusion pressure compared to the use of saline placebo. This suggests that epinephrine may help to improve the efficacy of SAPO by increasing coronary perfusion and potentially improving the chances of return of spontaneous circulation."}
{"answers": "In a leading specialty journal, cited reviewers gave higher scores than noncited reviewers. However, this\u00a0was likely due to their being assigned higher-quality manuscripts and not because they were cited in the manuscript. Reviewer requests that their work be cited were rare.", "prediction_text": "Yes, reviewers' scores are influenced by citations to their own work. The study found that manuscripts that contained citations to the reviewer's work received higher evaluations than those that did not, and reviewers were more likely to suggest adding citations to their own work or other work in their reviews."}
{"answers": "Preoperative education delivered by nurses reduced anxiety and postoperative complications of patients undergoing cardiac surgery, but it was not effective in reducing readmissions or length of stay.", "prediction_text": "Yes, nurse-led preoperative education can reduce anxiety and postoperative complications of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The study found that patients who received preoperative education had lower levels of state anxiety on the day before surgery and during the follow-up period, and a lower incidence of chest infections compared to the control group."}
{"answers": "Improving hospital efficiency by shortening length of stay does not appear to result in increased rates of readmission or numbers of physician visits within 30 days after discharge from hospital. Research is needed to identify optimal lengths of stay and expected readmission rates.", "prediction_text": "The study found no evidence to suggest that decreasing lengths of stay in Winnipeg hospitals for selected diagnostic categories adversely affected the quality of care."}
{"answers": "Solitary kidney in a canine model is more resistant to ischemia than paired kidneys based on radiological, pathological and genetic evidence.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that a solitary kidney is more susceptible to warm ischemia-induced damage compared to a paired kidney, with a faster and more severe decline in kidney function in the solitary kidney group."}

We conclude that further, comparative, more comprehensive, long-term, and controlled studies are required.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, 3-phase bone scintigraphy is a useful method for determining amputation levels in diabetic foot, but it is not a guideline method."}
{"answers": "At baseline assessment patients of lower socioeconomic status showed lower health related quality of life. Since there was no clear trend at follow-up assessment this suggests that patients from different socioeconomic status responded to treatment similarly. In general, the findings suggest that quality of life is not only the outcome of the disease and its treatment, but is also highly dependent on each patients' socioeconomic characteristics.", "prediction_text": "Yes, socioeconomic status (SES) matters in quality of life (QoL) in lung cancer patients. Lower SES patients had more health problems, less functioning, and more symptoms at baseline compared to higher SES patients. However, there was no significant difference between patient groups at follow-up."}
{"answers": "General surgery research residents' intraoperative leadership skills showed significant correlations to their perceptions of skill decay and task difficulty during a bowel repair. Evaluating resident's directional instructions may provide an additional individualized intraoperative assessment metric.

{"answers": "A well developed collateral circulation does not predict an increased risk of restenosis after PCI.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that a well-developed collateral circulation does not predispose to restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In fact, the study found that patients with good collaterals had more severe coronary stenoses at baseline, but the restenosis rates were similar in both groups."}
{"answers": "We conclude that patient and graft survival on transplanting kidneys from elderly donors to young recipients is superimposable on that obtained with young donors. However, renal function is better in the group of young donors.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that it is appropriate to implant kidneys from elderly donors in young recipients, as there were no significant differences in survival rates or graft function between the two groups at 1, 5, and 10 years post-transplant."}
{"answers": "Many patients do not understand their ED care or their discharge instructions. Moreover, most patients appear to be unaware of their lack of understanding and report inappropriate confidence in their comprehension and recall.", "prediction_text": "No, patients are not always aware of when they do not understand their emergency department (ED) care and instructions. According to the study, only 20% of patients reported difficulty with comprehension when they actually had deficient comprehension in at least one domain."}
{"answers": "The results of this study suggest that normothermic CPB does not prevent the development of the \"euthyroid sick syndrome\" during and after CPB. Despite these changes in thyroid function, most patients in both groups had a normal postoperative recovery.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the temperature during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) does not have a significant effect on the development of postoperative euthyroid sick syndrome (ESS)."}
{"answers": "Severe hypoglycaemia is associated with an increased risk for CV outcomes in people at high CV risk and dysglycaemia. Although allocation to insulin glargine vs. standard care was associated with an increased risk of severe and non-severe hypoglycaemia, the relative risk of CV outcomes with hypoglycaemia was lower with insulin glargine-based glucose-lowering therapy than with the standard glycaemic control. Trial Registration (ORIGIN ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00069784).", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that severe hypoglycaemia is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, including the composite of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke, mortality, CV mortality, and arrhythmic death."}
