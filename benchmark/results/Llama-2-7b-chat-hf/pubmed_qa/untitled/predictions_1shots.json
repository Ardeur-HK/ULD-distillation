{"answers": "These data suggest that being willing and fit enough for a chemotherapy protocol is a good prognostic factor for invasive bladder cancer. This eligibility bias emphasizes the need for prospective, randomized trials, and indicates that single-group studies using historical or matched controls have to be interpreted with caution.", "prediction_text": "Yes, eligibility for an adjuvant chemotherapy protocol after radical cystectomy is a good prognostic factor for invasive bladder cancer. The study found that patients who were eligible for the chemotherapy protocol had better overall survival, recurrence-free survival, and a lower rate of cancer-related death compared to those who were not eligible."}
{"answers": "An additional delayed phase through the abdomen in routine contrast-enhanced CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis is of low yield, particularly if reliable follow-up imaging to further elucidate uncertain findings is available.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that delayed imaging in routine CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis may not be worth the additional cost of radiation and time for most patients. While delayed imaging may reveal incidental findings that could be confirmed at non-invasive follow-up imaging, the majority of patients (95.8%) did not benefit from the additional phase. In fact, the use of the delayed phase resulted in a significant increase in effective radiation dose (mean 59.5%)."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that the SCL 90-R is best viewed as an indicator of unidimensional emotional distress and somatic effects of structural brain injury.", "prediction_text": "The Symptom Checklist 90-R Obsessive-Compulsive subscale does not identify objective cognitive impairments, but it is related to symptoms of depression, anxiety, and subjective complaints of memory problems in individuals with brain tumors."}
{"answers": "The results suggest that NA treatment can be stopped in selected patients with CHB as long as they are not cirrhotic, have completed a minimum period of treatment, have normal ALT and sustained undetectable DNA. These patients should be closely monitored during the first year and then indefinitely.", "prediction_text": "Yes, it is possible to stop treatment with nucleos(t)ide analogs (NAs) in patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B (CHB), but the rate of virological relapse is high, with 54.54% of patients experiencing a relapse within 6.38 months (\u00b1 1.9) after discontinuation."}
{"answers": "The results of this study do not support the hypothesis that there is a direct link between atmospheric pressure values and abdominal aortic aneurysm ruptures.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the diameter of the aneurysm is important in determining the influence of atmospheric pressure on aortic aneurysm rupture. The study found that larger aneurysms (>7 cm) were associated with a higher risk of rupture, and this risk was statistically significant in patients with hypertension."}
{"answers": "Findings from these studies support discordance between device-recorded and self-reported hot flashes. In addition, the studies reveal further limitations of SSC monitoring, including difficulties with data collection and lack of consistency in interpretation. Based on these results and other recent trials identifying issues with SSC methodology, it is time to find a better physiologic surrogate measure for hot flashes.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that sternal skin conductance (SSC) may not be a reliable or accurate measure of hot flashes, as the first prototype of the SSC device was unable to collect usable data due to technical issues, and the second prototype had a concordance rate of only 24% between self-reported and device-recorded hot flashes. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that SSC is a reasonable surrogate for hot flash measurement."}
{"answers": ": Prophylactic fixation with a cephalomedullary nail was not found to be cost-effective for the average older woman who sustained a hip fracture. However, it may be appropriate for select patient populations. The study supports the need for basic science and clinical trials investigating the effectiveness of prophylactic fixation for patient populations at higher lifetime risk for contralateral hip fracture.", "prediction_text": "Prophylactic fixation of the uninjured hip is not cost-effective for a 79-year-old woman in the baseline analysis, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $142,795 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. However, prophylactic fixation may be a cost-effective method to prevent contralateral hip fracture in certain subgroups, such as women aged 71-75 years with a 30% greater relative risk for a contralateral fracture, and women younger than age 70 years. The cost-effectiveness of prophylactic fix"}
{"answers": "We found that USMLE Step 2, number of honors in medical school clerkships, and AOA membership demonstrated the strongest correlations with resident performance. Our goal in analyzing these data was to provide residency programs at large a sense of which criteria may be \"high yield\" in ranking applicants by analyzing data from within our own pool of residents. Similar studies across a broader scope of programs are warranted to confirm applicability of our findings. The continually emerging complexities of the field of orthopaedic surgery lend increasing importance to future work on the appropriate selection and training of orthopaedic residents.", "prediction_text": "Yes, preresidency selection criteria can predict performance in orthopaedic surgery residency. Specifically, the study found that:"}
{"answers": "In vitro fertilization outcome is strongly correlated with both maternal ages, basal cycle, day 3 follicle, stimulated hormone, and antral follicle assessment. Antral follicle assessment was a better predictor of in vitro fertilization outcome than were age or follicle stimulated hormone. Antral follicle assessment may provide a marker for ovarian age that is distinct from chronological age or hormonal markers.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that baseline antral follicle assessment may be a better predictor of in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcome than age and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels. The clinical pregnancy rate was significantly higher in the group with baseline antral follicle >6 compared to those with antral follicle <or = 6, even after controlling for patient age and basal FSH levels. Additionally, the cancellation rate was significantly higher in the group with baseline antral follicle <or = 6 compared to those with antral follicle >or = 6. These"}
{"answers": "Neither insertion of PEG tubes nor timing of insertion affect survival.", "prediction_text": "No, feeding tube insertion and its timing do not improve survival in advanced cognitive impairment patients in nursing homes."}
{"answers": "In this well established early discharge program with nurse home visits, newborn metabolic screening is not compromised by early discharge.", "prediction_text": "Yes, early discharge with nurse home visits affects the adequacy of newborn metabolic screening. Compared to traditional stay infants, early discharge infants had a higher rate of initial filter paper specimens being inadequate, but a higher rate of repeat specimens when the initial specimen was inadequate. Additionally, early discharge infants were more likely to have an adequate specimen within the first 9 days of life."}
{"answers": "The palliative treatment concept of 25\u00a0Gy applied in 5\u00a0fractions is sufficient for radiation of lung cancer, given that there was no obvious survival improvement in patients treated with the higher total dose regimen.", "prediction_text": "No, high-dose radiotherapy (50 Gy in 20 fractions) does not appear to benefit palliative lung cancer patients compared to lower-dose radiotherapy (25 Gy in 5 fractions), in terms of overall survival."}
{"answers": "Although elevated leukocyte count and CRP value cannot effectively establish the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the elderly, unelevated values exclude it. Accordingly, appendectomy is not recommended to be performed in an elderly patient with unelevated leukocyte count and CRP value, although clinical symptoms and signs indicate acute appendicitis.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a role for leukocyte and CRP measurements in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the elderly. According to the study, there were no statistically significant differences in leukocyte counts or CRP values between patients with an uninflamed appendix and those with acute appendicitis. However, the study found that group B (acute appendicitis) contained no patients with both leukocyte count and CRP values unelevated, suggesting that both markers may be useful in diagnosing acute appendicitis in the elderly."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrates that in patients at risk for cardiac morbidity undergoing vascular surgery, desflurane is effective to control intraoperative hypertension without fear of major cardiac depressant effect.", "prediction_text": "Yes, desflurane can alter left ventricular function when used to control surgical stimulation during aortic surgery. The study found that the addition of desflurane to control hypertension during surgery resulted in an increase in systemic vascular resistance, end-systolic wall stress, and left ventricular stroke work index, indicating an increase in left ventricular afterload. However, there were no changes in heart rate, cardiac index, mean pulmonary arterial pressure, stroke volume, end-diastolic and end-systolic cross-sectional areas, fractional area change, or left ventricular circumferential fiber shortening"}
{"answers": "Development of tolerance to gluten seems possible in some patients with CD. Further follow-up will show whether this tolerance is permanent or only a long-term return to latency. This feature may be associated with genetic characteristics, especially with HLA genotypes that differ from DQ2 or DQ8. More insight into the mechanisms of the development of gluten tolerance may help to distinguish those CD patients that might not require life-long GFD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, some adult patients with celiac disease (CD) may develop tolerance to gluten after 20 years of diagnosis, although the prevalence is low. In this study, 23% of patients had a gluten-containing diet, and 62% followed the gluten-free diet (GFD). Among those on the GFD, 4% had normal small bowel mucosa, indicating tolerance to gluten. One of the patients who developed tolerance was HLA-DQ2/DQ8 negative, suggesting that other factors may also play a role in the development of tolerance."}
{"answers": "No home-prepared replacement milks in South Africa meet all estimated micronutrient and essential fatty acid requirements of infants aged<6 months. Commercial infant formula is the only replacement milk that meets all nutritional needs. Revisions of WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF HIV and infant feeding course replacement milk options are needed. If replacement milks are to provide total nutrition, preparations should include vegetable oils, such as soybean oil, as a source of linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids, and additional vitamins and minerals.", "prediction_text": "No, the WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF-recommended replacement milks for infants of HIV-infected mothers are not appropriate in the South African context. The study found that the replacement milks provided inadequate amounts of micronutrients, including vitamins E and C, folic acid, iodine, and selenium, and did not meet the minimum recommended levels of linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid. Additionally, the preparation times and costs of the home-prepared replacement milks were found to be more feasible and affordable than the commercial formula."}
{"answers": "We have shown that eosinophilic inflammation of the airway wall may increase PD and that the association of eosinophil counts with ICSs may result in lessening the PD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) affect the perception of dyspnea during bronchoconstriction in asthma patients. The study found that ICS-treated patients had lower VAS scores for dyspnea during a methacholine-induced FEV1 decrease compared to ICS-naive patients. Additionally, eosinophil counts and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) were found to be negatively associated with PD in ICS-treated patients, while eosinophil counts were positively associated with PD in ICS-naive patients."}
{"answers": "High socioeconomic status was associated with a higher acceptance rate of preventive home visits, but the association was attenuated by invitational procedures. The results indicate that the social inequality in acceptance of publicly offered preventive services might decrease if municipalities adopt more proactive invitational procedures.", "prediction_text": "Yes, acceptance rates of a national preventive home visit program for older people are socially imbalanced, with older people with high financial assets more likely to accept the program than those with low financial assets, and the association is attenuated when adjusted by the invitational procedures used by the municipalities."}
{"answers": "In the present study, FT and androstenedione were statistically significantly correlated with sexual desire in the total cohort of women. ADT-G did not correlate more strongly than circulating androgens with sexual desire and is therefore not superior to measuring circulating androgens by mass spectrometry.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a correlation between androgens and sexual desire in women. The study found that sexual desire correlated with circulating androgens, such as total testosterone (TT), calculated free testosterone (FT), androstenedione, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), in both the total cohort of women and in a subgroup of women aged 25-44 years who did not use systemic hormonal contraception. Additionally, in women aged 45-65 years, androstenedione correlated with sexual desire. However, no correlation was found between the primary androgen metabolite androsterone gluc"}
{"answers": "The results of these analyses suggest that marginally higher rates of depression to age 35 amongst the comorbid MD/AUD group were explained by increased exposure to adverse childhood circumstances amongst members of the comorbid group. Adolescent MD/AUD comorbidity is likely to be a risk marker, rather than a causal factor in subsequent MD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, comorbidity of major depression (MD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD) in adolescence is associated with poorer outcomes of MD in adulthood, after adjusting for confounding factors such as gender, childhood behavior problems, and exposure to physical and sexual abuse."}
{"answers": "There are no statistically apparent motion differences between SUP-CTV and INF-CTV. Current uniform planning target volume (PTV) margins are adequate to cover both portions of the CTV.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no statistically significant difference in target motion between the superior and inferior portions of the clinical target volume (PB-CTV) in the study population."}
{"answers": "Combined end points for adverse events are acceptable in the octogenarian. Carotid endarterectomy remains the gold standard for treatment of extracranial carotid disease in all age groups. Age alone should not place patients in the high-risk category for carotid endarterectomy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, octogenarians (patients aged 80-89 years) are considered high-risk for carotid endarterectomy due to the increased risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality, including neurologic events and myocardial infarction."}
{"answers": "Lysosomotropic amines in combination with cyclosporine appear to be synergistic in the suppression of T-cell proliferation to MiHC and MHC. Use of chloroquine in combination with cyclosporine may result in improved control of GVHD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, synergy exists between lysosomotropic amines and cyclosporine in immunosuppression on T-cell responses to minor and major histocompatibility antigens."}
{"answers": "The results of this study suggest that the cardiovascular response to exercise training may be different in men and women. Women may benefit more from interventions aimed to increase physical activity as a tool for prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.", "prediction_text": "Yes, exercise training has a significant effect on heart rate and QT interval in healthy young individuals, with trained individuals showing lower heart rates and higher heart rate variability compared to sedentary subjects. Additionally, there are gender differences in the effects of exercise training on the QT/RR slope, with a more pronounced effect in women."}
{"answers": "Although BD is correlated with GCS at presentation and RTS, it is not a reliable prognostic marker for outcome and mortality in patients with isolated TBI.", "prediction_text": "No, base deficit does not predict mortality in patients with severe traumatic brain injury."}
{"answers": "\"Aquagenic maladies\" could be a pediatric form of the aquagenic urticaria.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that syncope during bathing in infants can be a pediatric form of water-induced urticaria, similar to aquagenic urticaria. The study found a correlation between the infants' symptoms and the presence of dermographism in their families, as well as an increase in blood histamine levels after a trial bath in two of the infants. The evolution of the \"aquagenic maladies\" was favourable after avoiding baths for a few weeks, but three out of seven infants continued to experience troubles associated with sun or water after a 2-7 year follow-up."}
{"answers": "Laparoscopic procedures caused detectable damage to Kupffer and endothelial cells as reflected by elevation of post-operative HA serum levels. The damage to the liver hepatocytes and perisinusoidal cells has no clinical significance and the laparoscopic procedure itself is the probable cause of the Kupffer and endothelial cells damage, while other mechanisms caused damage to the hepatocytes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, laparoscopic cholecystectomy appears to influence peri-sinusoidal cell activity, as evidenced by the significant increase in serum hyaluronic acid (HA) levels in patients who underwent the procedure, while beta-N-acetyl hexosaminidase (beta-NAH) levels remained within normal values."}
{"answers": "Sleep disorders are common in the general adult population of Japan. Correction for reporting heterogeneity using anchoring vignettes is not a necessary tool for proper management of sleep and energy related problems among Japanese adults. Older age, gender differences in communicating sleep-related problems, the presence of multiple morbidities, and regular exercise should be the focus of policies and clinical practice to improve sleep and energy management in Japan.", "prediction_text": "Yes, adjustment for reporting heterogeneity is necessary in sleep disorders. The study found that after adjusting for reporting heterogeneity, age, the number of comorbidities, and regular exercise were significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems, while sex was no longer a significant factor. This suggests that accounting for differences in response category cut-points can lead to more accurate estimates of the relationship between sleep disorders and various factors."}
{"answers": "Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is often challenging in men on account of more adhesions and inflammation. This leads to higher conversion rates and more postoperative complications. Optimized planning and a more experienced operating surgeon may help overcome these problems.", "prediction_text": "Yes, sex affects the outcome of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Male patients have a higher conversion rate to open cholecystectomy and a higher incidence of biliary injuries compared to female patients."}
{"answers": "To uphold the notion for radiation exposure to be as low as reasonably achievable, ureteroscopic stone retrieval can safely be done without the use of fluoroscopy in a significant number of patients.", "prediction_text": "No, fluoroscopy is not essential for the retrieval of lower ureteric stones in all cases. According to the study, complete clearance without the use of fluoroscopy was achieved in 94.2% of patients."}
{"answers": "Surrogates of injury severity, including days in the ICU and non-ICU hospital LOS>10 days, were associated with the development of HO in our cohort of acetabular fracture patients. Prophylaxis with XRT was significantly protective against the development of HO, and the ability to provide prophylaxis is very likely related to the severity of injury.", "prediction_text": "Yes, surrogates of injury severity, such as length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU, and the use of external radiation beam therapy (XRT), are significantly associated with the development and severity of heterotopic ossification (HO) in patients with acetabular fractures treated with a posterior approach."}
{"answers": "In this series of 35 patients, the use of epidural analgesia for HIPEC does not seem to be associated with a worse risk of haemodynamic instability, spinal haematoma, meningitis or epidural abscess. HIPEC with platinum salt is not incompatible with the safety of epidural analgesia, with an optimized fluid management peroperatively and the following of perimedullary anesthesia practice guidelines.", "prediction_text": "No, epidural analgesia for surgical treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis is not a risky technique. The study found no instances of spinal haematoma, meningitis, or epidural abscess in the 35 patients treated with HIPEC and epidural analgesia. Additionally, there were no significant changes in blood coagulation or leukocyte counts in the patients who received epidural analgesia."}
{"answers": "The Diabeo system improved glycaemic control in both high and low users who avidly used the IDA function, while the greatest improvement was seen in the low users who had the motivational support of teleconsultations.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that technology alone may not be sufficient to improve glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes. While high users of the smartphone-based insulin dose advisor (IDA) and teleconsultation function showed a stable level of informed meals and HbA1c levels from baseline to the end of the study, low users showed a significant improvement in HbA1c levels with the addition of teleconsultation support. However, the difference in improvement between high and low users was not statistically significant, suggesting that other factors beyond technology may play a role in improving glycemic control."}
{"answers": "Despite a lower risk of breast cancer, the Sami attended the NBCSP more frequently than the control group. The recall and cancer detection rate was lower among the Sami compared with the non-Sami group.", "prediction_text": "Yes, early outcome measures of mammographic screening in Sami-speaking municipalities and a control group are influenced by ethnicity. The attendance rate in the Norwegian Breast Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP) was higher in the Sami population (78%) compared to the control group (75%), and the recall rates were also lower in the Sami population (2.4% vs 3.3%). However, the rate of invasive screen-detected cancer was not significantly lower in the Sami group. Additionally, the percentage of all breast cancers detected in the NBCSP among the Sami population (67%) was lower compared to the non-Sami population ("}
{"answers": "GP ablation did not prove to be beneficial for postoperative stable NSR. A complete left atrial lesion set and biatrial ablation are advisable for improving rhythm outcomes. Randomized controlled trials are necessary to confirm our findings.", "prediction_text": "No, ganglionated plexi ablation during the Maze IV procedure is not beneficial for postoperative long-term stable sinus rhythm."}
{"answers": "It is concluded that serum pancreatic lipase is a more accurate biomarker of acute pancreatitis than serum amylase.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, serum pancreatic lipase may be a more accurate biomarker than serum amylase for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. The study found that serum pancreatic lipase had a higher area under the curve (AUC) in the receiver operator characteristic analysis compared to serum amylase, indicating better diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, a clinically useful cut-off point for serum pancreatic lipase was found to be at 208 U/L, with a sensitivity of 90.3% and specificity of 93%. In contrast, the cut-off point for serum amylase was 114"}

{"answers": "Brachial systolic blood pressure difference is related to the severity of SSS and can be used as a screening tool for SSS. However, it performed better in severe steal than milder steal phenomena.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the blood pressure difference between arms can predict the severity of subclavian steal syndrome (SSS). In this study, patients with complete reversal or alternating flow in the vertebral artery waveform had higher blood pressure differences between arms compared to those with systolic deceleration. This suggests that the degree of blood pressure difference between arms may be a useful indicator of the severity of SSS."}
{"answers": "a-tDCS could be useful in identifying residual connectivity markers in clinically-defined UWS, who may lack of purposeful behavior as a result of a motor-output failure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can be useful in differentiating unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) from minimally conscious state (MCS) patients. The study found that a-tDCS can boost cortical connectivity and excitability in all healthy individuals, MCS patients, and unmask excitability/connectivity in some UWS patients."}
{"answers": "Most people in France are influenced by situational factors when deciding if a physician should breach confidentiality to protect the spouse of a patient infected with STD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that French lay people and health professionals generally find it acceptable to breach confidentiality to protect a patient's wife from a sexually transmitted disease. Lay people and psychologists were more likely to accept breaching confidentiality in this situation than physicians, and the patient's intentions to protect their wife and inform them of the disease had the greatest impact on acceptability."}
{"answers": "Most students do not encounter all 10 conditions during patient encounters throughout a 4-week EM rotation, although most have exposure to at least eight. Certain conditions are far less likely than others to be encountered, and may need to be taught in a nonclinical setting.", "prediction_text": "Yes, medical students in the study met the national standards for clinical encounters of selected core conditions in emergency medicine. According to the study, 15.4% of students saw all 10 conditions during their rotation, and 76.9% saw at least eight conditions. The average number of conditions seen per student was 8.4, ranging from 7-8.6."}
{"answers": "The findings indicate that the clinical significance of symptomatic BDS is similar to that of CBD stones. Bile duct sludge seems to be an early stage of choledocholithiasis.", "prediction_text": "Bile duct sludge (BDS) is different from bile duct stones (CBD stones) in terms of frequency, associated risk factors, and clinical outcome after endoscopic therapy. BDS is more common in females and is less likely to be associated with common bile duct dilation compared to CBD stones. However, the clinical significance of BDS is poorly defined, and it is not a reliable indicator of recurrent CBD stones."}
{"answers": "Routine placement of nasogastric tube in patients operated of LSG seems not useful in reducing leaks' incidence.", "prediction_text": "Yes, nasogastric decompression is useful in preventing staple line leaks after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. The study found that the incidence of staple line leaks was significantly lower in the group that underwent nasogastric decompression during the procedure (0% vs 1.4% in the control group)."}
{"answers": "The results obtained in this study demonstrate that LUS is an accurate and highly sensitive procedure in staging colorectal cancer, providing a useful and reliable diagnostic tool complementary to laparoscopy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, laparoscopic sonography (LUS) is a reliable and sensitive procedure for staging colorectal cancer, particularly for evaluating hepatic metastases, with a sensitivity of 100% compared to preoperative diagnostic means and laparoscopy. However, it has a low specificity (53%) for nodal metastases."}
{"answers": "Most community providers believe IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion; this belief is associated with increased resource use. Experts comply more closely with guidelines to diagnose IBS with minimal testing. This disconnect suggests that better implementation of guidelines is warranted to minimize variation and improve cost-effectiveness of care.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that IBS is not considered a diagnosis of exclusion by most providers, including experts. In fact, the majority of providers (80%) believe that IBS should be diagnosed positively using the Rome criteria alone, rather than as a diagnosis of exclusion."}
{"answers": "Correlation between level of radiographic transition zone on contrast enema and length of aganglionosis remains low. Systematic preoperative biopsy by coelioscopy or ombilical incision is mandatory.", "prediction_text": "The correlation between the radiographic transition zone on contrast enema and the level of aganglionosis on the specimen in Hirschsprung's disease is moderate, with an agreement of 58.1% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.39."}

The study found that only a small percentage of patients with low-tone SD developed vertigo and Meniere's disease, and there was no significant difference in the rate of progression from SD to Meniere's disease between the low-tone and high-tone SD groups."}
{"answers": "It is concluded that ACE-DD genotype may be a risk factor for the causation and development of chronic kidney failure among hypertensive patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that ACE-1 gene polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) among hypertensive patients. The DD genotype of the ACE-1 gene was found to be significantly associated with higher levels of blood urea and serum creatinine, and the risk of CKD was also increased among hypertensive patients with the D allele of the ACE gene."}
{"answers": "Older people with a history of amblyopia who develop visual loss in the previously normal eye can experience recovery of visual function in the amblyopic eye over a period of time. This recovery in visual function occurs in the wake of visual loss in the fellow eye and the improvement appears to be sustained.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that visual loss due to amblyopia is not permanent. The mean improvement in distance and near acuity in amblyopic eyes was observed to be 3.3 and 1.9 lines logMAR respectively, indicating a significant improvement in visual acuity over a period of 12 months."}
{"answers": "These results suggest that quantitative real-time PCR assays for BCRABL detection can be comparable between laboratories despite significant differences in methodologies if the same positive control cell line and quality control gene are used. It is imperative that some level of assay standardization be adopted between laboratories, not only for patients who are monitored at different facilities, but also for larger investigative studies in which hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular responses are to be compared.", "prediction_text": "Yes, correlated results are possible between homebrew assays for BCRABL transcript detection by quantitative real-time PCR. The study found a strong correlation (r(s) = 0.9435, p < 0.00001) between the results of 22 paired BCRABL-positive samples analyzed at different laboratories using different methods, indicating that the results are comparable and can be correlated."}
{"answers": "Although the exact mechanism of SSDH in this case is unclear, we speculate that this SSDH was a hematoma that migrated from the intracranial subdural space. Low CSF pressure because of continuous drainage and intrathecal thrombolytic therapy may have played an important role in the migration of the hematoma through the spinal canal. It is important to recognize the SSDH as a possible complication of the SAH accompanied with intracranial subdural hematoma.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the case report suggests that spinal subdural hematoma can be a sequela of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm, specifically a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)."}
{"answers": "LAA occlusion device resulted in a slightly movement in QRS axis, reduced HR and increased the mean-mean QT interval duration. In addition, LA diameter and ARD seemed to be larger after device implantation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, LAA occlusion device alters echocardiography and electrocardiogram parameters in patients with atrial fibrillation. A slight and measureable movement of QRS electric axis was observed after LAA occlusion, and significant differences were observed in heart rate (HR) and the mean-mean QT interval between pre- and post-operation for all patients. However, there were no significant differences in echocardiographic parameters between before and after device implantation. However, larger LA and ARD diameters were detected by echocardiography during follow-up visits at 6 and 12 months, respectively, compared to pre-operation parameters."}
{"answers": "The study results suggested that spinal cord untethering may be unnecessary in patients with MM who are undergoing scoliosis corrective surgery and do not present with clinical symptoms of a tethered cord, even though tethering is radiographically demonstrated.", "prediction_text": "No, untethering is not necessary prior to scoliosis correction in patients with myelomeningocele, based on the study's findings. The study found that none of the patients experienced neurological complications or shunt malfunction after undergoing scoliosis correction without first untethering the spinal cord."}
{"answers": "Under the conditions of this study, pulpotomy offered a viable alternative to root canal treatment for teeth with vital pulps in the short term. However, there is insufficient clinical evidence to consider this technique for the treatment of every permanent tooth. Nevertheless, it should be considered as a potential alternative approach to be further developed for future applications.", "prediction_text": "No, pulp chamber pulpotomy should not be seen as a permanent treatment. According to the study, 2 of the 17 treated teeth required root canal treatment for pain control and 1 for prosthetic reasons, indicating that the treatment may not be permanent."}
{"answers": "The site of access in our study does not appear to influence complications specifically neural injury or recurrence rates.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the site of endovenous access (above or below the mid-calf level) does not significantly influence early outcomes in the treatment of small saphenous varicose veins using endovenous laser ablation."}
{"answers": "Retinal haemorrhages following a convulsive episode are rare. Such a finding should trigger an extensive search for other reasons, including child abuse.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a retinal haemorrhage found after a convulsive episode should prompt further investigation to rule out systemic disorder or child abuse."}
{"answers": "Clear and distinct differences between the two studied groups were found indicating the root of this increased confidence may have developed due to exposure to the Pathway program.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the Global Longitudinal Pathway (GLP) medical education curriculum has influenced medical students' skills and attitudes toward culturally diverse populations."}
{"answers": "In normal daily practice, only a small number of clinically important adenomas are missed. The problem of missed adenomas probably is being exaggerated.", "prediction_text": "Based on the study, it appears that only a small percentage of colorectal cancers (1.3%) may have been missed during previous endoscopies due to adenomas."}
{"answers": "Emotional prosody, therefore, seems to be partially processed outside the focus of spatial attention. Whereas at early sensory processing stages spatial attention modulates the degree of emotional voice processing as a function of emotional valence, emotional prosody is processed outside of the focus of spatial attention at later processing stages.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the processing of affective prosody is influenced by spatial attention."}
{"answers": "Pancreas retransplantation is a safe procedure with acceptable graft survival that should be proposed to diabetic patients who have lost their primary graft.", "prediction_text": "Yes, pancreas retransplantation can be a successful second chance for diabetic patients who have lost their primary graft. The study found that second pancreas survival was close to primary graft survival and significantly better than first pancreas survival, regardless of the cause of first pancreas loss. Additionally, survival of second simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplantations was better than survival of second pancreas after kidney. Patient survival was excellent, with an 89% survival rate at 5 years. The study suggests that pancreas retransplantation can be a viable option for diabetic patients who have lost their primary graft."}
{"answers": "Weekend hospitalization leads to delayed provision of intensive procedures and elevated 1-year mortality for elderly AMI patients. The existence of measurable differences in treatments raises questions regarding the efficacy of a single input regulation (e.g., mandated nurse staffing ratios) in enhancing the quality of weekend care. My results suggest that targeted financial incentives might be a more cost-effective policy response than broad regulation aimed at improving quality.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study finds that hospitals provide lower quality care on weekends. Weekend-admitted patients are less likely to receive immediate intensive cardiac procedures, such as catheterization, angioplasty, and bypass surgery, and experience higher rates of adverse health outcomes, including higher mortality and readmission rates for congestive heart failure, compared to weekday-admitted patients."}
{"answers": "The presence of more than one virus in hospitalized children with ARI is very frequent but it does not seem to have a major clinical impact in terms of severity. However bacterial superinfection increases the severity of the disease course. On the contrary, pneumococcal vaccination plays a protective role.", "prediction_text": "No, the presence of viral co-infection does not significantly influence the severity of acute respiratory infection in children. However, bacterial superinfection is associated with increased severity, and pneumococcal vaccination is found to be a protective factor in terms of respiratory distress, PICU admission, clinical score, respiratory support requirement, and oxygen necessity."}
{"answers": "In our study, it was observed that although longer ETA was associated with longer hospitalization, ETA was not correlated with postoperative complications.

The study found that the adoption of standardized care practices, including bundles and checklists, led to a significant reduction in CLABSI rates, which were maintained at zero for over 370 days in 2012 and for over 600 days in the first quarter of 2013 after a brief increase in the CLABSI rate. Ongoing training, surveillance, and vigilance with catheter insertion and maintenance practices and improved documentation were identified as"}
{"answers": "Ketamine sedation was successful and well tolerated in all cases. The use of atropine as an adjunct for intramuscular ketamine sedation in children significantly reduces hypersalivation and may lower the incidence of post-procedural vomiting. Atropine is associated with a higher incidence of a transient rash. No serious adverse events were noted.", "prediction_text": "No, atropine is not needed with ketamine sedation in children, as it reduces the risk of hypersalivation and transient rash, and there is a trend towards better tolerance in the placebo group."}
{"answers": "Findings depict wandering and PNA as overlapping, but nonequivalent phenomena. Evidence supporting construct validity of wandering was more robust than that for PNA. Results have implications for accuracy in scientific and clinical detection and labeling of wandering and agitation.", "prediction_text": "No, wandering and physically nonaggressive agitation (PNA) are not equivalent. The study found that there are two distinct factors of PNA, which are not equivalent to wandering."}
{"answers": "An advance care planning model is feasible for community palliative care services.

{"answers": "The study allows us to determine that FB can move through the body but not towards the heart. The study also serves as a warning sign: in cases of prolonged histories of FB ingestion, imaging studies are mandatory before endoscopic examination.", "prediction_text": "Yes, foreign bodies (FB) can migrate through the body towards the heart, as described in the passage. The mechanisms involved in FB migration include the fixation of the FB in the mucosa, which can lead to its migration towards the heart through the blood vessels. The passage mentions the popular saying \"FB walk to the heart,\" which reflects the tendency of FB to migrate towards the heart. The authors analyzed four cases of extra-lumen migration of FB and found that they migrated from the esophagus to the aorta, neck area, pharynx, prevertebral fascia, and submandibular region. The passage discusses the risks posed by FB migration"}
{"answers": "Although most players in the study believe that rugby headgear may prevent concussion, only a minority reported wearing it.

While players tend to believe that headgear can prevent concussion, coaches are less convinced. Only a minority of players reported wearing headgear, and few felt that its use should be made mandatory."}
{"answers": "Early oral intake is possible after laparotomy and colorectal resection. Thus, the laparoscopic surgeon's claim of early tolerated oral intake may not be unique to laparoscopy.", "prediction_text": "No, early postoperative oral intake does not have to be limited to laparoscopy. The study found that patients who underwent laparotomy with either a colonic or ileal resection were able to resume regular food after resolution of ileus, regardless of the type of surgery they underwent."}
{"answers": "Both medial and lateral PTS were significantly steeper in failures of ACLR than the control group. Medial or lateral PTS \u22655\u00b0 was a new risk factor of ACLR failure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, failures of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) are associated with steep posterior tibial slopes (PTS). The study found that the medial and lateral PTSs were significantly steeper in the ACLR failure group compared to the control group, with a higher odds ratio of ACLR failure for medial PTS \u2265 5\u00b0 and lateral PTS \u2265 5\u00b0."}
{"answers": "These results suggest the need to provide interventions that are specifically designed to increase awareness of potential stroke signs and symptoms and appropriate subsequent clinical actions.", "prediction_text": "No, elderly patients do not correctly endorse the intention to call 911 when presented with clinical scenarios suggestive of acute stroke. Only 14% of the study participants correctly endorsed the intention to call 911, and only 65% reported that they would call an ambulance when presented with the most typical signs and symptoms of stroke."}
{"answers": "We conclude that routine CXR after bronchoscopy with TBB is necessary only in patients with symptoms suggestive of pneumothorax. In asymptomatic patients, pneumothorax is rare and usually small, so routine CXR is not necessary in this category of patients.", "prediction_text": "No, routine chest radiography after transbronchial biopsy is not necessary, as pneumothorax occurs in only 2.9% of cases and symptoms suggestive of pneumothorax are present in only 7% of cases."}
{"answers": "Early surfactant administration is associated with shorter duration of ventilation but does not appear to be significantly protective against CLD/mortality among premature infants. This may support the growing evidence for consideration of CPAP as an alternative to routine intubation and early surfactant administration. Further investigation from large randomized clinical trials is warranted to confirm these results.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the timing of initial surfactant treatment makes a difference in the rates of chronic lung disease (CLD) or mortality in premature infants. The study found that infants who received early surfactant (within one hour of birth) had lower rates of CLD and mortality compared to those who received late surfactant (after one hour of birth)."}

{"answers": "We concluded that depiction of the superior wall of the mandibular canal cannot be improved by changing the thickness of images.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mandibular depiction can be improved by changing the thickness of double-oblique computed tomography (CT) images. In this study, the highest value for mandibular depiction was obtained with 0.9 mm-thick images in the alveolar crest and the whole of the mandibular canal."}
{"answers": "Exclusive CRT approach is not safe to treat patients with low infiltrative rectal carcinoma.", "prediction_text": "Chemoradiation therapy (CRT) may not be safe as a primary treatment for mid and low rectal tumors, as local recurrence occurred in 8 out of 10 patients with complete response (CR) within 3.7 to 8.8 months after treatment."}
{"answers": "Random survival forests did not yield higher performance compared to Cox proportional hazards. We found improvement in prediction performance when coupling the genetic SNP score with clinical/demographic markers, which warrants further investigation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, multiple SNP testing in BRCA2 and BRCA1 female carriers can improve risk prediction models in conjunction with clinical assessment. The study found that including both clinical/demographic variables and genetic SNP scores in multivariable Cox proportional hazards models or random survival forests improved the predictive ability of risk models for BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers, with average concordance index values of 0.221 and 0.215, respectively."}
{"answers": "Bedtime NPH insulin added to maximal therapy with sulfonylurea and metformin is an effective, simple, well-tolerated approach for patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes.", "prediction_text": "Continuing oral hypoglycemic agents in addition to starting insulin therapy may be associated with a lower rate of treatment failure and less weight gain compared to starting insulin monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes."}
{"answers": "PET data show that amoxapine's profile is very similar to that of the established atypical antipsychotics. These data, together with amoxapine's in vitro pharmacologic profile, effectiveness in animal models, and efficacy in psychotic depression raise the possibility of amoxapine as an \"atypical\" antipsychotic agent in the treatment of schizophrenia.", "prediction_text": "Yes, amoxapine is an atypical antipsychotic, as it meets the criteria mentioned in the medical paper:"}
{"answers": "In gravid ewes, intravenous infusion of<or = 1.67 micrograms/min epinephrine altered neither maternal hemodynamics nor uterine blood flow. To the extent that sheep data can be extrapolated to humans, these results suggest that continuous intravenous infusion of epinephrine in local anesthetic solutions is safe if the epidural catheter should enter a blood vessel during the infusion.", "prediction_text": "Yes, continuous intravenous infusion of low-concentration epinephrine (0.125% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 or 1:400,000 epinephrine) impaired uterine blood flow in pregnant ewes, decreasing it to 68 +/- 14% of baseline."}
{"answers": "These data indicate that major blunt trauma enhances the migratory capacity of circulating neutrophils. This is manifest within 2 hrs of admission and may be attributable to alteration in interleukin-8 receptor expression, affinity, or downstream signaling. In patients who later develop ARDS, initially elevated circulating neutrophil counts decrease rapidly, over the same time course. Early enhanced neutrophil migratory activity coupled with elevated pulmonary concentrations of interleukin-8 may be central to the establishment of the neutrophil infiltration that is characteristic of ARDS.", "prediction_text": "Yes. The study found that neutrophils isolated from the peripheral blood of patients admitted after major trauma exhibited an enhanced migratory response to high concentrations of interleukin-8 throughout the first 24 hours of admission, compared to normal laboratory volunteers. This suggests that increased neutrophil migratory activity after major trauma may play a role in the etiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)."}
{"answers": "Memory provocation increased the sensitivity of rCBF-SPECT for the detection of AD-related blood flow changes in the brain at the group level. Further studies are needed to evaluate MP-SPECT as a diagnostic tool at the individual level. If a higher sensitivity for AD at the individual level is verified in future studies, a single MP-SPECT study might be sufficient in the clinical setting.", "prediction_text": "Yes, memory-provoked rCBF-SPECT (MP-SPECT) has the potential to increase the diagnostic sensitivity in differentiating between Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and normal controls. The study found a significant reduction in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the left parietal cortex in AD patients compared to healthy elderly individuals during a memory provocation task. This suggests that MP-SPECT may be a useful tool in the diagnosis of AD."}

{"answers": "Right ventricular recovery following PVR for chronic significant pulmonary regurgitation after repair of TOF may be compromised in the adult population. In order to maintain adequate RV contractility, pulmonary valve implant in these patients should be considered before RV function deteriorates.", "prediction_text": "No, the study suggests that pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) is not performed too late in adults late after repair of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). The study found that right ventricular volume and function remained unchanged after PVR, and the rate of maintaining a good ejection fraction (RVEF) in patients with pre-operative RVEF>0.40 was higher in patients who underwent PVR compared to those who did not. These findings suggest that PVR can be safely performed in adults with significant pulmonary regurgitation late after TOF repair, and may improve survival outcomes."}
{"answers": "Combined approach tympanoplasty (CAT) allows for successful treatment of cholesteatoma with rates of recurrent and residual disease comparable to open mastoid surgery. Early timing of second-look procedures allows easier removal of any recurrent or residual disease, which reduces the conversion rate to open mastoidectomy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, early second-look tympanoplasty can reduce the rate of conversion to modified radical mastoidectomy. According to the study, the rate of conversion was 3% in cases where second-look surgery was performed within 6 months of primary surgery, compared to 12% in cases where second-look surgery was performed after 12 months."}
{"answers": "In 1995, the first year that the MQSA was in effect, there was a significant improvement in the quality of mammography in North Carolina. This improvement probably resulted from facilities' compliance with federal regulations.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the implementation of the MQSA in 1992 had a significant positive impact on the quality of mammography in North Carolina, as evidenced by the increase in the percentage of facilities meeting quality standards and the improvement in phantom image evaluation, darkroom fog, and developer temperature passing rates from the first to the second inspection."}
{"answers": "HIE was associated with reduced repeat imaging in EDs. This study is among the first to find empirical support for this anticipated benefit of HIE.", "prediction_text": "Yes, health information exchange (HIE) was associated with a reduction in redundant imaging in emergency departments (EDs). Specifically, HIE was found to reduce the probability of repeat CT imaging by 8.7 percentage points, repeat ultrasound imaging by 9.1 percentage points, and repeat chest x-ray imaging by 13.0 percentage points. These reductions represent a 44%-67% decrease in the probability of redundant imaging compared to the sample means."}
{"answers": "Gestational age misclassification is an unlikely explanation for the reported divergence in average birth-weights for Aborigines and whites. The results might help with the interpretation of other between-population comparisons.", "prediction_text": "No, gestational age misclassification does not explain the difference in birthweights for Australian Aborigines and whites. The study found that while misclassification of gestational age can affect the estimates of birthweight centiles, it is not sufficient to explain the observed difference in birthweights between the two groups."}
{"answers": "W-d HCCs were clinically demonstrated not to be early cancer, because there was no significant difference in disease free survival between the patients with w-d and l-d HCCs.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that well-differentiated small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may not be clinically early cancer. The prognosis of well-differentiated HCC is similar to that of less differentiated HCC in terms of disease-free survival, despite the presence of cancer cell infiltration into the fibrous frame of the portal tract in the resected specimen."}
{"answers": "The incidence of post-tonsillectomy late haemorrhage in our study population was 1.78%. A statistically significant difference was found between night-time and day-time haemorrhages.

{"answers": "Patient's age (>60 y) and large polyp size (>10 mm) were significant predictive factors for neoplastic GB polyps. GB polyps less than 10 mm in diameter do not require surgical intervention simply because they grow.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the growth rate of a gallbladder polyp can predict a neoplastic polyp. In this study, the growth rate of the polyp was not directly related to the neoplastic nature of the polyp, but older age and larger size of the polyp were significantly associated with neoplastic polyps."}
{"answers": "These data suggest that the R14C KCNQ1 mutation alone is insufficient to cause AF. Rather, we suggest a model in which a \"second hit\", such as an environmental factor like hypertension, which promotes atrial stretch and thereby unmasks an inherited defect in ion channel kinetics (the \"first hit\"), is required for AF to be manifested. Such a model would also account for the age-related increase in AF development.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found a link between genetic and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation. The mutation identified in the KCNQ1 gene, R14C, was found to be associated with atrial dilation and fibrillation only in older individuals who had developed hypertension. Electrophysiological studies and modeling showed that the mutant channels were more sensitive to stretch and had altered kinetics compared to wild-type channels, suggesting that the mutation may contribute to the development of atrial fibrillation through a mechanism involving stretch sensitivity."}
{"answers": "The real-time PCR approach revealed promising results in pollen identification and quantification, even when analyzing pollen mixes. Future perspectives could concern the development of multiplex real-time PCR for the simultaneous detection of different taxa in the same reaction tube and the application of high-throughput molecular methods.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that the use of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach for the detection and quantification of airborne allergenic pollen taxa is a promising new perspective for aerobiological monitoring.

The incidence of confined placental mosaicism was lower in IVF/ICSI pregnancies compared to spontaneous conceptions, and the incidence of fetal chromosomal anomalies was increased in IVF/ICSI pregnancies, but these differences were not statistically significant."}
{"answers": "For risk stratification in emergency surgical patients, it is essential to measure the APACHE II score before surgical treatment. Longitudinal APACHE II scoring reveals continuous improvement of the score in surviving patients but has no therapeutic relevance in the individual patient.", "prediction_text": "No, the APACHE II score is not a reliable marker of physiological impairment in emergency surgical patients. The study found that the APACHE II score calculated after admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) was significantly higher than the initial score, leading to bias in the comparability of defined groups of patients and in the evaluation of treatment policies. Additionally, the predicted mortality rates based on the APACHE II score at admission to the ICU were significantly different from the observed mortality rates, indicating that the score is not a reliable marker of physiological impairment."}
{"answers": "The methodologic weaknesses of the studies do not permit acceptance of increased risk of tubal pregnancy or infertility as a consequence of perforation of the appendix, so a causal relationship cannot be supported by the data currently available. Only a well-designed case-control study with unbiased ascertainment of exposure and adjustment for confounding variables will provide a definitive answer.", "prediction_text": "Yes, perforation of the appendix is a risk factor for both tubal infertility and ectopic pregnancy, with estimates of the risk ranging from 1.6 to 4.8, depending on the study."}
{"answers": "Cancellous bone plays an important role in primary stability of mini-implants in the presence or absence of cortical bone.", "prediction_text": "Yes, trabecular bone is related to primary stability of miniscrews.

The mean difference in noise levels measured at the external auditory meatus (EAM) was -1.6 dBA (95% CI -4.0 to 0.9 dBA) in favor of HFNC. However, at low frequency (500 Hz), HFNC was found to be 3.0 dBA (95% CI 0.3 to 5.7 dBA) quieter than BCPAP."}
{"answers": "Patients with a history of ACD are at an increased risk of having recurrent preterm birth and cervical shortening in a subsequent pregnancy compared with women with prior preterm birth associated PPROM or PTL.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the clinical presentation of a prior preterm birth (SPTB) predicts the risk of recurrent preterm birth in a subsequent pregnancy. Specifically, women who had a prior preterm birth with advanced cervical dilatation (ACD) have a higher risk of recurrent preterm birth compared to those with a prior preterm birth due to preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) or preterm labor (PTL)."}
{"answers": "This illustrates that Paget's disease does exist in India and a high index of suspicion is required to clinch the diagnosis.", "prediction_text": "Yes, Paget's disease exists in India. The study found 21 patients with Paget's disease in a population of 213 patients with bone disorders, indicating a prevalence of 9.4%. The most commonly involved bones were the skull and spine, followed by the pelvis, femur, tibia, and ulna. The mean serum alkaline phosphatase level at diagnosis was high (1514 IU/L), and after treatment with bisphosphonates, it decreased to a lower level (454 IU/L)."}
{"answers": "The results of the present study show that idiopathic incidental misty mesentery appearance has a significant prevalence. Also, the high body mass index of these patients and the growing evidence of obesity-induced inflammatory changes in adipose tissue are suggestive of an association between obesity and misty mesentery appearance on CT.", "prediction_text": "The prevalence of incidentally detected idiopathic misty mesentery on multidetector computed tomography (CT) is 7%. Obesity may be a triggering cause of this condition."}
{"answers": "Percutaneous ethanol injection without aspiration of ethanol-mixed fluid seems to be the preferable method of treatment of benign cystic thyroid nodules from the perspective of both the physician and the patient.", "prediction_text": "No, aspiration of ethanol-mixed fluid during percutaneous ethanol injection for benign cystic thyroid nodules is not advantageous. The study found no significant difference in the success rates of complete disappearance of the cystic portion of the thyroid nodule between the aspiration and non-aspiration groups. Additionally, aspiration was associated with a higher risk of intracystic hemorrhage and a longer total procedure time."}
{"answers": "The present study, which is based on internationally accepted assessment tools for SLE patients, shows a significant relationship between increased disease activity and reduced physical function. This result emphasizes the importance of optimizing treatment aiming at reducing disease activity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there are associations between health status, disease activity, and damage in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) patients. The study found that increased disease activity (measured by BILAG index) was significantly correlated with reduced physical function, while greater damage (measured by SDI) correlated significantly with reduced role function due to emotional limitations. However, neither age nor disease duration showed any significant correlation with health status in this study."}
{"answers": "The morbidity associated with desmoid tumors has not been shown to differ, whether they arise after restorative proctocolectomy or ileorectal anastomosis.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no significant difference in the clinical course of intra-abdominal desmoid disease between patients with an ileal pouch and those with an ileorectal anastomosis."}
{"answers": "These findings provide evidence for the existence of a high-IQ variant of schizophrenia that is associated with markedly fewer negative symptoms than typical schizophrenia, and lends support to the idea of a psychosis spectrum or continuum over boundaried diagnostic categories.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that there may be a clinically distinct sub-type of schizophrenia among patients with high intelligence, characterized by lower levels of negative and disorganized symptoms and better global functioning and insight."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that hearing loss caused by GM otic drops may be reduced by the inclusion of BM and benzalkonium chloride. Our finding that BM alone was associated with hearing loss suggests that the benzalkonium chloride may be the protective agent in combination otic drops.", "prediction_text": "No, the use of steroids in aminoglycoside-containing ear drops does not reduce cochlear toxicity."}
{"answers": "A fetal anatomic survey on follow-up sonograms may identify unanticipated fetal anomalies, especially when the indication is for fetal growth.", "prediction_text": "Yes, fetal anatomic assessment on follow-up antepartum sonograms is clinically useful in identifying unanticipated fetal anomalies, particularly for neonates whose mothers had sonographic examinations for fetal growth evaluation."}
{"answers": "Patients with BRAF-mutant PTC had a significantly longer PFS than BRAF wild-type when treated with TKIs. However, due to the small number of BRAF-mutant patients, further investigations are required, especially to understand the potential positive effect of BRAF mutations in RAIR TC patients while having a negative prognostic impact in RAI-sensitive PTC patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the molecular genotype of radioiodine-refractory thyroid cancers (RAIR-TCs) can provide useful information in the management of these cancers. In this study, BRAF mutation was found to positively influence median progression-free survival (PFS) in both the entire TKI-treated cohort and the TKI-treated papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) subtype. However, in the multivariate analysis, the PDTC histologic subtype was the only independent prognostic factor for PFS. These findings suggest that molecular genotyping can help identify patients who are likely to"}
{"answers": "The frequency and topographic distribution of LNM are not modified by NACT, and clinical non-responders showed more involved LNs. A systemic and extensive lymphadenectomy should be performed in patients treated with NACT plus surgery regardless of the response to NACT.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the extent of lymphadenectomy can be modified by neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in cervical cancer. The incidence of lymph node metastasis was significantly decreased in the NACT-responsive group compared to the non-responsive group, and the metastatic rates for every lymph node group also declined in the NACT-responsive group except for the deep inguinal and the para-aortic lymph node groups."}
{"answers": "A prior benign prostate biopsy may be independently associated with more favorable surgical and biochemical outcomes after prostatectomy. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings.", "prediction_text": "Yes, prior benign prostate biopsy predicts better outcome for patients treated with radical perineal prostatectomy. Patients who had prior benign biopsies had more favorable pathologic features, including more organ-confined and less margin-positive disease, and lower probability of biochemical failure compared to those without prior biopsies."}
{"answers": "This clinical trial evaluated the possible reduction in intervention-related myocardial damage that was attributable to remote postischemic conditioning.", "prediction_text": "Yes, remote ischemic postconditioning (RIPC) protects against ischemic damage in percutaneous coronary revascularization (PCI) in both stable angina and non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome patients, including those with diabetes."}

{"answers": "Septal suturing after septoplasty offers the following advantages: elimination of discomfort for the patients, minimal complications, the outcome is almost the same as with nasal packing, and finally the hospital stay is less than with nasal packing. Therefore, suturing of the nasal septum after septoplasty should be a preferred alternative to nasal packing.", "prediction_text": "Suturing the nasal septum after septoplasty is not an effective alternative to nasal packing. The study found that suturing the nasal septum resulted in a higher incidence of minor oozing, bleeding, and septal hematoma compared to nasal packing. Additionally, there was a longer operating time in the suturing group."}
{"answers": "The present study does not support the recommendation of ultrasound as a conclusive diagnostic tool for internal derangements of the temporomandibular joint.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, ultrasound imaging has lower sensitivity compared to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in detecting internal derangements of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Therefore, ultrasound may not be a reliable method for detecting TMJ internal derangements."}
{"answers": "Our results showed that the serum leptin level has no prognostic indications in advanced lung cancer patients. Leptin is decreased in lung cancer, and there is lack of correlation with tumour\u2011related factors including prognosis. Therefore, leptin is not a useful clinical marker in lung cancer (Tab. 2, Fig. 2, Ref. 22).", "prediction_text": "No, serum leptin levels are not a prognostic factor in advanced lung cancer."}
{"answers": "We found no evidence of serovar specific immunity in our population. It remains possible that populations with a higher prevalence of gonorrhoea and more frequent infections may have a quantitatively greater immune response.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no significant evidence of serovar-specific immunity to Neisseria gonorrhoeae, as the study found no difference in the prevalence of serovars isolated following a repeat infection compared to those without repeat infections."}
{"answers": "BPPV is associated with positive viral serology, particularly during certain months of the year, mainly in spring and autumn. Viral infection might promote BPPV attacks due to the development of vestibulopathy or induce secondary BPPV via viral infection-related neurolabyrinthitis.", "prediction_text": "Yes, viral infections play a role in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). The study found that the BPPV group had higher levels of serum viral agents (HSV1, HSV2, Herpes zoster, EBV, CMV, adenovirus, influenza, and parainfluenza virus) compared to the control group, with seasonal variations in the levels of certain viruses."}
{"answers": "We found increased post-ictal serum cytokine levels in patients with several epilepsy syndromes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that there is a role of cytokines in epilepsy. The levels of certain cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6) were found to be elevated in the serum of patients with epilepsy compared to healthy controls. Additionally, there were correlations between certain cytokine levels and various clinical parameters, such as male gender, positive family history, and duration of epilepsy. Furthermore, serial analysis during the seizure-free period revealed a decrease in cytokine levels in the patients. These findings suggest that cytokines may play a role in the pathophys"}
{"answers": "Neuromedin U reduces insulin and increases somatostatin secretion. Blockade of somatostatin action abolishes the inhibition of insulin secretion by NmU. The results of the study suggest that somatostatin mediates the inhibitory action of NmU on insulin secretion.", "prediction_text": "Yes, somatostatin confers insulinostatic effects of neuromedin U in the rat pancreas."}
{"answers": "Patients with fewer or anterior sutures have shorter OR times. However, 30-day readmission, band-related reoperation, and postoperative weight loss were unaffected by number or location of suture. The technical aspects of HHR did not appear to be associated with readmission or reoperation, and therefore a standardized approach may not be necessary.", "prediction_text": "The location and number of sutures used for hiatal hernia repair during laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) do matter, with differences in operating room time and length of stay (LOS) depending on the number of sutures used. Specifically, patients with one suture had shorter OR time, while those with posterior suture had longer LOS. There was no significant difference in other outcomes such as readmission, reoperation, and postoperative BMI/%EWL."}
{"answers": "Survivors of lobar ICH with atrial fibrillation should not be offered long-term anticoagulation. Similarly, most patients with deep hemispheric ICH and atrial fibrillation should not receive anticoagulant therapy. However, patients with deep hemispheric ICH at particularly high risk for thromboembolic stroke or low risk of ICH recurrence might benefit from long-term anticoagulation.", "prediction_text": "The decision to anticoagulate patients with a history of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is complex and depends on various factors. Our analysis suggests that withholding anticoagulation therapy may be the preferred option for patients with a prior lobar ICH, as it can improve quality-adjusted life expectancy by 1.9 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). However, for patients with a prior deep hemispheric ICH, the gain in QALYs is smaller, at 0.3 QALYs. In sensitivity analyses, anticoagulation may be"}
{"answers": "This study showed that FDG is not a good surrogate tracer for tumor hypoxia under either ambient or hypoxic conditions. Only specific hypoxia tracers should be used to measure tumor hypoxia.", "prediction_text": "No, (18)F-FDG is not a reliable surrogate tracer to measure tumor hypoxia. The study found that there is a decreasing similarity between (14)C-EF3 and (18)F-FDG under normoxic conditions, and this similarity decreases further under hypoxic conditions. The Dice similarity index (DSI) values for (14)C-EF3 and (18)F-FDG were lower under hypoxia than under normoxia, indicating that (18)F-FDG is not a reliable measure of tumor hypoxia."}
{"answers": "A task-specific intervention designed to improve gait speed may potentially provide secondary benefits by positively impacting depression, mobility and social participation for people post stroke.", "prediction_text": "Yes, treadmill training post-stroke has secondary benefits in terms of improving depression, mobility, and social participation."}
{"answers": "Orthostatic myoclonus is often underdiagnosed and can be considered a possible cause of unsteadiness in subjects with neurodegenerative diseases. Electromyography surface recording is thereby an aid for investigating unsteadiness of unknown origin.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that orthostatic myoclonus (OM) is an underrecognized cause of unsteadiness in neurodegenerative diseases. The study found that OM was the most frequent disorder among the subjects with unexplained unsteadiness/gait impairment, and that 68.7% of the patients with OM had an associated neurodegenerative disease. The study also found that leg jerking was only observed by visual inspection during orthostatism in some subjects, and that four subjects showed improvement of orthostatic myoclonus with antimyoclonic treatment, although the follow-up was not systematic enough to"}
{"answers": "Severely injured patients treated at a level III center had a higher mortality rate than those treated at a level I center. Most problems identified occurred in the emergency department and were related to delays in care provision. This research highlights the importance of efficient prehospital, in-hospital, and regional trauma systems, performance monitoring, peer review, and adherence to protocols and guidelines.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the level of trauma center providing treatment to severely injured adult trauma patients in an Australian health service makes a significant difference in terms of mortality and hospital length of stay. Specifically, patients who presented to a level III trauma center had a higher risk of death compared to those who presented to a level I trauma center, even after adjusting for factors such as age, sex, Injury Severity Score (ISS), and prehospital time. Additionally, a review of deaths at the level III trauma center identified problems in care delivery, including technical errors, delay in decision making, and errors of judgment."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that very few genes, which change their expression level during the WOI, show a quantitative homogeneous expression in endometrially-receptive patients. In conclusion, in this study only six genes showed a homogeneous expression, and are probably involved in embryo implantation mechanisms.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no uniform basal endometrial gene expression profile during the implantation window in women who became pregnant in a subsequent ICSI cycle. Only 6 out of 43 genes analyzed showed a statistically uniform expression among patients who subsequently became pregnant."}
{"answers": "While SSA would be the first region to experience the huge benefits of implementing the \"test and treat\" policy of the WHO, the region is not yet prepared to manage the consequential increased burden of ART-related toxic and metabolic complications. Urgent measures should be taken to fill the lacunae if SSA is not to become over-burdened by the consequences of the \"test and treat\" policy.", "prediction_text": "Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is unlikely to cope effectively with the increased incidence of antiretroviral therapy (ART) related adverse effects due to the region's weak health systems, inadequate health services, and lack of resources."}
{"answers": "In summary we believe sudden onset chest wall rigidity may be a significant and previously unreported factor leading to an increased mortality, from illicit IV fentanyl use. Fentanyl and norfentanyl ratios and concentrations suggest a more rapid onset of death given the finding of fentanyl without norfentanyl in many of the fatalities. Chest wall rigidity may help explain the cause of death in these instances, in contrast to the typical opioid-related overdose deaths. Intravenous heroin users should be educated regarding this potentially fatal complication given the increasingly common substitution and combination with heroin of fentanyl.", "prediction_text": "Yes, chest wall rigidity could be a factor in rapid death from illicit fentanyl abuse. The study found that rapid intravenous administration of fentanyl can produce chest wall rigidity, which could lead to respiratory arrest and death. The lack of any measurable norfentanyl in half of the cases suggests that the deaths occurred very rapidly, consistent with acute chest rigidity."}
{"answers": "There appears to be no benefit in metformin co-treatment before and during IVF in women with PCO without any other features of PCOS. Clinical Trials.gov: NCT01046032.", "prediction_text": "No, women with ovaries of polycystic morphology without any other features of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) do not benefit from short-term metformin co-treatment during in vitro fertilization (IVF). The study found no significant improvements in live birth rate, clinical pregnancy rate, or severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) in the metformin group compared to the placebo group."}
{"answers": "The study suggests that ventilating an adult patient is possible with a smaller, pediatric-sized BVM. The tidal volumes recorded with the pediatric BVM were more consistent with lung-protective ventilation volumes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, EMS providers can provide appropriate tidal volumes in a simulated adult-sized patient with a pediatric-sized bag-valve-mask (BVM). The study found that when using the pediatric BVM, only 1.5% of breaths delivered were below the recommended tidal volume, and a greater percentage of breaths were delivered in the recommended range compared to when using the adult BVM. The median tidal volumes for each scenario were lower when using the pediatric BVM, indicating that EMS providers were able to provide appropriate volumes in a simulated adult-sized patient."}
{"answers": "Our results suggest that colonoscopy does not affect the management of patients with acute diverticulitis nor alter the outcome. The current practice of a routine colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis, diagnosed by typical clinical symptoms and CT needs to be reevaluated.", "prediction_text": "No, a colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis does not significantly affect its management."}
{"answers": "Pretreatment ECG is of limited value for patients with an unremarkable cardiovascular history and a normal heart rate and blood pressure. Hypotension may occur during treatment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, cardiovascular evaluation is necessary prior to and during beta-blocker therapy for infantile hemangiomas. The study found that while there were no serious complications or contraindications to beta-blocker therapy, 6.5% of patients had ECG abnormalities and 9 patients experienced hypotension that did not require therapy adjustment. Additionally, 81% of parents reported side effects during treatment."}
{"answers": "Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is a promising option for lifelong treatment of type 2 diabetes. It has the potential to improve or cure a selected spectrum of type 1 diabetes when performed early in the disease. Further animal model studies or randomized controlled trials are needed to support our conclusion.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass can provide a lifelong solution for diabetes mellitus in obese patients with type 2 diabetes. The study found that gastric bypass surgery has proven to be highly effective in treating type 2 diabetes, with a significant improvement in glucose levels and a potential cure for the disease in some cases. However, it is important to note that the study did not investigate the long-term effects of gastric bypass surgery on type 1 diabetes, and more research is needed to determine its effectiveness in this population."}
{"answers": "Collectively, results suggest that behavioral adaptation to ESC is likely in certain drivers; however, its proven effectiveness in reducing the likelihood of being involved in a serious crash probably outweighs any potential increases in unsafe driving. To fully benefit from ESC, vehicle manufacturers are encouraged to market ESC-equipped vehicles in a realistic, safe manner. Driver training and safety organizations are also encouraged to provide balanced educational information about ESC to their members.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that the widespread introduction of ESC into the Canadian vehicle fleet could lead to behavioral adaptation and changes in driving behavior among drivers. While the majority of ESC-equipped drivers were aware of the technology and reported feeling safer and more confident behind the wheel, 23% of drivers who knew their vehicle had ESC reported noticing long-lasting changes in their driving behavior since they began driving the vehicle."}
{"answers": "The results of the study demonstrate that when clinical supervision uses best practice principles, it can provide professional support for allied health workers, even during times of rapid organisational change.", "prediction_text": "Yes, clinical supervision can sustain the workforce in the current healthcare landscape. The study found that the length, number, and total period of supervision sessions were significantly positively correlated with the effectiveness of clinical supervision, indicating that more frequent and longer supervision sessions can lead to better outcomes. Additionally, having a choice in the allocation of clinical supervisor and having a completed supervision agreement were also associated with higher effectiveness scores. These findings suggest that clinical supervision can be an effective mechanism for supporting and developing the skills of allied health professionals, which is crucial in the current healthcare landscape where workforce sustainability is a major concern."}
{"answers": "Both 'economic/employment' and 'social/welfare' dimensions of social exclusion significantly influence suicide mortality among males. The influence of 'economic/employment' and 'social/welfare' dimensions of social exclusion on female suicide mortality is controversial. Social exclusion might be considered as a risk factor for suicide mortality in Europe.", "prediction_text": "Yes, some aspects of social exclusion, specifically the \"economic/employment\" and \"social/welfare\" dimensions, are found to influence suicide mortality among both males and females in Europe."}
{"answers": "While ultrasound examination is inexpensive and easily done, it is not accurate enough for staging small penile cancers located at the glans penis. However, for larger tumors ultrasound can be a useful addition to physical examination by delineating reliably the anatomic relations of the tumor to structures such as the tunica albuginea, corpus cavernosum, and urethra.", "prediction_text": "Yes, ultrasound examination can be a useful addition to clinical staging in squamous cell carcinoma of the penis, particularly in assessing the extent of invasion into the corpora."}
{"answers": "This study confirms that a large percentage of patients use metered-dose inhalers improperly. It also demonstrates a significant lack of understanding by health care providers of the proper use of metered-dose inhalers. Furthermore, this study supports the use of respiratory care practitioners in the outpatient setting, since they were the most proficient among all the health care providers in the proper use of metered-dose inhalers.", "prediction_text": "Health care providers, including house staff, nurses, and respiratory care practitioners, have varying levels of proficiency in the proper use of metered-dose inhalers, with respiratory care practitioners being the most knowledgeable. However, a significant percentage of patients also have a poor understanding of the technique used with metered-dose inhalers."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrated that the regional or global apex of a given curve is the most rotated level in only a minority of the curves. The most rotated level may be as far as two levels from the global apex and one level from the regional apex.", "prediction_text": "No, the transverse apex (most rotated vertebral level) does not always coincide with the coronal apex levels (regional or global) in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. The study found that the regional and global apex levels were at the same level in 54.5% of curves, within half a level in 45.4%, and one level higher in 2% of curves. There was a higher variability in the difference between the most rotated levels and the regional and global apex levels, extending up to two levels for the global apex."}
{"answers": "Generalization of the RCT sample was supported, because only 7.8% of Phenomenology subjects did not fit the RCT criteria. Nevertheless, because the RCT subjects were more severely ill, it is unclear if treatment findings from the RCT will be applicable to children with less severe mania.", "prediction_text": "The \"Treatment of Early Age Mania (TEAM)\" sample does not generalize well to the diagnostic characteristics of child bipolar I disorder. The TEAM sample had a higher prevalence of mania symptoms, ultradian rapid cycling, psychosis, and suicidality compared to the \"Phenomenology and Course of Pediatric Bipolar Disorders\" sample."}
{"answers": "Experts across Europe asserted the right to culturally sensitive health care for all immigrants. There is a broad consensus among experts about the major principles of good practice that need to be implemented across Europe. However, there also is some disagreement both within and between countries on specific issues that require further research and debate.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is still consensus among country experts in Europe on the principles of good practice for health care for immigrants, despite local political and cultural influences. Nine themes emerged from the study, including easy and equal access to health care, empowerment of migrants, culturally sensitive health care services, quality of care, patient/health care provider communication, respect towards migrants, networking in and outside health services, targeted outreach activities, and availability of data about specificities in migrant health care and prevention. While there was some discordance within and between countries, there was a broad European consensus on most factors."}
{"answers": "Biochemical analysis of injured cervical intervertebral disks reveals the presence of inflammatory markers such as MCP, fragments of structural matrix proteins such as FAC, and a correlation with pH. Further evaluation of the FAC as a potential diagnostic biomarker or therapeutic target is warranted in the cervical spine.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the fibronectin-aggrecan complex (FAC) is present in cervical disk disease. The study found a statistically significant correlation between the FAC and MCP, as well as between the FAC and pH in the lavage fluid obtained from patients with cervical radiculopathy caused by disk herniation."}

This approach led to a 19% increase in time to reach ventilatory threshold, which is indicative of improved fitness.", "prediction_text": "Yes, training at an intensity that feels \"good\" through affect-regulated exercise can improve physical health. The study found a significant increase in time to reach ventilatory threshold in the training group compared to the control group, indicating improved cardiovascular fitness."}
{"answers": "In Southern Italy, hepatitis G virus infection is widespread among patients with chronic hepatitis, independently of parenteral risk factors. Its frequency in subjects with cryptogenic liver disease parallels that observed in hepatitis C virus chronic liver disease, thus ruling out an aetiologic role of hepatitis G virus. TT virus infection is uncommon in patients with cryptogenic or hepatitis C virus-related liver disease who do not have a history of parenteral exposure.", "prediction_text": "The study found that hepatitis G virus infection is not significantly more common in patients with cryptogenic chronic liver disease compared to those with hepatitis C virus-related chronic liver disease. However, the presence of at least one marker of hepatitis G virus infection (hepatitis G virus-RNA and/or anti-hepatitis G virus) was found in 26.1% of patients with cryptogenic chronic liver disease and 40% of patients with hepatitis C virus-related chronic liver disease, suggesting that hepatitis G virus may play a role in the development of chronic liver disease."}
{"answers": "Our findings suggest that somatic complaints may represent one, but not necessarily the most important, risk factor for the subsequent development of depressive symptoms in women in nonclinical populations. The results also highlight the importance of including social variables in studies on women's depression as well as conducting additional research to further examine predictors of depressive symptoms in men.", "prediction_text": "Yes, somatic complaints (assessed using the SCL-90-R somatization subscale) predict subsequent symptoms of depressed mood 5 years later in women, but not in men."}
{"answers": "Peak inspiratory pressure, PEEP, and ventilation index values could distinguish survivors from nonsurvivors by day 3. This may assist in early application of supportive nonconventional therapies in children with malignancy and ARDS.", "prediction_text": "Yes, early respiratory predictors of mortality in children with hemato-oncology malignancy who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can be predicted by measuring peak inspiratory pressure, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and ventilation index values by day 3 after onset of mechanical ventilation, and by assessing respiratory data and outcome related to efficiency of oxygenation from day 8 after onset of mechanical ventilation."}
{"answers": "In this small study serum inhibin concentrations higher than those found in the early follicular phase one to two weeks after evacuation of a hydatidiform mole seemed to be specific for persistent trophoblastic disease. Further data are needed to confirm these promising results.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that inhibin may be a useful new circulating marker for the diagnosis and monitoring of hydatidiform mole. The study found that the serum concentrations of inhibin in patients with hydatidiform mole were significantly higher than in normal pregnant women, and that the concentrations declined significantly after evacuation of the mole. Additionally, the study found that patients whose serum inhibin concentrations were 0.4 U/ml or less after evacuation did not develop persistent trophoblastic disease. These findings suggest that inhibin may be a useful marker for the diagnosis and monitoring of hydatidiform mole, and may be able to identify"}
{"answers": "The integration of whole-lesion dynamic data tends to improve specificity. However, no statistical significance backs up this finding.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, analyzing the whole lesion time curve distribution in MR-mammography (MRM) using computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) software is not necessary for accurate diagnosis. The study found that the most suspect curve, curve-type distribution percentage, and combined dynamic data had similar diagnostic accuracy, and the differences did not achieve statistical significance. Therefore, the conclusion is that while the whole lesion time curve distribution analysis may provide additional information, it is not a necessary component of CAD analysis in MRM."}
{"answers": "The seemingly exaggerated traditional fear of anaphylaxis seems to discourage surgeons from more widely adopting minimal access techniques for the treatment of hydatid cyst.", "prediction_text": "Yes, fear of anaphylactic shock is a significant discouragement for surgeons in adopting percutaneous and laparoscopic techniques in the treatment of liver hydatid cysts."}
{"answers": "Grandmultiparous women had increased maternal and neonatal morbidity, and neonatal mortality even after controlling for confounders, suggesting a need for closer observation than regular multiparous patients during labor and delivery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, grandmultiparity is an independent risk factor for adverse perinatal outcomes, including abruptio placentae, preterm delivery, fetal macrosomia, neonatal death, postpartum hemorrhage, and blood transfusion."}
{"answers": "No single data source is likely to provide a complete health profile for an individual. For women with depression in pregnancy and dispensed antidepressants, the hospital admission data do not adequately capture all cases.", "prediction_text": "No, women with major depression in pregnancy are not identifiable in population health data using the data linkage methodology used in the study. The study found that only 13.6% of pregnant women who were dispensed antidepressants had depression recorded as a comorbidity on their hospital records, indicating that the majority of women with depression (80%) were not captured by the hospital admission data. Additionally, a simple capture-recapture calculation suggested that the prevalence of depression in this population of pregnant women was around 16%, which is higher than the 4.6% of pregnant women who were identified through dispensing claims data"}
{"answers": "These data suggest a pattern of diagnostic stability over time for manic and mixed episodes in patients with bipolar disorder. Careful prospective studies of this issue are needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the manic/mixed episode distinction in patients with bipolar disorder runs true over time, as the observed distribution of manic and mixed episodes was found to be significantly more consistent than would be expected by chance in an 11-year period."}
{"answers": "The analyses show that structural characteristics of a practice are not associated with uptake of a new IT facility, but that its use may be influenced by post-graduate education in the relevant clinical condition. For this diabetes system at least, practice nurse use was critical in spreading uptake beyond initial GP enthusiasts and for sustained and rising use in subsequent years.", "prediction_text": "Yes, general practice characteristics, such as total list size, training status, numbers of GPs, mean age of the GPs, numbers of female GPs, level of deprivation of the population, and the number of diabetes-educated staff, influence the uptake of an IT innovation in primary care. Specifically, practices with more diabetes-educated staff were associated with increased use of the information system by both nurses and GPs."}
{"answers": "GAPS, a simple clinical score, is a better predictor of admission than triage nurses, unless the nurse is sure about the outcome, in which case their clinical judgement should be respected.", "prediction_text": "Yes, GAPS significantly outperformed VAS in predicting admission at triage, with better calibration, discrimination, and accuracy. When clinical certainty was \u226595%, GAPS significantly outperformed both VAS and the combination of GAPS and over-ruling."}
{"answers": "Our data showed no difference in 25(OH) D levels between normal children and those with CD when adjusted for body mass index.", "prediction_text": "No, vitamin D deficiency is not a feature of pediatric celiac disease. The study found no significant difference in vitamin D levels between children with celiac disease and non-celiac children. However, when the patients were subdivided into obese and non-obese groups, the non-obese celiac patients had a higher vitamin D level than the obese normal children."}
{"answers": "Granulomatous myelotoxicity and enteritis developed in a 21 year old female within 3 weeks of initiating sulfasalazine for rheumatoid arthritis. Following a short course of corticosteroids, the patient had resolution of her cholestatic hepatitis, rash, eosinophilia, and gastrointestinal symptoms with no residual manifestations at 7 months follow-up. Although severe reactions to sulfasalazine are rare and unpredictable, practicing physicians should be aware of unusual clinical presentations of toxicity when prescribing sulfasalazine.", "prediction_text": "No, the patient in the medical paper is not diagnosed with Crohn's disease. The patient is actually diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, and the severe systemic reaction to sulfasalazine is characterized by eosinophilia, granulomatous enteritis, myelotoxicity, cholestatic hepatitis, and seizures."}
{"answers": "Healthy lifestyles lead to an increase in the utilization of preventive health services. However, there is not much significantly reducing the number of outpatient visits in people with health behaviors. Specifically, people with regular exercise habits and who take their blood pressure measurement regularly have an increased number of outpatient visits. It is suggested that more available and accessible health consultation services be provided to inculcate in the general public the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle.", "prediction_text": "Yes, this study found that individuals with healthier lifestyles tend to utilize healthcare resources less. Specifically, the study found that those who engaged in regular exercise, had healthy dietary habits, measured their blood pressure regularly, and did not drink excessively, had fewer outpatient visits and health examinations compared to those with less healthy lifestyles."}
{"answers": "Parental restriction of R-rated movie viewing is associated with both lower adolescent smoking susceptibility and lower smoking rates.", "prediction_text": "Yes, parental restriction of R-rated movie viewing is associated with lower adolescent smoking susceptibility. The study found a strong correlation between parental restriction and lower smoking susceptibility, and when controlling for demographic factors and family and friend smoking, respondents with partial or no restriction were more likely to be susceptible to smoking."}
{"answers": "Having a usual physician can be an effective tool in improving access to care for low-income populations, although it is most effective when combined with insurance coverage. However, the effectiveness of managed care in linking more low-income persons to a medical home is uncertain, and may have unintended consequences for uninsured persons.", "prediction_text": "No, managed care does not enable more low-income persons to identify a usual source of care. In fact, high managed care penetration in the community is associated with a lower likelihood of having a usual source of care for uninsured persons."}
{"answers": "Locally 1.0% ropivacaine administration significantly relieves the pain of pediatric tonsillectomy and, it is a safe and effective method. High concentrations of ropivaciane may produce clinically significant pain relief. It is more effective to reduce of post-operative analgesic requirement after first hour.", "prediction_text": "Yes, topical ropivacaine reduces post-tonsillectomy morbidity in pediatric patients. The study found that the ropivacaine group had a significant reduction in pain during the first hour after surgery compared to the control group, and this effect was maintained throughout the rest of the post-operative period. Additionally, there were no significant differences in other post-operative parameters such as nausea, fever, vomiting, odor, bleeding, otalgia, and trismus between the two groups. However, it is important to note that the study had a small sample size and further larger-scale studies are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Minimally invasive mitral valve repair using neochords provided a high rate of repair, reproducible results in a routine cardiac surgery setting and stable repair during follow-up. This has become our preferred technique for mitral valve surgery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, minimally invasive mitral valve repair with artificial chords is reproducible and applicable in routine surgery. The study found that the use of neochords in video-assisted mitral valve repair resulted in a high repair rate (99.8%) and low rates of recurrent mitral regurgitation (3.5%) and reoperation (1.2%). The study also found that patients were fast-tracked and had quick recovery, with 25% extubated in the operation theatre and the remainder within 6 hours. Additionally, there were no de-insertion or rupture of any neochords and no patients required a reoperation during the follow-up period of"}
{"answers": "Comparisons of absolute EOA values grouped by the manufacturers' valve sizes are misleading because of specific differences in geometric dimensions. The EOA:patient aortic annulus area ratio provides a new hemodynamic index which may facilitate objective comparisons between different valve types.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the effective orifice area (EOA) / patient aortic annulus area ratio is a better way to compare different bioprostheses in isolated aortic valve replacement (AVR) procedures."}
{"answers": "Women compared to men often delay seeking treatment for an AMI, which further increases their risks. Our findings suggest specific characteristics that can serve as a profile to those African Americans most likely to delay seeking treatment for AMI.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that women were more likely than men to delay seeking medical help for symptoms of acute myocardial infarction due to several reasons, including:"}
{"answers": "A reduced alveolar macrophage phagocytic host response to apoptotic cells or NTHi may contribute to neutrophilic inflammation and NTHi colonization in both PBB and bronchiectasis. Whether this mechanism also contributes to the progression of PBB to bronchiectasis remains unknown.", "prediction_text": "Yes, alveolar macrophage phagocytic dysfunction is a forerunner to bronchiectasis in children with protracted bacterial bronchitis. The study found that children with bronchiectasis or protracted bacterial bronchitis had significantly lower macrophage phagocytic capacity compared to control subjects, and this dysfunction was associated with reduced expression of phagocytic scavenger receptors and increased inflammation. These findings suggest that impaired macrophage function may be an early marker of disease progression in children with bronchiectasis."}
{"answers": "Cervical physical therapy can have a positive effect on subjective tinnitus complaints in patients with a combination of tinnitus and neck complaints. Larger studies, using more responsive outcome measures, are however necessary to prove this effect.", "prediction_text": "Yes, multi-modal cervical physical therapy improves tinnitus in patients with cervicogenic somatic tinnitus (CST). The study found that Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) and Neck Bournemouth Questionnaire (NBQ) scores significantly decreased after treatment and remained lower after follow-up at six weeks. Additionally, 53% of patients experienced substantial improvement of tinnitus immediately after treatment, and 24% maintained this improvement after follow-up."}
{"answers": "Because workers may have an elevated relative aerobic workload for several hours each working day, this relationship may elucidate a mechanism behind the increased risk for cardiovascular disease among workers exposed to high levels of occupational physical activity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found a positive relationship between aerobic workload and ambulatory blood pressure (ABP). Specifically, a 1% increase in mean relative aerobic workload was associated with an increase of 0.42 \u00b1 0.05 mmHg in systolic ABP and 0.30 \u00b1 0.04 mmHg in diastolic ABP."}
{"answers": "Our investigation did not undoubtedly prove that significant changes of fetal biometric parameters occurred in the last three decades. It is possible that secular growth acceleration does not exist in prenatal period but also the observed time period could have been short for this phenomenon to manifest.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no statistically significant difference in fetal growth parameters between the current population and those from 35 years ago, suggesting that secular growth acceleration does not occur during fetal life."}
{"answers": "Consistent with prior studies, we found an inverse relationship between obesity and serum prostate specific antigen. However, the magnitude of the difference was small. Thus, adjusting prostate specific antigen for body mass index does not appear warranted.", "prediction_text": "No, prostate specific antigen (PSA) should not be adjusted for body mass index (BMI) in men without prostate cancer, as there was no significant association between BMI and PSA after adjusting for age."}
{"answers": "Emergency laparotomy carries a high rate of mortality, especially in those over the age of 70 years, and more needs to be done to improve outcomes, particularly in this group. This could involve increasing acute surgical care manpower, early recognition of patients requiring emergency surgery, development of clear management protocols for such patients or perhaps even considering centralisation of emergency surgical services to specialist centres with multidisciplinary teams involving emergency surgeons and care of the elderly physicians in hospital and related community outreach services for post-discharge care.", "prediction_text": "Yes, 30-day and 1-year mortality in emergency general surgery laparotomies is an area of concern and need for improvement, with a 12.4% 30-day mortality rate in patients aged <70 years and a 22% mortality rate in those aged >70 years, and a 25.15% 1-year mortality rate in patients aged <70 years and a 38% mortality rate in those aged >70 years."}
{"answers": "[corrected] This observation is exceptional in many aspects: very early age of onset of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, no immune deficit, association with a rare congenital neurological syndrome. We discuss the possible link between this entity and the occurrence of tuberculosis.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a probable causative link between the Say-Barber-Miller syndrome and the occurrence of cerebromediastinal tuberculosis in the child described in the medical paper."}
{"answers": "The signal intensity on DWI showed no significant difference in the development of vascularization.", "prediction_text": "No, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is not a significant indicator of the development of vascularization in hypovascular hepatocellular lesions (HHLs)."}
{"answers": "General practitioners should consider using patients' first names more often, particularly with younger patients.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, the majority of patients (223) liked being called by their first names by doctors, while 175 did not mind it. However, only 324 patients did not want to call the doctor by their first name. Therefore, the answer to the question is that general practitioners should consider calling patients by their first names, but it is important to take into account the preferences of the elderly patients who may not be comfortable with it."}
{"answers": "Patients after ART treatment suffer from higher C-section rates during their stage of delivery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patients who underwent Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) have a higher risk of cesarean section (C-section) during delivery, particularly in the groups of fresh transferred embryos and slow freezing. The odds ratio for elective C-sections was 2.0 (95% CI: 1.6-2.6) and for emergency C-sections was 1.4 (95% CI: 1.1-1.9)."}
{"answers": "Trauma patients have a significant complication rate related to anticoagulation therapy, and predicting which patients will develop a complication remains unclear. Prospective studies are needed to determine which treatment regimen, if any, is appropriate to safely anticoagulate this high risk population.", "prediction_text": "The study found that therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients is associated with a risk of complications, including bleeding and hemorrhage. The incidence of complications was found to be 21% in the study population. The patient factors that were found to be associated with an increased risk of complications were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, use of unfractionated heparin (UH) instead of fractionated heparin (FH), and lower initial platelet count. The study suggests that therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients is not entirely safe and that careful consideration should be given to the potential risks and benefits of anticoag"}
{"answers": "A significant difference in dental health between recruits to each Service does exist and is a likely to be a reflection of the sociodemographic background from which they are drawn.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a differential in the dental health of new recruits to the British Armed Forces, with Army recruits having a significantly higher prevalence of dental decay and greater treatment resource need compared to Royal Navy and Royal Air Force recruits."}
{"answers": "In light of the large sample size and prior pilot testing of presented images, results suggest that episodic migraineurs do not differentially attend to headache-related facial stimuli. Given modest evidence of attentional biases among chronic headache samples, these findings suggest potential differences in attentional processing between chronic and episodic headache subforms.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no evidence to suggest that episodic migraineurs selectively attend to headache-related visual stimuli. The study found no differences in reaction time latencies to headache-related compared to happy facial stimuli among either the migraine or non-migraine groups."}
{"answers": "Under the conditions of this study, preclerkship (year 2) CPEs strongly predicted medical students at risk for failing a senior CPE. This finding opens the opportunity for remediation of deficits prior to or during clerkships.", "prediction_text": "Yes, students' scores on preclerkship clinical performance examinations can predict that they will fail a senior clinical performance examination. The study found that students who performed poorly on their second-year clinical performance examinations (CPEs) were at a higher risk of failing the senior CPE. Additionally, although USMLE Step 1 scores were weaker predictors of senior CPE performance, they still showed some correlation."}
{"answers": "Our results suggest that people do not attach a simple fixed premium to \"safety-related\" interventions but that preferences depend more subtly on context. The use of the results of such public preference surveys to directly inform policy would therefore be premature.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the public places more value on safety-related health care improvements when the health care system is not responsible for the harm, compared to when it is responsible."}
{"answers": "Minimising the radiation dose to one of the parotid glands with the help of IMRT in patients with advanced head and neck cancers can prevent xerostomia in most patients and parotid scintigraphy is a useful method of documenting xerostomia.", "prediction_text": "No, dose reduction to one parotid gland does not prevent xerostomia in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancers undergoing intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with or without chemotherapy."}
{"answers": "It is important to continue FA supplementation over the long term in patients on methotrexate and FA in order to prevent them discontinuing treatment because of mouth ulcers or nausea and vomiting. Our data suggest that FA supplementation is also helpful in preventing neutropenia, with very little loss of efficacy of methotrexate.", "prediction_text": "No, the study suggests that patients with rheumatoid arthritis established on methotrexate and folic acid supplements do not need to continue folic acid supplements long term. The study found that stopping folic acid supplementation resulted in an increased incidence of nausea in the placebo group, but there was no significant difference in the efficacy of methotrexate between the two groups."}
{"answers": "LF and cruroplasty is feasible and has good results in terms of GERD symptoms control and additional weight loss. The high rate of postoperative complications observed in this series remains a matter of concern. A re-sleeve procedure might be considered as an alternative to RYGB/DS conversion restricted to selected patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, laparoscopic fundectomy (LF) is safe and effective as revision surgery for patients with residual fundus or neofundus after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms. The study found that LF resulted in significant improvements in GERD symptoms and weight loss in both groups, with Group B experiencing an additional 53.4% excess weight loss (EWL) at 24 months compared to Group A. However, there were some postoperative complications, including bleeding, mid-gastric stenosis,"}
{"answers": "VAT area measurement at a single level 3 cm above the lower margin of the L3 vertebra is feasible and can reflect changes in VAT volume and body weight. Advances in knowledge: As VAT area at a CT slice 3cm above the lower margin of L3 can best reflect interval changes in VAT volume and body weight, VAT area measurement should be selected at this location.", "prediction_text": "Yes, visceral adipose tissue area measurement at a single level (specifically, 3 cm above the lower margin of L3) can represent visceral adipose tissue volume changes. The study found a strong correlation between VAT area at this location and both VAT volume and body weight changes."}
{"answers": "Barrett's cytokeratin 7/20 pattern can be a useful marker for the diagnosis of short-segment Barrett's oesophagus, although the false positive or false negative rate is approximately 25%.", "prediction_text": "Yes, cytokeratin immunoreactivity is useful in the diagnosis of short-segment Barrett's oesophagus in Korea. The study found that Barrett's cytokeratin 7/20 pattern was observed in 77.8% of cases with short-segment Barrett's oesophagus, with a sensitivity and specificity of 77.8 and 77.5%, respectively."}
{"answers": "In this paper the effect of lunar phases on the time of delivery is shown. This influence seems to be especially relevant in the case of multiparae and plurigravidae. Nevertheless, it is too weak to allow for prediction regarding the days with the highest frequency of deliveries.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the lunar position influences the time of delivery, with a higher likelihood of delivery occurring around the full moon in multiparae and plurigravidae."}
{"answers": "Financial incentives for smoking cessation in pregnancy are highly cost-effective, with an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life years of \u00a3482, which is well below recommended decision thresholds.", "prediction_text": "Financial incentives for smoking cessation during pregnancy are cost-effective, with an incremental cost per quitter of \u00a31127 ($1716) and an incremental cost-utility ratio (ICER) of \u00a3482/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) based on a life-time Markov model. However, there is uncertainty regarding relapse after birth, and additional research is potentially worthwhile."}
{"answers": "This data demonstrates the robust nature of the short stay ward. At these two very different institutions we have shown improved bed efficient and patient care in a cost-effective way. We have also reported on greater parental satisfaction and early return of the child with their family to the community.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the short stay or 23-hour ward in a general and academic children's hospital is effective in increasing hospital efficiency and reducing costs. The study found that the short stay ward accounted for a significant proportion of admissions (10.3% and 14.7% at Westmead Hospital and the New Children's Hospital, respectively), with a similar admission pattern to the main hospital. The average length of stay in the short stay ward was significantly shorter than in the main hospital, and the rate of patient admission to an in-hospital bed and unscheduled visits within 72 hours of discharge was low. Additionally, there were no adverse events reported,"}
{"answers": "Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery is a safe method of treatment in patients with Cushing's disease. Operative findings, radiological and histological findings, together with early postoperative serum cortisol and urine free cortisol estimates may identify failures in treatment. Alternative treatment might then be required for these patients. Because of the risk of late relapse, patients require life-long follow-up.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that certain factors can predict the outcome of transsphenoidal pituitary surgery in patients with Cushing's disease. These factors include:"}
{"answers": "Patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms have a great diversity of functional somatic symptoms. They use more somatic and psychotropic drugs than controls in the years before diagnosis. Moreover, they show high rates of referrals and psychiatric morbidity. The diversity of symptoms of patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms supports the concept that symptoms do not cluster in well defined distinct syndromes. Therefore, patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms should preferably not be classified into medical subspecialty syndromes.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms did not constitute a single syndrome, but rather a group of distinct subtypes with different characteristics."}
{"answers": "The vast majority of MDT decisions are implemented. Management alteration was most often due to patient choice or additional information available after the MDT. A minority of management alterations were 'unjustifiable' and the authors recommend that any patient whose treatment is subsequently changed should have MDT rediscussion prior to treatment.", "prediction_text": "In this study, 91.5% of multidisciplinary team (MDT) decisions for breast cancer management were found to be concordant with subsequent patient management, while 4.5% were discordant and 4% had no MDT decision. Of the discordant decisions, 26 (17.8%) were considered \"unjustifiable\" as there was no additional information available after the MDT to account for the change in management, while the remaining 120 (92.2%) were considered \"justifiable\" due to patient choice, additional information available after MDT, or MDT error."}
{"answers": "We found that 1.6% of S. aureus (all MSSA) from bacteraemic patients were PVL-positive. This low incidence suggests that PVL-positive S. aureus are of no particular significance as causative agents of S. aureus bacteraemia.", "prediction_text": "Yes, Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL) is associated with the pathogenesis of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia in the UK. Of the 244 S. aureus isolates from bacteraemic patients screened in the study, only four (1.6%) were PVL-positive, but these isolates were associated with infection foci in skin and soft tissue, unknown, indwelling line, and surgical site. Additionally, the four PVL-positive isolates were resistant to penicillin and fusidic acid, but susceptible to all other antibiot"}
{"answers": "These findings are in accordance with previous experimental work and provide additional support for the assertion that dogs can prime autistic children for therapy. Ultimately, this study may contribute toward a change for full acceptance of canine-assisted therapy programs within the medical milieu. Additional studies using a similar research protocol on more autistic children will certainly help professionals to work on the most effective methods to individually serve this population through canine-assisted interventions.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that the presence of a certified therapy dog can prime autistic children for therapy by increasing the frequency and duration of positive behaviors, such as smiling and physical contact, and reducing the frequency and duration of negative behaviors, such as aggression."}
{"answers": "We conclude that increased cardiovascular risk of the DD genotype is not mediated through insulin resistance or abnormalities in fibrinolysis. Conversely, we report an increased sensitivity in NIDDM subjects with the ACE DD genotype.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the insertion allele (I) of the ACE gene I/D polymorphism is associated with insulin resistance in non-insulin-dependent diabetic (NIDDM) subjects."}
{"answers": "A history of PIPE may be a risk factor for the development of IPE. Yet, the disappearance of significance on multivariate analysis indicates that it is not an independent predictor.", "prediction_text": "Yes, postictal psychotic episodes (PIPE) are predictive of the development of interictal psychotic episodes (IPE) in adults with partial seizure disorder. A history of PIPE, male gender, and the presence of bilateral ictal foci were found to be predictive of IPE in univariate logistic regression analyses, but these variables lost significance in a multivariate analysis."}
{"answers": "QTcD is significantly increased in hypertensive patients with LVH compared with those without, being strongly correlated with the indices of LVH. A QTcD cut-off value of 60 ms predicted LVH in hypertensive patients with a high sensitivity and specificity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, corrected QT dispersion (QTcD) can predict left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in hypertensive patients."}

{"answers": "Current K/DOQI guidelines are inadequate for correcting VDDI or secondary hyperparathyroidism in CKD patients. Future studies should examine the effects of higher or more frequent dosing of ergocalciferol on these clinical endpoints.", "prediction_text": "The current K/DOQI treatment guidelines for vitamin D deficiency in CKD patients may not be adequate for correcting vitamin D deficiency and hyperparathyroidism, as only 54% of patients achieved a>or = 5 ng/ml increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin D level and only 26% achieved>or = 30% decrease in intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) level after treatment with ergocalciferol."}
{"answers": "Baseline pain intensity does not predict the outcome after an appropriate opioid titration. It is likely that non-homogeneous pain treatment would have biased the outcome of a previous work.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no correlation found between baseline pain intensity categories and opioid response in cancer patients."}
{"answers": "Maintaining viral load suppression over time in resource-limited-settings is feasible.", "prediction_text": "In resource-limited settings, it is feasible to maintain HIV viral load suppression over time with treatment as prevention (TasP) strategies. The study found that 87.3% of patients had undetectable VL, and only 16.5% experienced virologic failure, with an average of 2.7-fold more failures in patients on third-line ART regimens compared to those on first- or second-line regimens."}
{"answers": "Mucosal redundancy is a constant associated finding in IHPS. Although the origin of the redundancy and a cause-and-effect relationship are difficult to establish, our findings support the hypothesis that hypergastrinemia may be implicated in the pathogenesis of IHPS, and suggest that mucosal thickening could be implicated as one of the initiating factors in its development.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is an etiologic role of pyloric mucosal hypertrophy in the development of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS)."}
{"answers": "Given the available screening technologies, discordant TEOAE and AABR may be inevitable for some categories of hearing loss among apparently healthy newborns whose mothers received prenatal care. The potential limitations of perinatal morbidities as basis of targeted screening for such cases therefore merit further consideration.", "prediction_text": "Yes, discordance in TEOAE and AABR outcomes is predictable in newborns. Maternal and infant factors, such as antenatal care attendance, mode of delivery, and nursery type, can be used to predict the likelihood of discordant outcomes among infants undergoing newborn hearing screening."}
{"answers": "GM of CRC and SLM was associated with fewer procedures but did not influence overall survival. SM was associated with a longer delay and increased use of chemotherapy between procedures, suggesting that more rigorous selection of SM patients for surgery may explain the higher disease-free survival after SLM resection.", "prediction_text": "Global management of colorectal cancer with synchronous liver metastases (SLM) at the same centre may improve outcomes compared to separate management at different centers."}
{"answers": "epiDWI has the potential to differentiate pleomorphic adenoma and myoepithelial adenomas from all other examined entities. Due to an overlap not only within the group of benign and malignant lesions but also between groups, diagnoses should not be addressed on the basis of ADC values solely. Therefore, further studies combining DWI, morphologic criteria, and probably other MR imaging techniques seem warranted.", "prediction_text": "Yes, diffusion-weighted echo-planar MR imaging (epiDWI) can predict different histologic subtypes of primary parotid gland tumors. The study found that the apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) of pleomorphic adenomas were significantly higher than those of other entities, except for myoepithelial adenomas. Additionally, ADC values of Warthin tumors were different from those of myoepithelial adenomas, lipomas, and salivary duct carcinomas. However, mucoepidermoid carcinomas, acinic cell carcinomas, and basal cell adenocarcinomas could not be differenti"}
{"answers": "The survey shows significant dissatisfaction amongst consultant radiologists with the current service, confirms a low number of paediatric radiologists taking on this work, and suggests the potential to increase numbers of radiology child abuse experts by 27% if given improved training and support. Appropriate service and education strategies should be implemented.", "prediction_text": "No, UK radiologists are not satisfied with the training and support received in suspected child abuse. Only 61% of respondents thought that the service could be improved, and 73% would never consider providing expert evidence, even if given adequate radiology and/or legal training."}
{"answers": "The enhancement of serum TNFalpha and IL-6 levels in the patients with ERCP-induced pancreatitis reflects the inflammatory activity. Additionally, these cytokines together with IL-4 can be used in clinical laboratory monitoring of ERCP.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the changes in the serum levels of IL-2, IL-4, TNFalpha, and IL-6 reflect the inflammatory activity in the patients with post-ERCP pancreatitis. The study found that the levels of IL-4 at 24 hours after ERCP were significantly lower in the patients with post-ERCP pancreatitis, while the levels of TNFalpha at 12 hours after ERCP were higher in the complicated group than those of the uncomplicated group. Additionally, the ratios of TNFalpha/IL-4 at 12 and 24 hours after ERCP were found significantly higher in the patients with post-ERCP pancre"}
{"answers": "During the 5 years, 24% of Africans with optimal BP developed hypertension. The surge in hypertension in Africa is largely explained by modifiable risk factors. Public health strategies should focus aggressively on lifestyle to prevent a catastrophic burden on the national health system.", "prediction_text": "Yes, behavioral risk factors such as smoking, waist circumference, and alcohol intake are significant predictors of the conversion from optimal blood pressure to hypertensive status in Black South Africans."}
{"answers": "Our data have revealed a number of differences. Compared to the clinic sample, the Web-based sample had worse psychological symptom burden, younger average age, higher prevalence of employment, and a lower proportion on ART. For future research, we recommend that Web-based data collection should include the demographic variables that we note differed between samples. In addition, we recognize that each recruitment method may bring inherent sampling bias, with clinic populations differing by geographical location and reflecting those accessing regular medical care, and Web-based sampling recruiting those with greater Internet access and identifying survey materials through specific searches and contact with specific websites.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that Web-based and clinic samples of gay men living with HIV differ on self-reported physical and psychological symptoms. Specifically, the Web-based sample reported higher levels of psychological symptom burden compared to the clinic sample, and those recruited via the Web were more likely to report being in the upper (worst) tertile of psychological symptom burden. In contrast, the Web-based sample did not differ significantly from the clinic sample in terms of physical symptom burden. Additionally, employment status was found to be a significant predictor of physical symptom burden, with those in employment being less likely to report being in the upper ("}
{"answers": "The majority of acetabular components in this cohort were stable despite the small contact surface achieved between the component and pelvic bone. Three of 10 migrated in excess of the limits that predict later loosening in primary THA but it remains to be seen whether these limits apply to this selected group of frail osteoporotic patients. We continue to use this technique routinely to treat patients with the same indications, but since the analysis of these data we have added screw fixation of the acetabular component to the ischial tuberosity and the superior pubic ramus.", "prediction_text": "The study found that cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups does not provide initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures. At 1 year postoperatively, three of the 10 components had migration above the suggested limits for primary THA, indicating a lack of initial stability. Additionally, the contact surface achieved between the acetabular component and pelvis was found to be variable, with a range of 11 to 17 cm(2) (15%-27% of each component). These findings suggest that cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups may not be effective in providing initial stability in THA for o"}
{"answers": "Despite high perioperative mortality, results document a sustainable recovery of the survivors offering the prospect of a highly independent and satisfying life. Therefore, advanced age alone should not be a contraindication for redo cardiac interventions. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2016; 16: 1138-1144.", "prediction_text": "Cardiac reoperations in octogenarians (patients aged 80 years or older) can be beneficial in improving functional status and quality of life, as evidenced by the improvement in Barthel Index scores and New York Heart Association class. However, the mortality rate after cardiac reoperation in this age group is relatively high, with 32.1% of patients dying during hospital stay and an additional 19.0% dying during follow-up. Despite these findings, the majority of patients (93%) were able to return home after surgery, and summary scores of physical and mental health on the short form-12 questionnaire were similar to those of age- and sex"}
{"answers": "Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (ie, SMI) were more likely than other patients to be admitted to nursing homes with higher deficiency citations for both overall quality and clinical care quality. Further research is necessary to understand the reasons behind the disparity in quality of nursing home care associated with SMI.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patients with serious mental illness (SMI) are more likely to be admitted to nursing homes with more deficiencies in care compared to other patients. Specifically, patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder tend to enter nursing homes with higher levels of total and healthcare-related deficiencies."}
{"answers": "Patients undergoing open access procedures are less likely to be properly informed about their endoscopic procedure. Our results indicate that with open access endoscopy, a defined mechanism needs to be in place for communication of endoscopic results to the patient.", "prediction_text": "Yes, open access endoscopy may lead to inadequate informed consent and procedure acceptance, as patients in the open access group reported receiving less information and explanation concerning the nature of the procedure compared to the group referred from a gastrointestinal (GI) subspecialty clinic."}
{"answers": "Contrary to common belief, we found that uterine myomas commonly decrease in volume over the course of pregnancy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, uterine myomas tend to grow during pregnancy, with a significant percentage of them increasing in size between the first and second trimesters, and a smaller percentage decreasing in size between the second and third trimesters."}
{"answers": "We found that all of the studied dimensions of restricted fetal growth are independently associated with increased risks of low intellectual performance and that these associations are only partly mediated by socioeconomic or familial factors.", "prediction_text": "The associations between birth characteristics (birth weight, small for gestational age, and small head circumference) and low intellectual performance in early adulthood are not significantly confounded by socioeconomic factors in adolescence or familial effects."}
{"answers": "Although feasible, double reading of barium enemas does not improve sensitivity for detection of polyps and produces a higher false-positive rate.", "prediction_text": "Double reading of barium enemas is not necessary as it does not improve the detection of lesions or alter clinical treatment in most patients. Adding a second reader resulted in a small increase in the number of positive results, but the specificity decreased and the overall agreement between the first and combined readings was lower. The second reading also required an additional 3.3 minutes. However, double reading of barium enemas may be useful for the detection of adenocarcinomas, with a sensitivity of 100%."}
{"answers": "The VMPA can provide direct access and favorable visibility to the TMJ region and yield good esthetic and functional results. The VMPA can be considered the approach of choice for common TMJ surgeries.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the vascular-guided multilayer preauricular approach (VMPA) to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) can improve access and reduce complications compared to traditional TMJ surgeries."}
{"answers": "The metastasis rate of station 9 lymph nodes was significantly lower than other mediastinal stations in lung cancer patients. The metastasis status of station 9 had no significant influence on tumor staging or prognosis. Routine dissection of station 9 lymph nodes may not be necessary, especially in patients with a low T stage, upper or middle lobe tumors, or without intrapulmonary lymph node metastasis.", "prediction_text": "Routine dissection of station 9 lymph nodes is not necessary for primary lung cancer surgery, as the metastasis rate of this station is significantly lower than other mediastinal stations and does not significantly impact prognosis."}
{"answers": "During the time period considered, the FDA AED-related suicidality warning does not appear to have significantly affected prescription claims of AED medications for the study population.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no significant change in the trend of antiepileptic drug (AED) prescription claims among members with epilepsy and/or psychiatric disorder following the FDA suicidality warning."}
{"answers": "In our population of stroke survivors, self-reports of motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions differed from government records. In future studies, the use of both government and self-reported data would ensure a more accurate picture of driving safety post-stroke.", "prediction_text": "The agreement between government records (Department of Transportation) and self-reported data on motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions for stroke survivors is moderate, with a kappa coefficient of 0.52 for collisions and 0.47 for convictions. When both sources of data are consulted, up to 56% more accidents and up to 46% more convictions are identified in the study population in the 5 years before study entry compared to when either source is used alone."}
{"answers": "The realized communication skills courses resulted in relevant changes in communication behaviour and self-confidence of participants. Communication with terminally ill patients can be taught.", "prediction_text": "Yes, communication with terminally ill patients can be taught through a structured course model. The study found that participants' communication behavior improved after participating in a 2-day course, with increased sense of security in different communication settings and reported changes in communication behavior 3 months after the course."}
{"answers": "For conditions with a well-developed quality of care evidence base, such as hypertension and diabetes, a single structured implicit review to assess the quality of care over a period of time is moderately reliable. This method could be a reasonable complement or alternative to explicit indicator approaches for assessing and comparing quality of care. Structured implicit review, like explicit quality measures, must be used more cautiously for illnesses for which the evidence base is less well developed, such as COPD and acute, short-course illnesses.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a role for peer review in profiling quality of care, particularly for conditions with a well-established evidence base. In this study, the reliability of implicit review was higher for diabetes and hypertension compared to less developed conditions such as COPD and a collection of acute conditions. This suggests that peer review can provide a more accurate assessment of quality of care for conditions with a strong evidence base, and may be a useful tool for identifying areas for improvement in these conditions."}
{"answers": "The high rate of unsuccessful IUD insertions reported here, particularly for nulliparous women, suggests that the true insertion failure rate of providers who are not employing additional tools for difficult insertions may be much higher than reported in clinical trials. Further investigation is necessary to determine if this is a common problem and, if so, to assess if the use of adjuvant measures will reduce the number of unsuccessful IUD insertions.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that failed IUD insertions are an under-recognized problem in community practice, particularly among nulliparous women. The study found that 19.6% of IUD insertions among nulliparous women were unsuccessful, compared to 13.6% among parous women. The adjusted odds ratio showed that IUD insertion failure was more likely in nulliparous women compared to parous women. These findings suggest that there may be a need for additional training or support for providers in inserting IUDs in this population."}
{"answers": "Even in capped health care systems, virtual planning and guided surgery including prebent or milled plates are financially viable.", "prediction_text": "Yes, virtual planning and guided surgery for head and neck reconstruction are economically viable. The study found that the additional cost of virtual planning was reduced by $4,066.50 and $5,867.00 for prebent and milled plates, respectively, due to the time saved during surgery."}
{"answers": "Bipolarity does not independently influence risk of suicidal behavior or alter the influence of well-established suicide risk factors within affective disorders. Suicide risk assessment strategies may continue to appraise these common risk factors without regard to mood polarity.", "prediction_text": "No, risk factors for suicidal behavior do not differ by affective disorder polarity."}
{"answers": "The administration of polyvalent Crotalidae antivenin is safe. Acute hypersensitivity, when it occurs, consists solely in most cases of urticaria. Serious side effects are uncommon.", "prediction_text": "No, the aggressive use of polyvalent antivenin for rattlesnake bites does not result in serious acute side effects, such as death, amputations, or permanent disability, in the studied population. However, a minority of patients (18%) experienced acute side effects within the first 6 hours after administration, consisting mainly of urticaria."}
{"answers": "Although endomyocardial fibrosis patients have improved clinical symptoms after surgery, the global left ventricular ejection fraction and regional wall motion in these patients do not change. This finding suggests that other explanations, such as improvements in diastolic function, may be operational.", "prediction_text": "No, quantitative left ventricular regional wall motion does not change after fibrous tissue resection in endomyocardial fibrosis."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrates that laser pretreatment significantly increases absorption of topical lidocaine so that it is detectable in the blood and that manipulating laser settings can affect drug absorption. Future work will look at translating this effect into clinical benefit.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that fractional lasers can enhance transdermal absorption of topical lidocaine in an in vivo animal model. The peak levels of lidocaine were significantly higher at 250 \u00b5m ablative depth, compared to other laser settings, and the peak levels of its metabolite monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) were significantly higher at the same depth."}
{"answers": "Vaccines were exposed to temperatures that may reduce their potency. Safe storage of vaccines in the clinics cannot be ensured without adhering to the recommended guidelines. Provision of adequate equipment and training for staff in maintaining the \"cold chain\" and the use and care of equipment are important components of a successful immunisation programme.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that there is a weak link in the cold chain for the storage of vaccines in the community. Only 16 of the 40 general practices surveyed were aware of the appropriate storage conditions for vaccines, and only one of the eight practices selected for refrigeration monitoring had a daily temperature monitoring system in place. Additionally, vaccines were exposed to subzero temperatures or temperatures up to 16\u00b0C in six of the eight practices monitored, which is not in compliance with Department of Health guidelines."}
{"answers": "p53 alteration detected by IHC or SSCP analysis is not a clinically useful predictor of local response to pre-operative adjuvant therapy in advanced rectal carcinoma.", "prediction_text": "No, p53 alterations cannot be used to predict tumour response to pre-operative chemo-radiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer."}
{"answers": "The results of this study cast doubt on the suggested advantage of HBO in reducing patient mortality and morbidity when used as adjuvant therapy for NF.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) therapy may be an indication for the treatment of necrotizing fasciitis (NF). The mortality rate among patients who received HBO as part of their treatment protocol was lower than among those who did not receive HBO, and the mean number of surgical d\u00e9bridements required per patient was significantly higher in the HBO group. However, the study did not find a significant difference in the average length of hospitalization for survivors between the two groups."}
{"answers": "High doses of ZNS are effective and safe in pharmacoresistant epileptic patients. Therapeutic drug monitoring of ZNS may be considered at therapeutic failure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, high doses of zonisamide (>500 mg/d) may be effective and well-tolerated in adult patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy, with a response rate of 55% and good tolerance in 66% of patients."}
{"answers": "In conclusion, high Ki-67 expression was associated with poor survival in patients with UTUC, as well as a high risk of disease progression, although these findings need to be interpreted with caution. Large-scale, adequately designed, prospective trials are needed to further confirm the value of Ki-67 in prognosis of UTUC patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, overexpression of Ki-67 is a prognostic biomarker of upper tract urinary carcinoma (UTUC). The study found that high Ki-67 expression was associated with poorer cancer-specific survival (CSS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in UTUC patients, and this association was confirmed in a meta-analysis of published literature. The pooled hazard ratio (HR) estimates for CSS and DFS were 3.196 and 3.517, respectively, indicating that overexpression of Ki-67 is a significant predictor of poor prognosis in UTUC patients. Additionally, the subgroup analysis showed that"}
{"answers": "After comparing MR with arthroscopic findings and reviewing the available literature, we conclude that arthroscopy permits the direct visualization of even fine articular surface changes but does not depict the subchondral bone, the most frequent site of injury detected with MRI. MRI was a very useful tool in the detection and characterization of the different types of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries and showed a statistically significant correlation between site and distribution of bone and cartilage injuries and between internal damage and trauma mechanisms. Therefore, we believe that MRI can help avoid diagnostic arthroscopy in the patients with a history of post-traumatic pain, acute articular blocks and negative radiographic findings.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used as an alternative to diagnostic arthroscopy for the detection and characterization of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries in the knee. The study found that MRI was able to identify 45 osteochondral and 19 chondral injuries that were missed by conventional radiography and arthroscopy. The study also found that MRI was able to differentiate between bone bruises, subchondral injuries, and osteochondral injuries based on their morphological and signal intensity patterns. However, the study also noted that arthroscopy was still necessary"}
{"answers": "The prevalence of cognitive impairment in MND in this population based study of an unselected cohort was higher than has been previously reported. Language deficits, especially anomia, may be relatively frequent in the MND population. Aphasia in MND may be masked by dysarthria and missed if not specifically examined.", "prediction_text": "Yes, dementia and aphasia are underrecognized associations in motor neuron disease."}
{"answers": "Postoperative numbness occurs in most patients receiving nasal microfat injections. Partial to complete recovery of nasal tip sensation can be expected to occur over a 3-month period.", "prediction_text": "Yes, sensation gradually returns to the nasal tip after microfat grafting, with a mean recovery time of 1.51 units at week 2, 2.39 units at week 4, 3.01 units at week 8, and 3.35 units at week 12."}
{"answers": "Conveyance of emotions or movements through music may be decoded differently by persons with different types of communication disorders. Because music is the primary therapeutic tool in music therapy sessions, clinicians should consider these differential abilities when selecting music for clinical interventions focusing on emotions or movement.", "prediction_text": "Yes, communication disorders can extend to musical messages. The study found that children with severe to profound hearing loss (using cochlear implants) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) had difficulty recognizing emotions or movements in music, and were less accurate than children with typical development and normal hearing (TD-NH) in identifying musical emotions or movements."}
{"answers": "For some patients, using colour to describe their pain experience may be a useful tool to improve doctor-patient communication.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patients with knee osteoarthritis can use colour to describe their pain. The majority of participants in the study found the idea of using colour to be generally acceptable and were able to associate their pain with specific colours. They used red to describe high-intensity pain and colours such as purity, calmness, and happiness to describe the absence of pain. Participants also identified specific colours to represent changes in pain intensity, such as grey or black for aching pain and a wider selection of colours for sharp pain. While some issues around interpretability and standardization of colour were raised, the majority of participants thought they could use colour to describe their pain to healthcare professionals."}
{"answers": "It appears safe to administer intensive chemotherapy regimens at standard doses to rural patients without increased morbidity or mortality. Support for general practitioners through phone or videoconferencing may reduce the safety concerns.", "prediction_text": "Yes, intensive chemotherapy is safe for rural cancer patients. The study found no significant differences in the rate of serious adverse events, such as febrile neutropenia, diarrhea, and vomiting, between urban and rural patients receiving chemotherapy at the Townsville Cancer Centre. Additionally, there were no toxic deaths in either group."}
{"answers": "Although outcomes for EPSCC remains poor, both surgery and radiation is shown to significantly improve median, 5- and 10-year survival rates. EPSCC patients who are potential candidates for surgical resection or radiation therapy may benefit from these treatments.", "prediction_text": "Yes, surgery and radiation therapy have a significant impact on survival for patients with extrapulmonary small cell cancers."}
{"answers": "DGE after PPPD seems to be of minor clinical importance following uncomplicated surgery. When taking the results into consideration, it can be said that, despite the lack of a control group, antecolic duodenojejunostomy might be the key to a low incidence of DGE after PPPD. In our experience, DGE is linked to the occurrence of other postoperative complications rather than to pylorus preservation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the incidence of delayed gastric emptying (DGE) after pancreaticoduodenectomy is related to pylorus preservation. In the study, patients who underwent an antecolic duodenojejunostomy had a lower incidence of DGE compared to those who underwent a retrocolic duodenojejunostomy."}
{"answers": "In women with POP, the symptom of pelvic pain is associated with the presence of defecatory symptoms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, pelvic pain is associated with defecatory symptoms in women with pelvic organ prolapse (POP). The study found that women with pelvic pain are more likely to experience straining with bowel movement, sense of incomplete emptying, pain with bowel movement, and splinting with bowel movement compared to those without pelvic pain."}
{"answers": "The results confirm that c-kit is vastly expressed in uveal melanoma, suggest that the c-kit molecular pathway may be important in uveal melanoma growth, and point to its use as a target for therapy with STI571.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the expression and phosphorylation of c-kit in uveal melanoma cells suggest that it may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of uveal melanoma. The study found that c-kit is strongly expressed and tyrosine phosphorylated in cultured uveal melanoma cells compared to cutaneous melanoma cells, and that treatment with the c-kit inhibitor STI571 resulted in cell death in uveal melanoma cell lines. The IC(50) of the inhibitory effects on c-kit phosphorylation and cell proliferation was found to be less than 2.5 micro"}
{"answers": "Results suggest that telmisartan may reduce type-I diabetes mellitus-induced hepatic injury by suppressing activated hepatic stellate cells through concomitant TGF-beta1 down-regulation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, telmisartan prevents hepatic fibrosis in rats with alloxan-induced diabetes. The study found a significant difference in the numerical density of hepatocytes between the diabetic control group and the diabetic rats treated with telmisartan, suggesting that telmisartan may have protective effects against hepatic degeneration. Additionally, the study found no immunoreactivity of TGF-beta in the liver sections of the diabetic rats treated with telmisartan, indicating that telmisartan may inhibit the expression of TGF-beta, a key factor in hepatic fibrosis."}
{"answers": "The great majority of U.S. renal transplant centers will not transplant kidneys to HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease, even if their infection is asymptomatic. However, advances in the management of HIV infection and a review of relevant ethical issues suggest that this approach should be reconsidered.", "prediction_text": "No, according to the survey, the majority of U.S. transplant centers do not support excluding all HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease from transplantation. While the majority of centers require HIV testing of prospective kidney recipients and would not transplant an individual who refuses testing, some centers would consider transplanting an HIV-infected patient who is otherwise a good candidate for transplantation."}
{"answers": "The overall yield of SL for HCC was 7 %, and the accuracy was 27 %. When accurate imaging methods are available and additional percutaneous liver biopsy is implemented as a standard procedure in the preoperative workup of patients with HCC, the benefit of SL will become even less.", "prediction_text": "Staging laparoscopy (SL) for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is useful in detecting unresectable tumors or metastases with an overall yield of 7% and accuracy of 27%."}
{"answers": "Expert breast pathology assessments continue to be necessary in the management of DCIS.", "prediction_text": "Yes, expert breast pathology assessment is necessary for the management of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The study found that secondary pathology assessments led to a change in the assessment of local recurrence risk in 29% and contributed to a change in treatment recommendation in 43% of cases, highlighting the importance of expert breast pathology assessment in accurately evaluating the severity of DCIS and guiding management decisions."}
{"answers": "Vaginal pH should be measured by bringing the pH strip in direct contact with fresh vaginal fluid without first adding saline.", "prediction_text": "No, vaginal pH cannot be accurately measured from wet mount slides due to systematic increases in pH caused by the addition of saline, leading to false positive readings."}
{"answers": "This study presents a different clinical picture of oral mucoceles/ranulas, as observed in HIV-positive patients. Additionally, it suggests a possible clinical link between the two pathologies. The authors strongly support the suggestion that oral mucocele/ranula is an HIV-related salivary gland disease.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that oral mucocele/ranula is another HIV-related salivary gland disease. The study found that 72 out of 113 (63.7%) patients with oral mucocele/ranula were HIV positive, and 97.2% of these patients had ranulas. In contrast, only 2 patients out of 83 (2.4%) HIV-negative patients had plunging ranulas. These findings suggest that HIV infection is a significant risk factor for the development of oral mucocele/ranula, and that HIV-positive patients are more likely to present with both simple"}
{"answers": "There are no data to support the widespread practice of using central venous pressure to guide fluid therapy. This approach to fluid resuscitation should be abandoned.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the central venous pressure (CVP) predicts fluid responsiveness in adult patients, with a summary area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.56 (95% CI, 0.54-0.58) across all studies. This means that CVP can be used to identify patients who are likely to respond to fluid administration, with a sensitivity of 57% \u00b1 13% and a specificity of 73% \u00b1 10%. The AUC was higher in intensive care unit (ICU) patients (0.56, 95% CI, 0.52-0.58) than"}
{"answers": "Increased D-dimer levels should not be considered as a diagnostic parameter in diagnosis of acute appendicitis.", "prediction_text": "No, D-dimer cannot be used as a diagnostic parameter for acute appendicitis. The study found no statistically significant difference in D-dimer levels between histopathologic study groups, and the ratio of cases with a number of leukocytes below the upper limit was also not significantly different between groups."}
{"answers": "Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mitochondria play a role in remodeling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death (PCD). The study found that mitochondrial dynamics, including distribution, motility, and membrane potential, change during PCD in the lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis). The mitochondrial dye MitoTracker Red CMXRos was used to visualize mitochondrial structures in live cells, and a TUNEL assay was used to detect fragmented nuclear DNA in a gradient over these mitochondrial stages. The results showed that mitochondrial dynamics change during PCD, with mitochondria transitioning from stage M1 ("}
{"answers": "Our study emphasised the discomfort of transurethral urinary catheters, especially in male patients, and the high incidence of urinary tract infections in both sexes. Consideration should be given to the utilisation of alternative methods of bladder drainage, such as suprapubic catheterisation, which can be performed with ease during laparotomy.", "prediction_text": "No, transurethral catheterisation is not the ideal method of bladder drainage according to the study, as it is associated with discomfort and a higher incidence of urinary tract infections. Male patients in particular were found to be less satisfied with the procedure and experienced more pain during catheter insertion and removal."}
{"answers": "Based on this pilot data, MASCC score appears promising in determining suitability for outpatient management of NF in gynecologic oncology patients. Prospective study is ongoing to confirm safety and determine impact on cost.", "prediction_text": "Risk stratification using the Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) index score is useful for predicting severe complications and mortality in gynecologic oncology patients with neutropenic fever (NF). Low-risk patients (MASCC score \u2265 21) are less likely to experience severe complications and mortality, while high-risk patients (MASCC score < 21) are more likely to experience these outcomes. Inpatient management may be more appropriate for high-risk patients, while outpatient management may be feasible for low-risk patients."}
{"answers": "Halofantrine has mild to moderate pathological effects on cochlea histology, and can be considered an ototoxic drug.", "prediction_text": "Yes, halofantrine is ototoxic. The study found that the drug caused loss and distortion of inner hair cells, inner phalangeal cells, and spiral ganglia cells in guinea pigs."}
{"answers": "Proportionally fewer elderly patients with OPSCC are being treated than younger individuals. These patients can have significant benefits from aggressive treatments despite their older age as shown by our survival analysis. We recommend the use of objective measures to assess patient fitness to reduce the potential for undertreatment in the elderly population.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that elderly patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) are undertreated, particularly those aged 65-74 and 75-84 years. The analysis showed that these age groups had substantial benefits in disease-specific survival (DSS) with surgery, radiation, or combined therapy compared to younger age groups. However, multivariate analysis did not demonstrate any statistically significant difference in the hazard ratios for combined treatment among the age groups."}
{"answers": "Minimal access surgery for the repair of esophageal atresia or congenital diaphragmatic hernia is not associated with less cumulative opioid doses.", "prediction_text": "No, minimal access major surgery in newborns does not hurt less than conventional surgery. The study found that the cumulative opioid doses at 12, 24, 48 hours and 7 days postoperatively were not significantly different between the minimal access surgery group and the control group for both congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) and esophageal atresia (EA) patients."}
{"answers": "Clinical predictors appear inadequate for the evaluation of the cervical spine in geriatric trauma patients with low-energy mechanism.", "prediction_text": "No, clinical predictors are not adequate in identifying cervical spine fractures in geriatric blunt trauma patients with low-energy mechanism."}
{"answers": "European individuals with type 1 diabetes consume a high atherogenic diet as few patients met recommendations for dietary fibre and saturated fat. This study showed minor changes in dietary nutrients and energy intakes over a period of 7 years. Nutrition education needs particular focus on strategies to increase dietary fibre and reduce saturated fat to exploit their potential benefit.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that individuals with type 1 diabetes in Europe do not consume a high atherogenic diet. The study found that there were minor changes in nutrient intakes over time, with some reductions in saturated fat and cholesterol intakes, but no significant increases in atherogenic nutrients such as carbohydrates and fibre. While there were some variations in adherence to European nutritional recommendations, the overall dietary pattern was not found to be atherogenic."}
{"answers": "The gaps in patella eversion demonstrated smaller gaps both in knee extension and flexion position compared to the gaps of patella reduction position. The amount of decreased gaps was more definite in knee flexion position. Therefore, the intraoperative patellar positioning has influence on the measurement of the joint gap. Keeping the patella in reduced position is important during gap balancing.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patella position significantly influences ligament balancing in total knee arthroplasty. The study found that the gaps in patella eversion were smaller than those in patella reduction in both knee extension and flexion positions, with a more definite decrease in gaps in knee flexion position. Additionally, there was a statistically significant difference in the lateral gap of patella eversion compared to the gap of patella reduction in knee flexion position (p<0.05). The study suggests that patella position may play a role in ligament balancing during total knee arthroplasty."}
{"answers": "We have thus provided compelling evidence that there is a mossy fiber GABAergic signal. The physiologic role of this mossy fiber GABAergic signal is uncertain, but may be of developmental importance. Other evidence suggests that this GABAergic signal is transiently upregulated after seizures. This could have an inhibitory or disinhibitory effect, and further work is needed to elucidate its actual role.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mossy fibers release GABA. The study found that mossy fiber terminals show intense immunoreactivity for GABA and GAD67, and electrical stimuli that recruit dentate granule cells elicit monosynaptic GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic signals in CA3 pyramidal neurons."}
{"answers": "Men and women in this community sample reported similar patterns of depressive symptoms. No evidence that the presentation of depressive symptoms differs by gender was found.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that there were no significant gender differences in the self-report of depression symptoms after adjusting for potential confounding variables."}

{"answers": "Our findings reveal a significant decrease in ADMA levels of ex-ELBW subjects compared to C, underlining a probable correlation with preterm birth and low birth weight. Taken together, these results may underlie the onset of early circulatory dysfunction predictive of increased cardiovascular risk.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that ADMA levels in young adults born preterm were significantly lower than in healthy adults born at term, and were inversely correlated with gestational age and birth weight. These findings suggest that ADMA levels in young adults born preterm may predict early endothelial dysfunction."}
{"answers": "ECL assays improved the ability to predict time to diabetes in these autoantibody-positive relatives at risk for developing diabetes. These findings might be helpful in the design and eligibility criteria for prevention trials in the future.", "prediction_text": "Yes, electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assays can improve the prediction of time to type 1 diabetes in autoantibody-positive TrialNet subjects. The study found that subjects who were positive for ECL-GADA and/or ECL-IAA had a significantly higher risk of developing diabetes compared to those who were negative for these autoantibodies. Additionally, adding ECL positivity to the Diabetes Prevention Trial risk score (DPTRS) improved the accuracy of predicting time to diabetes, as evidenced by a higher area under the curve (AUC) and a significant increase in the receiver operating characteristic curves."}
{"answers": "These findings indicate that a relationship between multiple sclerosis and streptococcal infections may exist, but to acquire a better understanding of the role of group A streptococci in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, more studies with animal models are necessary.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant relationship between streptococcal infection and multiple sclerosis (MS). The study found that patients with MS had higher levels of antideoxyribonuclease B (ADNase B) compared to healthy controls, indicating a possible association between streptococcal infection and the development of MS."}
{"answers": "Aplastic anemia is associated with a variety of autoimmune syndromes. The sequence of events in our patient suggests that the hepatic failure, AFOP, and the VSAA may all have been part of an autoimmune syndrome. AFOP could be the result of immune dysregulation in this pediatric case with favorable outcome after immunosuppressive therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the authors of the study suggest that acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP) in children may be an expression of immune dysregulation, as all reported cases in children have been fatal and the patient in this study responded to immunosuppressive therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation."}
{"answers": "Rescue AC may apply to only 18% of cases, and we identified subsets of more likely candidates.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the duration of continuing pregnancy after antenatal corticosteroid (AC) administration is variable and depends on various factors, including the reason for receiving AC. Women who received AC for premature preterm rupture of membranes, twins, or before 28 weeks had a lower likelihood of delivering at 34 weeks or later. However, only 17.9% of women remained pregnant for more than one week after AC, suggesting limited opportunity for rescue AC."}
{"answers": "The results show that fatigue in patients with pSS and sSS is not due to the coexistence of FM in most cases. A lower incidence in the United Kingdom of FM in patients with pSS was found than has been previously reported.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant link between fatigue and fibromyalgia (FM) in patients with primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (pSS). The study found that 68% of patients with pSS reported fatigue, which is a significantly higher prevalence than in the lupus group (50%). Additionally, none of the patients with SLE/sSS had FM, while 12% of patients with pSS had FM. These findings suggest that there is a link between fatigue and FM in patients with pSS."}
{"answers": "UDR provides an objective measurement of VUR and appears as a predictive tool of success after endoscopic injection.", "prediction_text": "Yes, distal ureteral diameter (UD) can predict reflux resolution after endoscopic injection in children with primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). In this study, the UD and the UD ratio (UDR) were significant predictors of reflux resolution on logistic regression analysis."}
{"answers": ": Data from both association and expression studies suggested that variants at HINT1 may be associated with schizophrenia and the associations may be sex-specific. However, the markers showing associations were in high LD to the SPEC2/PDZ-GEF2/ACSL6 locus reported previously in the same samples. This made it difficult to separate the association signals amongst these genes. Other independent studies may be necessary to distinguish these candidate genes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1) gene is a candidate for schizophrenia. The study found nominally significant differences in allele frequencies in several SNPs around the HINT1 gene region in both the Irish study of high density schizophrenia families (ISHDSF) and the Irish case control study of schizophrenia (ICCSS), with a sex effect that differed between the two samples. Additionally, significant interactions amongst sex, diagnosis, and rs3864283 genotypes were observed in expression studies. These findings suggest that HINT1 may play a role in the development of schizop"}
{"answers": "Out of the four sacral sparing criteria, the acute phase anal sensory score measurements do not contribute significantly to the prognosis of independent ambulation. The combination of the acute phase voluntary anal contraction and the S4-5 LT and PP scores, predicts significantly better chronic phase-independent ambulation outcomes than the currently used distinction between complete and incomplete SCI.", "prediction_text": "No, the determination between complete and incomplete traumatic spinal cord injury is not clinically relevant for predicting independent ambulation at 1 year post-injury."}
{"answers": "These findings suggest that schizophrenia is associated with progressive structural brain abnormalities, affecting both gray and white matter. We found no evidence to suggest progressive medial temporal lobe involvement but did find evidence that this may be partly explained by heterogeneity between studies in patient age and illness duration. The causes and clinical correlates of these progressive brain changes should now be the focus of investigation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there are progressive brain changes in schizophrenia. The study found that patients with schizophrenia showed significantly greater decreases in whole brain volume, gray matter volume, and white matter volume over time, compared to healthy control subjects. The time between baseline and follow-up scans ranged from 1 to 10 years, and the differences between patients and control subjects in annualized percentage volume change were significant."}
{"answers": "The elevated risk of death after CABG surgery known previously to be associated with CDM seems also to be shared by a group of similar size that includes patients with IFG and undiagnosed DM.", "prediction_text": "Yes, even impaired fasting blood glucose levels (IFG) below the diagnostic threshold for diabetes mellitus (DM) are associated with increased mortality after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. The study found that patients with IFG had a higher risk of 30-day and 1-year mortality compared to those with normal fasting blood glucose levels."}
{"answers": "This is the first known report of concurrent plasma and ISF concentrations of a meropenem antibiotic during CVVHDF. We observed that the ISF concentrations of meropenem were significantly lower than the plasma concentrations, although the present dose was appropriate for infections caused by intermediately susceptible pathogens (MIC\u22644 mg/L).", "prediction_text": "Yes, interstitial fluid (ISF) concentrations of meropenem in critically ill patients receiving continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) are equivalent to plasma concentrations. The study found that ISF and plasma peak concentrations were comparable, with a median ratio of 0.63 (IQR 0.55-0.73) and 0.69 (0.65-0.74) during Profiles A and B, respectively. Additionally, the ISF trough concentrations increased by approximately 40% during Profile B. These findings suggest that ISF concentrations can be used as a surrog"}
{"answers": "Despite advances in early diagnosis and surgical technique, 5-year survival of stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma remains low as compared to survival of other solid organ neoplasm. Tumour size<or=3cm, adenocarcinoma histologic type and negative bronchial resection margins were associated with a more favourable outcome in our patient population. More effective multimodality treatments are needed to increase survival rates.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that Stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma may not be as early a stage as previously thought. The prognostic factors identified in the study, such as histology, tumor size, and negative resection margin, suggest that some patients with Stage I disease may have more advanced disease than expected. The 5-year survival rate for patients with Stage I disease was 63%, which is lower than expected for early-stage cancer."}
{"answers": "There is a knowledge deficit regarding the SU treatment goal among gout patients receiving ULT, despite generally high levels of other gout-specific knowledge. SU goal information may be an important and underutilized concept among providers treating gout patients.", "prediction_text": "Only 14% of gout patients knew their target serum urate (SU) goal, while the majority answered correctly for the other 5 gout-specific knowledge questions. Having a rheumatologist as initial prescriber and knowing all of the other 5 gout-specific knowledge questions were associated with greater odds of knowing the SU goal."}
{"answers": "Despite government assistance, low-income individuals use vision care services less often than wealthy individuals.", "prediction_text": "Yes, government-funded low-income vision care programs improve utilization of eye care services by low-income individuals. Compared to those without financial difficulty, middle-aged whites who self-reported not having glaucoma, cataracts, diabetes, or vision problems not corrected by lenses had a 32% higher utilization of eye care providers among those with financial difficulty, giving a prevalence ratio of 0.68 (95% CI 0.57-0.80) after adjusting for age, sex, and education."}
{"answers": "Premature births from rural mothers have a higher risk of stillbirth and mortality in neonatal intensive care than urban infants.", "prediction_text": "Yes, rural residence is associated with poorer outcomes in premature infants, including higher mortality and stillbirth rates, compared to urban residence in the state of New South Wales (NSW) and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT)."}
{"answers": "Altered ET-1 levels may be involved in the pathogenesis of rebound hypertension and hypotension during HD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that endothelin-1 (ET-1) plays a role in the hemodynamic changes during hemodialysis (HD). Intradialytic changes in ET-1 levels were found to be associated with the severity of hemodynamic changes during HD. Specifically, the post-dialysis ET-1 levels were significantly lower in patients with stable intradialytic hemodynamics (group I) compared to those with dialysis-induced hypotension (group II) or rebound hypertension (group III). These findings suggest that ET-1 may contribute to the development of hypotension and rebound hypertension during HD."}
{"answers": "While FS was commonly used in patients undergoing thyroidectomy at our institution, in no patient over the last decade did FS correctly alter the intraoperative management. Given the time required to perform FS and the cost associated with it, we believe that routine FS should not be performed in these patients.", "prediction_text": "No, frozen section analysis did not alter the intraoperative management of multinodular thyroid disease in the study population."}
{"answers": "Elderly patients have informational and relational needs similar to those of younger patients. In fact, most of the whole sample flagged up the need for higher levels of satisfaction especially concerning a better dialogue with health staff, along with a new factor: the need to talk to people with the same illness.", "prediction_text": "Yes, elderly cancer patients have different care needs compared with younger ones. The study found that older patients were more likely to request financial-insurance information, the need to talk to people with the same illness, and the need for a better dialogue with clinicians."}
{"answers": "According to the results of our study and the data from the international literature, the entity globulomaxillary cyst is no longer justified.", "prediction_text": "No, globulomaxillary cysts do not exist as a distinct entity. Instead, they are a collection of various cystic lesions that were previously misdiagnosed as globulomaxillary cysts. The study found that these lesions can be classified into seven different entities: lateral periodontal cysts, radicular cysts, keratocystic odontogenic tumors, adenomatoid odontogenic tumors, periapical granulomas, residual cysts, and undefined jaw cysts."}
{"answers": "Although components of the CSM (cognitive and emotional representations, coping strategies) were associated with fears of recurrence, optimism was found to be the strongest predictor of fear, independent of anxiety and level of fear reported prior to treatment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, according to the study, pre-treatment fears and optimism can predict long-term fears of recurrence in head and neck cancer survivors."}
{"answers": "Older adults enrolled in PICT with more symptoms may sacrifice QOL for experimental treatment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, symptoms matter when considering older adults (OA) for phase I clinical trials. OA with more symptoms (>3) had more admissions, complications, and greater decline in functional status compared to those with fewer symptoms (\u22643)."}
{"answers": "Effective CPAP treatment in IPF patients with OSA results in a significant improvement in daily living activities based on the FOSQ, namely an OSA-specific follow-up instrument. Improvement was also noted in other questionnaires assessing quality of life, though not to a statistically significant degree, probably because of the multifactorial influences of IPF on physical and mental health. The probability of poor CPAP compliance was high and could only be eliminated with intense follow-up by the CPAP clinic staff.", "prediction_text": "Yes, CPAP therapy offers a better quality of life and sleep in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The study found a statistically significant improvement in the Functional Outcomes in Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ) scores at 1, 3, and 6 months after CPAP initiation. The FOSQ is a measure of overall life quality and sleep quality. The improvement in FOSQ scores suggests that CPAP therapy improved the patients' overall quality of life and sleep."}
{"answers": "Income support policy may be a significant new lever for improving population health, especially that of lower-income persons. Even though the findings are robust, further analyses are needed to confirm their reliability. Future research should examine a variety of different income support policies, as well as whether a broader range of social and economic policies affect health.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program reduces disability in the elderly. An increase of $100 per month in the maximum SSI benefit was found to cause a 0.46 percentage point decrease in the rate of mobility limitations among all single elderly individuals. This effect was robust to various sensitivity analyses, including limiting the analysis to subgroups more likely to receive SSI, varying the disability measure, and controlling for potential confounding factors such as Medicaid coverage."}
{"answers": "None of the clinical identifiers for early-stage adhesive capsulitis previously proposed by expert consensus have been validated in this study. Clinicians should be aware that commonly used clinical identifiers may not be applicable to this stage.", "prediction_text": "The study found that only one clinical identifier, pain at the end of range of all measured active movements, was associated with a positive anesthetic response (PAR) in patients with early-stage primary/idiopathic adhesive capsulitis."}
{"answers": "Despite current recommendations, cough and cold medicines are still used in children younger than 6 years of age. A significant portion of caregivers report that they are still unaware of public warnings, potential side effects, and interactions with other medications.", "prediction_text": "Yes, concerns about the use of cold preparations in young children still exist, as 72% of caregivers incorrectly dosed the medication they desired to give."}
{"answers": "Vitamin C reduces the prevalence of complex regional pain syndrome after wrist fractures. A daily dose of 500 mg for fifty days is recommended.", "prediction_text": "Yes, vitamin C can prevent complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) in patients with wrist fractures. The study found that patients who received vitamin C had a significantly lower prevalence of CRPS compared to those who received a placebo. The effect was dose-dependent, with the highest risk reduction observed in the 1500 mg/day group. Early cast-related complaints were also found to be a predictor of CRPS development."}
{"answers": "The tendency to clear one's plate when eating is associated with increased body weight and may constitute a risk factor for weight gain.", "prediction_text": "Yes, plate clearing is a risk factor for obesity."}
{"answers": "ACS is common in patients with SCD who present with fever and was grossly underestimated by evaluating physicians. History and physical examination appear to be of little value in defining which febrile patients require CXR. In view of the mortality and morbidity associated with ACS, empiric CXR should be considered when evaluating a febrile patient with SCD.", "prediction_text": "No, clinician assessment for acute chest syndrome (ACS) in febrile patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) is not accurate enough. According to the study, only 39% of physicians were able to accurately predict ACS, and physical examination findings and symptoms did not help identify patients with ACS."}
{"answers": "We conclude that the quality of rectal cancer excision, as defined by mesorectal grades, achieved by supervised colorectal trainees is comparable with that achieved by consultants.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no significant difference in the quality of total mesorectal excision (TME) surgery between supervised colorectal trainees and consultants, as measured by mesorectal grades."}
{"answers": "Dutch primary schools could play a more important role in fostering healthy eating habits among children. The school food policy could be improved by clearly formulating food rules, simplifying supervision of the food rules, and defining how to enforce the food rules. In addition, the school food policy will only influence children's dietary behaviour if both the school and the parents support the policy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is room for improvement in the school food policy at Dutch primary schools. While most schools have a written food policy, the rules are not always clearly defined, and there is a lack of parental involvement in enforcing the policy. Additionally, there is a discrepancy between the perceptions of principals and teachers regarding the school's attention to nutrition and health, and parents' beliefs about their role in fostering healthy eating habits among children."}
{"answers": "Speed discrimination, per se, is not impaired in schizophrenia patients. The observed abnormality appears to be a consequence of impairment in generating or integrating the feedback information from eye movements. This study introduces a novel approach to motion perception studies and highlights the importance of concurrently measuring eye movements to understand interactions between these two systems; the results argue for a conceptual revision regarding motion perception abnormality in schizophrenia.", "prediction_text": "No, the study suggests that motion perception deficit in schizophrenia is not solely a consequence of eye-tracking abnormality. The results of the two speed discrimination experiments showed that while there was no difference in speed discrimination thresholds between schizophrenia patients and control subjects at a short stimulus duration (150 msec), there was a significant difference at a longer duration (300 msec). Additionally, the frequency of eye tracking during the 300 msec stimulus was significantly correlated with speed discrimination in control subjects, but not in patients, suggesting that eye-tracking initiation may benefit control subjects but not patients. These find"}
{"answers": "(1) There is little overlap between regions of CFAEs during AF and regions of SRF measured in the time domain or the frequency domain, (2) the majority of SRF appears to occur in regions with wave-front collision, (3) the distribution of SRF is similar in patients with AF and normal controls, suggesting that this may not have an important role in AF maintenance and may not be a suitable ablation target.", "prediction_text": "There is no significant relationship between complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAEs) recorded during atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm fractionation (SRF) in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation."}
{"answers": "Continence function remained undisturbed after anastomotic leakage due to rectal resection", "prediction_text": "Yes, anastomotic leakage after rectal resection for cancer does affect functional outcome, as there was no significant difference in continence score between patients with and without leakage."}
{"answers": "No evidence was found for OPLL to have any effect on the initial neurologic status or recovery in motor function after traumatic cervical cord injury, suggesting that the neurologic outcome is not significantly dependent on canal space.", "prediction_text": "No, ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) does not significantly affect the neurological outcome after traumatic cervical spinal cord injury (SCI)."}
{"answers": "Circumferences and related ratios scale significantly to height, notably after adjustment for age and race, across subjects who are representative of the US population. These observations have implications for the clinical and epidemiologic use of these anthropometric measures and indexes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, adult body circumferences (waist circumference (WC) and hip circumference (HC)) are associated with height in adults. After adjusting for age and race, WC and HC scaled to height with powers of 0.76 \u00b1 0.08 and 0.45 \u00b1 0.05 in men, and 0.80 \u00b1 0.05 and 0.53 \u00b1 0.04 in women, respectively (all P<0.001). Age- and race-adjusted incremental increases in circumferences ranged from 0.2 to 0.5 cm per centimeter increase in"}
{"answers": "We found evidence that pain can be a significant clinical problem in psychiatric patients which seems to be underestimated in psychiatry. The investigated patients in general adult psychiatry are characterized by specific risk factors different from clinical subpopulations of other disciplines.", "prediction_text": "Yes, pain is a clinically relevant problem in general adult psychiatry, with a high prevalence of pain complaints among patients, particularly those with affective disorders, neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders, and psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. The study found that nearly 50% of patients experienced pain at the time of the survey, with a higher prevalence over the past 6 and 12 months. Additionally, the study identified depression and the number of past admissions to psychiatric hospitals as statistically significant risk factors for pain."}
{"answers": "This study found that influences on coping were multifactorial and moderated by age. These factors have implications for interventions designed to enhance coping strategies.", "prediction_text": "Yes, age moderates the effect of personality disorder on coping style in psychiatric inpatients. Older adults with personality disorder reported lower levels of dysfunctional coping strategies than younger adults with personality disorder."}
{"answers": "The study data suggests a possible correlation between cervical discopathy and cervical MS plaque.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant correlation between cervical cord plaques and discopathy in patients with multiple sclerosis. In this study, 69.1% of patients with cervical discopathy had cervical cord plaques at the same site."}
{"answers": "Higher MCVs and AST/ALT ratios in ASH reflect the severity of underlying liver disease and do not differentiate NASH from ASH. Instead, these biomarkers might prove useful in guiding selection of patients for liver biopsy and in targeting therapy.", "prediction_text": "Routine laboratory parameters, including mean corpuscular volume (MCV), AST/ALT ratio, and sex, can be useful in differentiating nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) from alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) in patients with liver biopsy-confirmed steatohepatitis. In particular, MCV was elevated in 53% of ASH patients and normal in all NASH patients, and the AST/ALT ratio was a significant predictor of high-grade fibrosis."}
{"answers": "We found no evidence that IBR compromised the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy, although there was a significant incidence of implant infection.", "prediction_text": "No, immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) does not compromise the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy."}
{"answers": "Economic inequalities in breast and cervical cancer screening are low in LMICs with high screening coverage. These findings are consistent with the inverse equity hypothesis and indicate that high levels of equity in cancer screening are feasible even in countries with high income inequality.", "prediction_text": "No, the inverse equity hypothesis does not apply to coverage of cancer screening in middle-income countries. The study found that economic inequalities in screening participation were substantially lower or non-existent in countries with higher aggregate coverage."}
{"answers": "Post tonsillectomy antibiotics did not prove to have a role in minimizing postoperative morbidity. Moreover, analgesics given on the basis of as required had a limited value.", "prediction_text": "No, the use of postoperative antibiotics does not decrease post-tonsillectomy morbidity, as found in this study."}
{"answers": "The study findings suggest that adopting measurement-based care, such as using the PHQ-9, is achievable, even in practices with limited resources.", "prediction_text": "Yes, systematic use of patient-rated depression severity monitoring through the Nine-Item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) is both helpful and feasible in clinical psychiatry. The study found that all 17 practices adopted PHQ-9 as a routine part of depression care within one year, and 93% of patient contacts were influenced by PHQ-9 scores in clinical decision making. Additionally, the use of PHQ-9 led to treatment changes in 40% of patient contacts, including changes to antidepressant medication, psychotherapy, and suicide risk assessment."}
{"answers": "There is no advantage to an intramedullary nail versus a sliding compression hip screw for low-energy pertrochanteric fractures AO/OTA 31-A1 and A2, specifically with its increased cost and lack of evidence to show decreased complications or improved patient outcome.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no significant advantage to using an intramedullary nail in the treatment of pertrochanteric fractures compared to a sliding compression hip screw, according to the study."}
{"answers": "Just over half the patients in this present cohort may be physically able to undertake some aspects of self-managed foot care, including nail clipping and filing, callus filing and daily hygiene and inspection.", "prediction_text": "No, only 57% of the rheumatoid arthritis patients in the study were physically able to participate in the FOOTSTEP self-management foot care program due to limitations in sight, reach, and grip strength."}
{"answers": "The homogeneity we found in the deprivation-mortality relationship across the regions of Scotland and the absence of a contextualized effect of region highlights the importance of taking a broader strategic policy that can combat the toxic impacts of socio-economic deprivation on health. Focusing on a few specific places (e.g. 15% of the poorest areas) to concentrate resources might be a good start but the impact of socio-economic deprivation on mortality is not restricted to a few places. A comprehensive strategy that can be sustained over time might be needed to interrupt the linkages between poverty and mortality.", "prediction_text": "Yes, context matters for the relationship between deprivation and all-cause mortality. The study found that the relationship between deprivation and mortality varies across different regions in Scotland, with concentrations of high mortality rates and deprivation in the West of Scotland and low values in the rest of the country. The study rejected the hypothesis of spatial heterogeneity in the relationship between socio-economic deprivation and mortality, suggesting that contextual factors play a significant role in shaping this relationship."}
{"answers": "This study adds to the growing body of literature documenting the importance of the individual therapist as an important factor in the change process.", "prediction_text": "The study found that approximately 12% of the variability in the outcome of cognitive processing therapy (CPT) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a Veterans Affairs (VA) specialty clinic was due to differences between therapists. The trainer identified several characteristics of effective therapists, including effectively addressing patient avoidance, using flexible interpersonal style, and developing a strong therapeutic alliance. These findings suggest that there is some degree of uniformity in the implementation of evidence-based treatments in practice, but that there is still room for improvement in terms of therapist variability and effectiveness."}
{"answers": "New depression diagnosis and antidepressant use was shown to be less likely in areas of higher own-ethnic density for some, but not all, ethnic groups.", "prediction_text": "Yes, depression diagnosis and antidepressant prescribing vary by location. The study found that black and minority ethnic groups are up to four times less likely to be newly diagnosed with depression or prescribed antidepressants compared to white British patients. Additionally, there was an inverse relationship between neighbourhood ethnic density and new depression diagnosis for some groups, with a decrease in depression diagnosis for groups with higher proportions of their own ethnicity in their neighbourhood. However, the opposite effect was found for black Caribbean patients, who showed a higher likelihood of depression diagnosis and antidepressant use in areas with higher proportions of their own ethnicity."}
{"answers": "These findings suggest a malleable relationship between knee extensor strength, dynamic stability, and disease severity in PD. Although strength is only one piece of the puzzle in the functional outcome of PD, these findings may assist clinicians in designing appropriate interventions aimed at increasing function and decreasing fall risk in PD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, knee extensor strength, dynamic postural stability, and functional ambulation are related in Parkinson's disease. The study found a positive correlation between knee extensor strength and dynamic postural stability, and a negative correlation between knee extensor strength and disease severity. Additionally, dynamic postural stability was found to be negatively correlated with disease severity and positively correlated with functional ambulation."}
{"answers": "It is concluded that preloading colloid fluid prior to repositioning could prevent the decrease of systolic blood pressure and central venous pressure during sitting positioning without other complications.", "prediction_text": "Yes, preloading with colloids before positioning neurosurgical patients can prevent hemodynamic changes when they are subsequently changed to the seated position."}
{"answers": "Data from Safe Implementation of Treatments in Stroke-International Stroke Thrombolysis Register suggest that intravenous thrombolysis may modify the observed survival and recovery advantage for men expected in the natural course of an ischemic stroke, with a possible larger beneficial treatment effect in women when compared with men.", "prediction_text": "Yes, sex influences the response to intravenous thrombolysis in ischemic stroke. Men are more likely to have a better functional outcome and lower mortality rate after treatment, while women are more likely to experience symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage and have a higher mortality rate."}
{"answers": "The rate of early infection without antibiotic prophylaxis before TIVAD placement in the interventional radiology suite is<1%. Based on these data, use of prophylactic antibiotics for TIVAD placement is not recommended.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, prophylactic antibiotics may not be necessary for totally implantable venous access device (TIVAD) placement by interventional radiologists, as the rate of early infection (CLABSI) was low (0.6%) in the study population."}
{"answers": "The PRP group recorded reduced pain, swelling, and trismus as well as enhanced and faster bone healing compared with those in the control. Hence the study showed that topical application of PRP gel has a beneficial effect in enhancing socket healing after third molar surgery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that the application of autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) gel to the socket of mandibular third molars can enhance healing after surgical extraction. The PRP group had lower postoperative pain scores compared to the control group at all time points, and the scores for lamina dura, trabecular pattern, and bone density were better in the PRP group, although these differences were not statistically significant."}
{"answers": "This study confirms that physicians often differ from patients in the assessment of QoL. This is most likely due to a difference in patient-physician perception of \"significant\" LUTS and clearly demonstrates the importance of patient evaluated QoL in routine clinical assessment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a discrepancy between patient and physician quality of life assessment in women with lower urinary tract dysfunction. The physician underestimated the impact of symptoms on the patient's quality of life in 4 out of 9 domains, and overestimated it in 5 out of 9 domains, with a mean difference of 5.5% and 6.9%, respectively."}
{"answers": "Left ventricular dimensions are not influenced by MetS. Rather than MetS, hypertension is primarily responsible for changes in left ventricular dimensions. However, left atrial enlargement is more prominent in patients with MetS, suggesting that each MetS criterion contributes to left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.", "prediction_text": "Yes, accompanying metabolic syndrome contributes to increased heart dimensions in hypertensive patients. The study found that patients with metabolic syndrome had significantly increased interventricular septum and posterior wall thickness, left atrial diameter, relative wall thickness, and left ventricular mass compared to those without metabolic syndrome. The only significant difference between the two patient groups was that metabolic syndrome was associated with a greater left atrial diameter. Additionally, left atrial diameter was found to be correlated with the number of MetS criteria."}
{"answers": "A higher PV in PMR increases the risk of prolonged steroid therapy and late GCA. Female sex and particular HLA alleles may increase the risk of late GCA. Starting patients on>15 mg prednisolone is associated with a prolonged steroid duration.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the prognosis of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) can be predicted at disease onset. The study found that elevated plasma viscosity (PV) at baseline was associated with a reduced probability of stopping steroids within 5 years (hazard ratio = 0.49, 95% CI 0.29, 0.82). Additionally, starting treatment at >15 mg prednisolone was also associated with a reduced probability of stopping steroids within a given time interval between 27 and 51%. No significant predictors of relapse were identified, but female sex, HLA-DRB1*0"}
{"answers": "The study suggests that there is no difference in clinical toxicity profiles or survival outcomes with either definitive chemoradiotherapy or chemoradiation followed by surgery in management of locally advanced esophageal cancer.", "prediction_text": "No, surgical resection is not required for the management of locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma esophageal cancer. The study found that chemoradiotherapy alone can achieve similar survival outcomes as chemoradiotherapy plus surgical resection in patients with resectable disease."}
{"answers": "Our results give first evidence that lowered beta E during alcohol withdrawal may contribute to anxiety as a common disturbance during this state.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that lowered beta-endorphin (beta E) levels during acute alcohol withdrawal are associated with anxiety in alcoholics. The study found that plasma beta E levels were significantly lower in alcoholics compared to healthy controls, and that self-rated anxiety decreased significantly between day 1 and day 14 of alcohol withdrawal. Additionally, the study found that beta E levels were inversely correlated with anxiety on both days 1 and 14, and that this correlation was largely independent of plasma levels of the pituitary-adrenocortical hormone ACTH. These findings suggest that withdrawal-indu"}
{"answers": "Increased private health care activity does not reduce the demand for NHS care: NHS and private referral rates were positively associated with each other after adjusting for age, deprivation and practice.", "prediction_text": "No, increased use of private healthcare does not reduce the demand for NHS care. In fact, the study found that areas with higher private referral rates had higher NHS referral rates as well."}
{"answers": "Skewed X-inactivation is not associated with recurrent spontaneous abortion but is associated with increasing maternal age.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is an association between recurrent spontaneous abortion and skewed X-inactivation. The study found that women with recurrent spontaneous abortion have a higher rate of extreme skewing (90% or greater) than other groups, except for primiparous women."}
{"answers": "Findings suggest that analgesic management of daily pain is better for nursing home residents enrolled in hospice than for those not enrolled in hospice.The prescribing practices portrayed by this study reveal that many dying nursing home residents in daily pain are receiving no analgesic treatment or are receiving analgesic treatment inconsistent with AMDA and other pain management guidelines. Improving the analgesic management of pain in nursing homes is essential if high-quality end-of-life care in nursing homes is to be achieved.", "prediction_text": "Yes, receipt of hospice care in nursing homes improves the management of pain at the end of life. Hospice residents were twice as likely as non-hospice residents to receive regular treatment for daily pain after controlling for clinical confounders."}
{"answers": "The continuity-of-care experiences of vascular trainees are suboptimal. This is especially true for postoperative clinic assessment. Same-day admission surgery accounted for most of the cases and was associated with the poorest continuity of care. To provide complete surgical training in an era of changing therapeutic modalities and same-day admission surgery, vascular programs must be creative in structuring training to include adequate ambulatory experience.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the continuity of care experience of residents in an academic vascular department was suboptimal, with only 57% of patients receiving complete in-hospital continuity of care. Emergent cases were associated with a higher rate of preoperative assessment, while elective cases admitted before the day of surgery had higher rates of preoperative assessment and involvement in the decision to operate compared to same-day admission patients."}
{"answers": "Simple detorsion was not accompanied by an increase in morbidity, and all patients studied had functioning ovarian tissue on follow-up despite the surgeon's assessment of the degree of ovarian ischemia. Detorsion is the procedure of choice for most cases of ovarian torsion in children.", "prediction_text": "No, oophorectomy is not necessary for all children with ovarian torsion. According to the study, detorsion alone can be effective in treating many ovarian torsions in children, with similar postoperative complication and length of stay rates as oophorectomy."}
{"answers": "Half-dose MR angiography using diluted contrast medium injected at a rate of 1 mL/second depicted the abdominal aorta and its branches as clearly as using a full single dose.", "prediction_text": "Half-dose contrast-enhanced three-dimensional MR angiography is sufficient for depicting the abdominal aorta and pelvis, as the signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio of these regions were not significantly different between the half-dose and full-dose groups."}
{"answers": "There was no evidence of a trend in unsafe sex behaviour over time. However, several subgroups were identified as being more likely to report unsafe sex and should be targeted for specific interventions.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no evidence of an increase in reported unsafe sexual behavior among HIV-infected individuals over time, according to the study."}
{"answers": "In normal clinical practice, chemotherapy significantly prolongs survival in patients with performance status of less than 2, more time being gained if there is no associated weight loss. We conclude that the reluctance shown by many pneumologists toward using this treatment is not entirely justified.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that chemotherapy may be beneficial for patients with advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) in clinical practice, as it was shown to be effective in improving survival in patients with ECOG scores of 0 to 1. However, the study also found that the advantage of chemotherapy may be limited to patients with good performance status (ECOG score of 0 to 1), as survival was significantly shorter in patients with ECOG score of 2. Therefore, pneumologists' skepticism towards chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC may be partially justified, as the treatment may not be effective for all patients."}
{"answers": "The Medicaid Demonstration in Florida appears to result in lower PMPM expenditures. Demonstration PSNs generated slightly greater reductions in expenditures compared to Demonstration HMOs. PSNs appear to be a promising model for delivering care to Medicaid enrollees.", "prediction_text": "Yes, provider service networks (PSNs) in Florida's Medicaid program result in lower per member per month (PMPM) expenditures compared to health maintenance organizations (HMOs). Specifically, among Supplemental Security Income (SSI) enrollees, PMPM expenditures increased by $40 in the Demonstration counties compared to $186 in non-Demonstration counties, with PSNs resulting in $7 lower PMPM expenditures than HMOs. Similar savings were seen among Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) enrollees, but to a lesser extent."}
{"answers": "In this series, in accordance to available testosterone, the prevalence of PADAM was determined to be high, in which the ADAM questionnaire rendered a low diagnostic efficiency. PADAM diagnosis could be clinically suspected when symptoms of sexual dysfunction are present.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the Androgen Deficiency of Aging Men (ADAM) questionnaire is useful for screening partial androgenic deficiency of aging men. The study found that the ADAM questionnaire had a sensitivity of 83.3% and specificity of 19.7% in detecting PADAM, with item 1 (decreased sexual desire) being a better predictor of hypogonadism than the complete questionnaire."}
{"answers": "We found that intrapartum VAS was an effective predictor of fetal acidosis in cases of FHR variable decelerations, but its predictability for fetal acidosis in cases of FHR late decelerations was limited. Both VAS and fetal blood pH are good predictors of neonatal morbidity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that intrapartum vibroacoustic stimulation (VAS) is an effective predictor of fetal acidosis during labor. The study found a significant association between the acceleration response to VAS and fetal blood pH, with a pH of 7.20 or higher indicating a lower risk of acidosis. The study also found that a negative response to VAS (no acceleration or decelerations) was associated with a higher risk of acidosis, with a higher predictive value for neonatal morbidity than fetal acidosis alone."}
{"answers": "Emergency US fellowship programs had a positive impact on residents' US educational experiences. Emergency medicine residents performed more scans overall and also used bedside US for more advanced applications in programs with EUS fellowships.", "prediction_text": "Yes, emergency ultrasound fellowship programs significantly impact emergency medicine residents' ultrasound education, with residents in programs with fellowships performing more scans and reporting fewer barriers to US education compared to those in programs without fellowships."}
{"answers": "Obesity does not seem to impact the severity of injury, mortality rate, types of injury, and procedure outcomes in children. Obese patients are more likely to have rib and pelvic injuries.", "prediction_text": "Yes, obesity impacts the pattern and outcome of trauma in children. Obese children were found to be older, have higher injury severity scores, lower pediatric trauma scores, lower heart rates, and lower respiratory rates compared to non-obese children. They were also more likely to have rib fractures and pelvic injuries. There was no significant association between mortality and obesity."}
{"answers": "The laparoscopic-assisted approach to Crohn's disease is feasible and safe with good outcomes. Co-morbid preoperative findings such as abscess, phlegmon, or recurrent disease at the previous ileocolic anastomosis are not contraindications to a successful laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resection in select patients.", "prediction_text": "No, abscesses, phlegmons, or recurrent disease at a previous ileocolic anastomosis are not contraindications for laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resection in patients with Crohn's disease. The study found that these factors do not significantly affect the success of the procedure, as measured by operative blood loss, time, conversion to open procedure, morbidity, and mortality."}
{"answers": "When controlling for preoperative features, the year in which RP was performed is a predictor of outcome on multivariate analysis. This effect could not be explained by stage migration.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the year of radical prostatectomy (RP) is a predictor of treatment outcome in prostate cancer, with better outcomes observed in patients undergoing surgery in the mid-1990s compared to earlier or later periods."}
{"answers": "The menopausal transition warrants attention as a period of vulnerability to MDD recurrence, while health factors and VMS should be considered important risk factors for first lifetime-onset of MDD during midlife.", "prediction_text": "Risk factors for major depression during midlife among women with and without prior major depression are different. Women without a prior MDD history had a lower risk of developing MDD during midlife compared to those with a prior MDD history, and their risk profiles differed. Health conditions prior to baseline and during follow-ups, perception of functioning, and vasomotor symptoms were risk factors for first lifetime-onset MDD, while being peri- and post-menopausal, psychological symptoms, and a prior anxiety disorder were predominant risk factors for MDD recurrence."}
{"answers": "Most children undergoing congenital heart surgery can be extubated in the operating room. Most neonates, including many undergoing complex procedures, can be extubated within the first 24 hours after surgery. Early extubation was associated with low morbidity rates and short lengths of intensive care unit and hospital stays.", "prediction_text": "Yes, early extubation (within 24 hours) should be the goal for children after congenital cardiac surgery. The study found that early extubation was associated with lower mortality (1% vs 9%, P<.001) and a lower rate of reintubation (4% vs 23%, P<.001) compared to delayed extubation. Additionally, early extubation was achieved in 89% of cases, and the overall mortality was 1.5%. The predictors of delayed extubation were preoperative mechanical ventilation, weight<5 kg, a longer procedure time, and the need for postoperative inot"}
{"answers": "A significant association between farming and PSV has been identified for the first time. Results also support previously reported associations with silica, solvents, and allergy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, environmental factors are important in primary systemic vasculitis (PSV). The study found significant associations between PSV and several environmental factors, including farming in the index year and during working lifetime, high occupational silica exposure in the index year and during working lifetime, high occupational solvent exposure in the index year and during working lifetime, drug allergy, and overall allergy. These findings suggest that environmental exposures may play a role in the development of PSV."}
{"answers": "This study that shows that adequate femoral tunnel lengths can be safely created without knee hyperflex - ion using flexible instruments via an anteromedial portal.", "prediction_text": "Yes, flexible instruments can create adequate femoral tunnel lengths at 90\u00b0 of knee flexion in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The study found that the mean intra-osseous length for 90\u00b0 flexion was 32.1 mm (22 mm to 45 mm), which was within the acceptable range for ACL reconstruction. Additionally, there were no significant differences in distance to the LCL among the groups, and a trend towards longer distances to the common peroneal nerve with increased flexion was observed."}
{"answers": "A proportionally longer treatment duration was identified as an adverse factor in low-risk patients. Treatment breaks resulting in a NTDR of>/=33% (e.g., four or more breaks during a 40-fraction treatment, 5 d/wk) should be avoided.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the duration of external beam radiotherapy (RT) treatment is associated with the outcome after RT for prostate cancer. A longer duration of treatment is associated with a higher risk of biochemical failure (FFBF) in low-risk patients, while it is not a significant predictor in intermediate-risk and high-risk patients."}
{"answers": "TEE allowed a diagnosis of site involvement that did correlate with the anatomic diagnosis obtained during the operation. This fact contributed to the management of patients and was of great help in guiding the surgical intervention. Echo-oriented single-valve replacement may be a safe strategy for patients with PVE and double prostheses.", "prediction_text": "Single-valve replacement in patients with double prostheses may be safe in the treatment of prosthetic valve endocarditis, with a positive predictive value of 100% for the preoperative diagnosis of the site of infection using echocardiography. However, there is a risk of mortality within a week after the procedure, with four patients dying in this time frame. Despite this, nine patients survived the surgical procedure, completed antimicrobial therapy, and were followed up for 15.78 months without any relapses."}
{"answers": "Acute hepatitis C in the post universal blood products screening era was found to be predominantly an iatrogenic disease in the investigated localities. This finding should direct attention and resources towards the development and implementation of preventive measures.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that the majority of acute hepatitis C cases in Israel (65%) were due to iatrogenic transmission, involving minimal procedures and clinical settings, with the majority of patients being older and in monogamous relationships."}
{"answers": "Our results suggest a protective effect of breast-feeding among children with a family history of atopy that is not confined to the period of breast-feeding but continues during the first three years of life. Breast-feeding should be promoted in children with a family history of atopy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, our study suggests that breast-feeding may provide protection against childhood illnesses in children with a family history of atopy. Breast-fed children had lower rates of gastroenteritis, lower respiratory tract infections, and digestive tract disorders in the first year of life, and fewer respiratory tract infections and skin infections over the next three years of life compared to non-breast-fed children."}
{"answers": "Transrectal ultrasound guided and fusion biopsy cancer detection rates decreased with increasing prostate volume. However, magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy had a higher prostate cancer detection rate compared to that of transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy in the literature. Magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy represents a promising solution for patients with suspicion of prostate cancer and an enlarged prostate.", "prediction_text": "Yes, magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy can improve cancer detection in enlarged prostates. The overall detection rate of the magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion platform was 55%, with a significantly higher detection rate (71.1%) in prostates less than 40 cc."}
{"answers": "There is no difference in postoperative morbidity, rates of rehospitalization, in-patient mortality or hospitalization costs in geriatric patients undergoing regional or general anesthesia for repair of hip fracture. Delay in surgery beyond 3 days and ICU admission both increase cost of hospitalization.", "prediction_text": "No, regional anesthesia does not decrease morbidity, mortality, or healthcare costs in geriatric patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture compared to general anesthesia."}
{"answers": "Mesocolon invasion should be included in T4 for the staging of gastric cancer.", "prediction_text": "Yes, direct mesocolon invasion should be included in the T4 category for the staging of gastric cancer. The study found that patients with mesocolon invasion had significantly worse curability, nodal metastasis, and survival compared to those without mesocolon invasion, and that the survival of patients who underwent curative resection was better than those with incurable factors. These findings suggest that mesocolon invasion is an important prognostic factor in gastric cancer and should be included in the T4 category for staging purposes."}
{"answers": "Genetic variants identified in the present study may be insufficient to promote early carotid atherosclerosis.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mutations causing low HDL-C are associated with increased carotid intima-media thickness."}
{"answers": "The Turkish version of the EQ-5D-based utility score seems to be a valid instrument in the assessment of quality of life studies in patients with acute coronary syndrome.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the EQ-5D is a valid quality of life instrument in patients with acute coronary syndrome. The study found a significant correlation between the EQ-5D index score and the MacNew subscales, with a multiple linear regression analysis showing that the MacNew global score was a significant predictor of the EQ-5D index score."}
{"answers": "We found an improved survival associated with cardiologist care and a mixture of general practitioner and cardiologist care compared with general practitioner care. The pattern of outpatient care may therefore be important for the survival of patients with CHF.", "prediction_text": "Yes, specialty care (cardiology) is associated with improved survival of patients with congestive heart failure, compared to general medicine care alone. The risk of death was significantly higher in patients who received only general medicine care (GM-only) and those who did not receive any specialty care (no-GM/CARD), and the risk was lowest in patients who received both general medicine and cardiology care (MIXED group)."}
{"answers": "Comparison of mother-offspring and father-offspring associations for BMI suggests that intergenerational acceleration mechanisms do not make an important contribution to levels of childhood BMI within the population. Associations at later ages and for different components of body composition now require study.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is evidence of an intrauterine influence on obesity. The study found that the association between maternal and paternal body mass index (BMI) and offspring BMI at age 7.5 was similar, suggesting that the intrauterine environment plays a role in the development of obesity."}
{"answers": "TEE is useful to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors. An FAC less than 50% is present in 36% of potential heart donors. Because left ventricular dysfunction is often reversible shortly after transplantation, an FAC below 50% may not necessarily preclude the use of hearts for transplantation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, marginally acceptable hearts with left ventricular dysfunction (FAC < 50%) can be suitable for transplantation, as evidenced by the successful transplantation of 36 hearts from the 40 hearts harvested in this study. However, the overall actuarial survival was lower in this group compared to hearts with better left ventricular function (FAC > 50%)."}
{"answers": "Pediatricians should be alert to the earliest manifestations of AEA. Awareness of choking games among the young and, of those, a subset who eventually progress to potentially fatal AEA is strongly encouraged among all primary care professionals who may be able to interrupt the behavior.", "prediction_text": "Yes, autoerotic asphyxiation (AEA) can lead to a lethal outcome due to the intentional induction of hypoxia or anoxia for sexual excitement. The study found that AEA is a common and elusive practice among children, preteens, and adolescents, and can result in unintended death. Pediatricians can identify and address concerns about AEA by demonstrating a willingness to discuss the issue and provide appropriate interventions."}
{"answers": "The whole-body MRI protocol for the detection of bone metastases could safely be limited to the T1w sequence in adults, especially at 3 T. There is no need for an additional STIR sequence. These initial results will have a major impact on the department's workflow if confirmed by larger studies as they will help reduce examination time and therefore save financial resources.", "prediction_text": "No, STIR imaging cannot be omitted for the diagnosis of bone metastases at 1.5 T and 3 T. T1-weighted (T1w) sequences revealed a higher number of metastases compared to STIR images at both field strengths, with a sensitivity of 99.72% and 100.00% for T1w at 3 T and 1.5 T, respectively. In contrast, STIR imaging detected fewer bone metastases in 53% of patients at 3 T and 37.5% of patients at 1.5 T. Qualitative analysis also showed better lesion conspicu"}
{"answers": "This study found that there was poor agreement between the AD's decision and the subsequent MR's decision regarding the fitness of those seafarers who decided to appeal against the AD's initial assessment. The reasons for this are considered.", "prediction_text": "No, approved doctors and medical referees in the UK do not agree when assessing a seafarer's fitness. The study found that the extent of agreement between the two groups was poor (Kappa K = 0.18)."}
{"answers": "In our study, we suggest that glomerular hyperfiltration due to pregnancy does not have adverse effects on kidney in women with more parities. Pregnancy may have possible protective mechanisms for kidney against adverse effects of glomerular hyperfiltration.", "prediction_text": "Yes, glomerular hyperfiltration in pregnancy can damage the kidney in women with more parities."}
{"answers": "Implant coating with an antibacterial-loaded hydrogel reduces bacterial colonization and biofilm formation in vitro.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the antibacterial-loaded hydrogel coating on implants can reduce bacterial colonization and biofilm formation in vitro."}
{"answers": "Location of death varies by country of birth. BAME groups are more likely to die in a hospital and less likely to die at home or in a hospice. Further investigation is needed to determine whether these differences result from patient-centred preferences, or other environment or service-related factors. This knowledge will enable strategies to be developed to improve access to relevant palliative care and related services, where necessary.", "prediction_text": "Yes, ethnicity affects where people with cancer die. The study found that decedents from certain ethnic groups were more likely to die in hospitals, while those from other groups were more likely to die at home. Specifically, those born in Asia and Africa were more likely to die in hospitals, while those born in the Caribbean were less likely to die in hospitals."}
{"answers": "Overall, 7% of women in our cohort met either clinical or molecular criteria for Lynch syndrome. All of these women had a prior history or a first-degree relative with an HNPCC-associated cancer. Limiting genetic evaluation to women with synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancer who have a family history suggestive of HNPCC may appropriately identify women with Lynch syndrome.", "prediction_text": "Yes, women with synchronous primary cancers of the endometrium and ovary are at increased risk of having Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer; HNPCC). The study found that 5% of the patients (5/102) had molecular findings consistent with a germline mutation in either MSH2 or MLH1, which are genes associated with HNPCC."}
{"answers": "CMV-IgM and IgG antibodies assessment was not a potential discriminative test to identify congenitally infected newborns. In addition, low birth weight and small head circumference at birth failed to predict congenital CMV infection. CMV-DNA detection in umbilical cord blood at the time of delivery using real-time PCR of all newborns is recommended as decisive, rapid and non-invasive test.", "prediction_text": "Yes, low birth weight is a risk indicator for congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. The study found that among the newborns with birth weight <2700 grams or head circumference <32 cm, CMV-DNA was detected in four out of 200 newborns, with one of them being above the adopted weight limit. This suggests that low birth weight may be a risk factor for CMV infection."}
{"answers": "The use of instrumental variables allowed us to demonstrate a significant relationship between better ambulatory process of care and better health-related quality of life. This finding underscores the importance of efforts to improve the process of care.", "prediction_text": "Yes, ambulatory process of care predicts health-related quality of life outcomes for patients with chronic disease. Specifically, better process of care is associated with smaller declines in health-related quality of life scores over time, and the application of the best quartile of process of care to patients currently receiving poor process is associated with a 4.24 increment in health-related quality of life outcomes."}
{"answers": "To date, the newly developed Singapore equation is the most accurate BMR prediction equation in Chinese and is applicable for use in a large BMI range including those overweight and obese.", "prediction_text": "The current prediction equations for basal metabolic rate (BMR) are not fully applicable to Chinese adults, particularly for those with a high body mass index (BMI). A new equation was developed in this study using data from 121 men and 111 women in China, and it showed better accuracy compared to existing equations. The new equation is: BMR (kJ/d) = 52.6 x weight (kg) + 828 x gender + 1960 (women = 0, men = 1). The accuracy rate for this equation was 78% for the whole range of BMI and 76% for those with a BMI"}
{"answers": "This preliminary study demonstrated that OSCE ratings by LEs and REs were reasonably comparable when using checklists. Remote examination may be a feasible and acceptable way of assessing students' clinical skills, but further validity evidence will be required before it can be recommended for use in high-stakes examinations.", "prediction_text": "Yes, physician-examiners can participate in the objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) remotely, with a correlation in scores between local examiners (LEs) and remote examiners (REs) found in several stations."}
{"answers": "ACR is an independent prognostic factor for maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes in suspected preeclampsia. ACR may be useful to inform risk predictions within a prognostic model.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the first urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) in women with suspected preeclampsia is a prognostic factor for both maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes. The study found that a higher ACR was associated with an increased odds of adverse maternal and neonatal composite outcomes, as well as with reduced gestational age at delivery, in multivariate analysis."}
{"answers": "The effect on venous pressures caused by the change in patient positioning alone during liver surgery does not affect the risk of venous air embolism.", "prediction_text": "No, patient position during liver surgery does not influence the risk of venous air embolism."}
{"answers": "The observations from this study provide limited support for the possibility that occupational arsenic exposure could play a role in the development of diabetes mellitus. Many other metallic compounds are also used in art glass production, however, and there is a possibility of confounding.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found an increased risk of diabetes mellitus among Swedish art glass workers, particularly among those who were exposed to arsenic in their work. The odds ratio for diabetes mellitus among glassworks employees was 1.2, with a higher risk observed among those who were exposed to arsenic in combination with cardiovascular disease. The highest risk was found among unspecified glass workers, who were probably exposed to high levels of arsenic."}
{"answers": "Hospital preparedness can be better defined by a fixed number of casualties rather than a percentile of its bed capacity. Only 20% of the arriving casualties will require immediate medical treatment. Implementation of this concept may improve the utilisation of national emergency health resources both in the preparation phase and on real time.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the current readiness guidelines for hospitals in Israel, which recommend allocating 20% of bed capacity for multiple casualty incidents, are not sufficient to meet the demands of HMCIs. The study found that the mean number of casualties arriving at a single hospital was 20.8, with a range of 4-56, and the majority of HMCIs (95%) had a casualty load of less than 52. Additionally, 79.2% of casualties did not require immediate medical treatment based on severity scores and emergency department discharges. Therefore, the study suggests that the current readiness gu"}
{"answers": "While Italian primary care physicians appropriately target eradication therapy for H pylori infection in patients with peptic ulcer disease rather than nonulcer disease, the intervention was still underused in these patients. Improvements in this prescribing behavior are needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that primary care physicians underprescribe antibiotics for peptic ulcer disease (PUD). Of the 6866 patients included in the study, only 690 (10%) received eradication therapy, with a significantly lower proportion of patients with PUD (27.6%) compared to non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD, 2%). Additionally, there was a significant difference in the frequency of eradication therapy between patients with a definitive diagnosis (37.7%) and those with a presumptive diagnosis (20.3%)."}
{"answers": "When cerebral hemispherectomy is performed to control seizures associated with very early (in utero) insult, it has been found that the remaining right hemisphere is still able to support reading and phonological processing skills that are normally mediated by the left hemisphere. Our results also suggest the existence of variability in individuals after hemispherectomy, even within groups having the same etiology and similar timing of insult.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the isolated right hemisphere can read. In this study, 60% of participants developed both word reading and paragraph reading in the average range, despite the fact that the left hemisphere was removed in the cerebral hemispherectomy. Additionally, phonological awareness levels were unexpectedly spared in the majority of participants, and phonological awareness levels strongly correlated with word reading. Verbal memory and receptive vocabulary size, which are components of phonological processing skills, also positively correlated with reading levels, similar to those reported in average readers."}
{"answers": "Improved office-based practices regarding influenza vaccination could significantly impact Healthy People 2020 goals by increasing influenza vaccine uptake and reducing corresponding racial and ethnic disparities.", "prediction_text": "Yes, routine offering of influenza vaccination in office-based settings can reduce racial and ethnic disparities in adult influenza vaccination.

{"answers": "The SPI was accurate in predicting the presence or absence of esophageal varices in patients with compensated cirrhosis.", "prediction_text": "Yes, non-invasive diagnosis of esophageal varices in patients with compensated hepatic cirrhosis is possible by duplex Doppler ultrasonography. The study found that the splenic index (SPI) is the most accurate parameter for predicting the presence of esophageal varices, with a cut-off value of SPI at 5.0 offering the highest diagnostic accuracy. The study also showed that among patients with SPI <5.0, the absence of esophageal varices could be correctly diagnosed in 27 out of 28 patients without invasive screening endoscopy, with a high negative predictive value and sens"}
{"answers": "This study showed for the first time that RALP induces lower tissue trauma than RRP.", "prediction_text": "Yes, robotically assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) is less invasive than retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP) based on the increase in inflammatory markers (IL-6 and CRP) during surgery. The study found that RALP led to higher levels of IL-6 and CRP at various time points after surgery compared to RRP, indicating a less invasive surgical impact on the body."}
{"answers": "The researchers studied a defined skin care protocol using a cleanser with aloe vera and a cleansing lotion, followed by application of either a moisture barrier with silicone or skin protectant with zinc oxide and menthol, undertaken at two different frequencies. Data revealed the incidence of moderate IAD was decreased in the experimental group (receiving the skin protocol every 6 hours and p.r.n.).", "prediction_text": "Yes, the frequency of skin care affects the severity of incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) in critically ill patients.

Larger studies are needed to validate these findings and to explore possible mechanisms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patient coaching can reduce racial/ethnic disparities in cancer pain control."}
{"answers": "The association between plasma glucose levels and CVD risk is mainly explained by insulin resistance, which raises the question of whether glucose lowering per se without changes in the processes that underlie hyperglycemia should be the sole clinical paradigm in the treatment of type 2 diabetes or its prevention.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that insulin resistance drives the association between hyperglycemia and cardiovascular risk. Adjusting for insulin sensitivity eliminated the association between fasting glucose and cardiovascular risk, and the association between 2-hour glucose and cardiovascular risk disappeared when adjusting for both insulin sensitivity and fasting glucose. Insulin sensitivity, on the other hand, remained significantly associated with cardiovascular risk after adjusting for glucose levels."}
{"answers": "Tracheobronchoscopy is a useful and safe procedure and should be recommended in tertiary centers for babies with EA before surgical repair.", "prediction_text": "Yes, preoperative tracheobronchoscopy (TBS) can be clinically useful in newborns with esophageal atresia (EA) in preventing complications and improving diagnosis and surgical treatment. In this study, TBS identified unsuspected fistulas and malformations of the respiratory tree in 3 of 9 type A patients and 4 patients with previously undetected malformations, respectively. Additionally, TBS occluded carinal fistulas in 14 type C patients to improve ventilation during repair, and no complications were observed. Overall, TBS was clinically useful in 28 (45.2"}
{"answers": "The recently released seventh edition of the primary tumor staging system for kidney tumors is a powerful predictor of CSS. However, some of the substages identified by the classification have overlapping prognoses, and other substages include patients with heterogeneous outcomes. The few modifications included in this edition may have not resolved the most critical issues in the previous version.", "prediction_text": "Yes, further improvements are needed in the 2009 TNM version for the staging system of kidney cancers. The study found that the novel classification of the primary tumor was a powerful independent predictor of cancer-specific survival (CSS) in multivariable analysis, but the subclassification of pT1 tumors did not retain an independent predictive role. Additionally, the study highlighted limitations such as retrospective design, lack of central pathologic review, and small number of patients included in some substages."}
{"answers": "The Young-Burgess system is useful for predicting transfusion requirements. For the system to predict mortality or nonorthopaedic injuries, fractures must be divided into stable (APC1, LC1) and unstable (APC2, APC3, LC2, LC3, VS, combined mechanism of injury) types. LC1 injuries are very common and not always benign (overall mortality rate, 8.2%).", "prediction_text": "Yes, the Young-Burgess classification system predicts mortality, transfusion requirements, and non-orthopaedic injuries in patients with pelvic ring fractures. The study found that the Young-Burgess system was able to differentiate between different types of fractures based on their severity, with lateral compression fractures (LC1, LC2, and LC3) having lower transfusion requirements than anteroposterior compression fractures (APC1, APC2, and APC3), and vertical shear fractures (VS) having the highest transfusion requirements. The system was also able to predict mortality rates, with stable f"}

The study found that the cumulative primary patency rate was 60.3% at 1 year and 48.4% at 3 years, and the limb salvage rate was 68.6% at 1 and 3 years."}
{"answers": "Although the SLBM is quite repeatable, it underestimates mesopic pupil size and shows a too wide range of agreement with CIP. SLBM shows low sensitivity in detecting pupils larger than 6\u00a0mm, which may be misleading when planning anterior segment surgery. Previous grading-consensus training strategies may increase interrater reproducibility, and compensation for the systematic underestimation could improve accuracy of the SLBM.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the cobalt blue light slit-lamp biomicroscopy method (SLBM) can measure mesopic pupil size. The study found that the mean pupil diameter measured with SLBM was 5.81 \u00b1 0.70 mm, which was significantly smaller than the mean pupil diameter measured with Colvard infrared pupillometry (CIP) (6.26 \u00b1 0.68 mm, p = 0.01).

{"answers": "There was little evidence that people at high risk of falls received systematic falls risk assessment during rehabilitation. When a risk was identified, generally a strategy was implemented. However, failure to assess some risk factors might have limited fall prevention strategies offered. Failure to adequately address risks during hospitalization could contribute to falls post-discharge. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2016; 16: 570-576.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that discharge documentation did not correctly identify falls risk for most patients at high risk of falls. Only 9 out of 50 patients had their falls risk correctly identified in their discharge documentation. Additionally, there was limited assessment of falls risk factors such as osteoporosis, footwear, and visual assessment in the previous 2 years. Only 65% of patients received a median of 6.5 out of 16 possible fall prevention strategies."}
{"answers": "Although most Medicare beneficiaries who received a new CIED between 2005 and 2009 did not have an initial in-person CIED follow-up visit within 2 to 12 weeks after device implantation, the rate of initial follow-up improved appreciably over time. This CIED follow-up visit was significantly more common in white patients than in patients of other races.", "prediction_text": "Experts' recommendations for follow-up of patients with new cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) are not fully implemented in routine clinical practice, with significant racial disparities in the frequency of in-person visits within the first 12 weeks after implantation."}
{"answers": "According to our study, there is a great variability when different brands and models of scanners are compared directly.

{"answers": "Ophthalmic pathology and basic science research show that SBK and ASA are improvements in excimer laser keratorefractive surgery compared to conventional LASIK or PRK, particularly with regard to maintaining corneal biomechanics and perhaps moderately reducing the risk of corneal haze. However, most of the disadvantages caused by wound healing issues remain.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a difference in the biomechanical and wound healing characteristics of corneas after excimer laser keratorefractive surgery between advanced surface ablation (ASA) and sub-Bowman's keratomileusis (SBK). The study found that ASA resulted in a stronger and more rigid cornea, particularly in the anterior and peripheral regions, compared to SBK. This suggests that ASA may be biomechanically safer than SBK in reducing the risk of keratectasia after surgery. However, both techniques still have some disadvantages due to inadequate reparative wound healing in the adult human"}

Thus, ultrasound can be used as an adequate alternative method to X-ray for pediatric fracture diagnosis.", "prediction_text": "No, ultrasound is not equal to X-ray in pediatric fracture diagnosis. While ultrasound was superior to X-ray in the detection of dislocation, X-ray had some advantages in the detection of fracture type."}
{"answers": "Although initial infection control rate was substantially lower in the retention group than the removal group, final results were comparable at latest followup. We believe retention treatment can be selectively considered for non-S. aureus infection, and when applied in selected patients, polyethylene exchange should be performed.", "prediction_text": "No, implant retention cannot be recommended for the treatment of infected TKA based on the study's findings. While the infection control rate was lower in the retention group compared to the removal group after initial surgical treatment, the difference was not statistically significant and the overall infection control rate was still relatively low (31% in retention group and 59% in removal group). Additionally, the study found that type of treatment (retention versus removal) was the only factor associated with infection control, and within the retention group, Staphylococcus aureus infection and polyethylene nonexchange were contributing factors for failure of infection control. These find"}
{"answers": "The observed socioeconomic, demographic and microbiological differences between unmarried and married women could be responsible for the poor pregnancy outcome among unmarried pregnant women in Poland. Unmarried pregnant women should be covered by comprehensive medical care even before pregnancy. Further studies taking into account the role of psychological stress, patterns of sexual behavior and substance abuse during pregnancy could help identify the factors responsible for adverse pregnancy outcome among unmarried pregnant women.", "prediction_text": "Yes, microbiological factors, specifically the presence of Mycoplasma hominis, were found to be a risk factor for poor pregnancy outcome among unmarried pregnant women in Poland."}

The optimal approach is actually unknown, and guidelines comparing follow-up protocols have not been established. Prospective cost-effectiveness studies are needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, different follow-up modalities can play a role in the diagnosis of asymptomatic endometrial cancer relapses. The study found that among 165 asymptomatic patients, 60 (36.4%) were detected through clinical visits alone, 103 (62.4%) through imaging, and 2 (1.2%) through cytologic examination. The study suggests that a combination of different follow-up modalities may be more effective in detecting asymptomatic relapses than relying on a single modality."}
{"answers": "Lower Infundibular height could be a good measurement tool for deciding which patients with lower calyceal lithiasis would benefit from SWL treatment. Height of less than 22 mm suggests a good outcome from lithotripsy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, infundibular height can predict the clearance of lower pole calyceal stones after extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy."}
{"answers": "The interval from the onset of clinical symptoms to the initial surgical intervention seems to be the most important prognostic factor with a significant impact on outcome. Despite extensive therapeutic efforts, Fournier's gangrene remains a surgical emergency and early recognition with prompt radical debridement is the mainstays of management.", "prediction_text": "Yes, Fournier's gangrene is still a dangerous condition. The study found that the mortality rate among patients with Fournier's gangrene was 36%, despite the use of antibiotics and aggressive debridement. The leukocyte count was found to be significantly higher in the group of patients who died compared to those who survived, indicating that this may be a useful prognostic indicator of mortality."}
{"answers": "These four cases may belong to a variant form of HAM/TSP, predominantly involving the cervical cord levels.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the article suggests that chronic progressive cervical myelopathy can be a variant form of HTLV-I-associated myelopathy (HAM)/tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP). The study found that four patients with HTLV-I infection developed slowly progressive myelopathy with abnormal MRI lesions in the cervical cord levels, and two of the patients showed high risk of developing HAM/TSP in virologic and immunologic aspects."}
{"answers": "The results of the current study demonstrated that there are factors that increase the risk of a leakage which would enable surgeons to define risk groups, to more carefully select patients, and to offer a closer follow-up during the postoperative course with early recognition and adequate treatment.

{"answers": "Local anesthesia is not required to lower a patient's pain intensity when applying intra-articular contrast media for MR arthrography of the shoulder. This could result in reduced costs and a reduced risk of adverse reactions, without an impact on patient comfort.", "prediction_text": "No, local anesthesia is not necessary for MR arthrography (MRa) of the shoulder, as there was no significant difference in pain intensity between patients who received local anesthesia and those who did not, according to this study."}
{"answers": "A routinely inserted ENBD tube did not improve the clinical course, despite patients having to endure increased procedure time and discomfort, and the insertion would therefore be unnecessary.", "prediction_text": "No, it is not necessary to insert a nasobiliary drainage tube routinely after endoscopic clearance of the common bile duct in patients with choledocholithiasis-induced cholangitis. The study found that there was no significant difference in the recurrence rate of cholangitis or length of hospital stay between patients who received an endoscopic nasobiliary drainage (ENBD) tube and those who did not. However, the procedure time and discomfort score were higher in the ENBD group."}
{"answers": "Regarding the pedigree, we discuss different modes of inheritance. The presence of consanguineous unions in this family suggests the possibility of a common ancestor and thus a recessive autosomal mode of inheritance.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is an inheritance pattern of nasal polyposis (NP) in this family. According to the study, 19.7% of individuals older than 17 years were affected by NP within the family, which is significantly higher than the national French prevalence of 2.1%."}
{"answers": "Emergency DBE is feasible, safe and effective in acute OGIB and may avoid major surgery, diagnosing and successfully treating most patients. Combined approach with RT viewing by CE is especially useful to identify recurrent bleeding vascular lesions such as DL that may be easily misdiagnosed by non-emergency DBE.", "prediction_text": "Yes, emergency double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) combined with real-time viewing of capsule endoscopy (CE) is a feasible combined approach in acute overt-obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB). The study found that emergency DBE in patients with overt severe bleeding was more effective in detecting Dieulafoy's lesions (DL) than DBE performed 24 hours after symptom onset, and the combined approach with RT viewing by CE correctly modified DBE management in four patients."}
{"answers": "Laparoscopic antireflux surgery significantly improved quality of life in reflux patients whose symptoms were well controlled on medical therapy. Although on the basis of a noncomparative trial with a relatively short follow-up period, we believe such patients should be considered for laparoscopic antireflux surgery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, laparoscopic antireflux surgery improves quality of life in patients with well-controlled gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) who prefer surgery over continued medical therapy. The study found significant improvements in physical, mental, and gastrointestinal symptom scores on generic quality-of-life questionnaires (Short Form 36 and Psychological General Well-Being index) and a gastrointestinal symptom questionnaire (Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale) after surgery compared to preoperative scores."}
{"answers": "Patients in regional and rural settings were willing partners in developing skills of junior medical students, who had greater involvement in patient consultations than previously reported for urban students. Our study extends the findings from urban general practice that patients are underutilised partners in community-based medical training. The support of patients from regional and rural settings could facilitate the expansion of primary care-based medical education in these areas of workforce need.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the majority of patients in rural and regional Australia are willing participants in community-based medical education, with 99% of patients in the study consenting to medical student involvement in their consultations and feeling that they play an important role in the teaching process. While some patients initially expressed reluctance to allow students to conduct certain aspects of the consultation independently, most patients reported being willing to accept higher levels of involvement after the consultation."}
{"answers": "Overall, in a US Air Force population, OSA does not predict a decrease in aerobic fitness as measured by cycle ergometry. However, patients with an apnea-hypopnea index of greater than 20 have a statistically significant decrease in aerobic fitness compared to the normal population. This study demonstrates the effects of OSA on aerobic fitness. Further correlation of fitness testing results with OSA severity and treatment is needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with decreased aerobic fitness, as demonstrated by a lower maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max) compared to a normal population. This decrease in VO2max is significant in patients with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of greater than 20."}
{"answers": "Pictorial HWLs with didactic textual forms seem to work better than those with testimonial narratives. Future research should determine which pictorial HWL content has the greatest real-world impact among consumers from disadvantaged groups, including assessment of how HWL content should change to maintain its impact as tobacco control environments strengthen and consumer awareness of smoking-related risks increases.", "prediction_text": "Yes, pictorial warning labels on cigarette packages can address smoking-related health disparities, particularly among individuals with higher levels of education. Didactic textual forms and graphic imagery of diseased organs were found to be more effective in increasing perceived credibility, relevance, and impact compared to testimonial narratives and human suffering imagery, respectively. These findings suggest that pictorial warning labels can be an effective tool in reducing smoking rates and addressing smoking-related health disparities among different subgroups of the population."}
{"answers": "Preferential transmission of AVPR1A to hypersexual or uninhibited people-seeking probands was not supported.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no significant evidence to suggest that the arginine vasopressin V1a receptor microsatellites are related to hypersexuality in children with a prepubertal and early adolescent bipolar disorder phenotype. The study found no preferential transmission of the number of AVPR1A microsatellite repeats to hypersexual and uninhibited people-seeking probands, and no significant associations between hypersexuality or uninhibited people-seeking and the number of AVPR1A GATA or complex repeats."}
{"answers": "We suggest that regardless of family history, all children over 5 years should be screened for hyperlipidemia. Education about hyperlipidemia and precautions for its complications should be given to both children and families. The best and easiest way to reach children is to screen them at schools. School is also a good place for education of children about hyperlipidemia and risk factors.", "prediction_text": "No, family history is not a reliable indicator for cholesterol screening in school children. Despite 64.4% of the subjects reporting a family history of hyperlipidemia, no relations between family history and serum lipid levels were found."}
{"answers": "These data indicate digoxin use may be associated with a reduction in risk of PCa.

{"answers": "GHD men receiving GH treatment have a mortality rate not different from the background population. In women, after exclusion of high-risk patients, mortality was not different from the background population except for CVD. Mortality due to malignancies was not elevated in adults receiving GH treatment. Next to gender, the heterogeneous etiology is of influence on mortality in GHD adults with GH treatment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, growth hormone replacement therapy (GHRT) reduces mortality in adults with growth hormone deficiency (GHD). The study found that patients in the treatment group had a standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of 1.27 compared to the expected mortality, indicating a 27% reduction in mortality. This reduction was primarily observed in women, with a 3-fold increase in CVD mortality. Sex, GHD onset, age, and underlying diagnosis were identified as influencing factors."}
{"answers": "It seems quite admissible and justified to encourage medical students to officiate as examiners in undergraduate emergency medicine OSCE formative testing, but not necessarily in summative assessment evaluations.", "prediction_text": "Yes, student examiners can be a reasonable substitute for faculty examiners in an undergraduate OSCE on medical emergencies, as students in the SE track performed significantly better in certain stations and overall compared to the FE track. However, the effect sizes were generally small, suggesting that faculty examiners may still provide more comprehensive and accurate assessments."}
{"answers": "Expression of ER is a constitutional feature of the connective tissue and smooth muscle cells of the anal continence organ. Estrogen receptors and PR are not detectable in the striated muscle fibers of the external anal sphincter in either sex. The presence of ER in the stroma and smooth muscles of the anal canal suggests that these tissues are targets for estrogen. This constitutes a theoretical basis for the beneficial effects of estrogen and progestin replacement on anal continence in postmenopausal women.", "prediction_text": "The presence of hormone receptors in the tissues of the anal canal, specifically estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR), is associated with a higher likelihood of anal incontinence in women. The study found that ER was present in the smooth muscle cells of the internal sphincter of all female patients and in a significant proportion of male patients, while PR was only found in a small number of male patients. The presence of these receptors suggests that hormonal influences may play a role in the development of anal incontinence in women, and that immunohistochemical assessment of these receptors may be a"}
{"answers": "In women with bothersome MUI, concomitant AA repair does not result in additional improvement in OAB symptoms over MUS alone. Patients with postoperative complications exhibit less improvement in OAB symptoms.", "prediction_text": "No, concomitant anterior/apical repair during midurethral sling does not improve the overactive bladder component of mixed incontinence. The study found that the OAB-q SS change score was similar between the MUS-only and MUS + AA repair groups (30 \u00b1 26 vs 25 \u00b1 25, p = 0.20)."}

{"answers": "The use of US helps in making a correct diagnosis and in the follow-up with objective criteria and also convinces the patient and the family that the treatment needs to be continued.", "prediction_text": "Yes, ultrasound can be used for the diagnosis and follow-up of constipation in children. The study found that ultrasound measurements of rectal diameter and anterior wall thickness can be used to objectively diagnose constipation and monitor response to treatment. A rectal diameter of 2.44 cm or less can be used as a cutoff point for diagnosis, with a sensitivity of 71% and specificity of 76%. Additionally, the study showed that ultrasound can be used to assess fecal load in the rectum and sigmoid colon, which can be a useful indicator of treatment response."}
{"answers": "Brachytherapy with ruthenium applicators is an effective therapy for small- and medium-size posterior uveal melanomas. Our results are comparable to other series. The treatment outcome does not seem to be capable of improvement by increasing the apical dose. An internationally accepted model for defining the dosage in brachytherapy is needed.", "prediction_text": "The escalation of the apical dose from 100 to 160 Gy in the beta-radiation of posterior choroidal melanomas with 106Ru plaques did not significantly improve treatment outcomes."}
{"answers": "The addition of epinephrine to ACLS-SAPO increases vital organ perfusion pressures and improves outcome from cardiac arrest. There appears to be a profound loss of arterial vasomotor tone after prolonged arrest. This loss of vasomotor tone may make exogenous pressors necessary for resuscitation after prolonged cardiac arrest.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that a pressor (epinephrine) is necessary during aortic perfusion and oxygenation therapy (SAPO) of cardiac arrest. The study found that the use of epinephrine during SAPO resulted in higher aortic pressures and a greater increase in coronary perfusion pressure compared to the use of saline placebo. Specifically, the mean aortic relaxation pressure increased by 58+/-5 mm Hg in animals that had received epinephrine versus 20+/-11 mm Hg in those that had received saline placebo, and the coronary perfusion pressure during infusion increased by 52+/-"}
{"answers": "In a leading specialty journal, cited reviewers gave higher scores than noncited reviewers. However, this\u00a0was likely due to their being assigned higher-quality manuscripts and not because they were cited in the manuscript. Reviewer requests that their work be cited were rare.", "prediction_text": "Yes, reviewers' scores are influenced by citations to their own work. The study found that manuscripts that contained citations to the reviewer's work received higher evaluations than those that did not, and reviewers were more likely to suggest adding citations to their own work than to other work. The adjusted odds ratio in the final regression model was 1.4, indicating that manuscripts with citations to the reviewer's work had a 40% higher desirability score than those without."}
{"answers": "Preoperative education delivered by nurses reduced anxiety and postoperative complications of patients undergoing cardiac surgery, but it was not effective in reducing readmissions or length of stay.", "prediction_text": "Yes, nurse-led preoperative education can reduce anxiety and postoperative complications of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The study found that patients who received preoperative education had lower levels of state anxiety on the day before surgery and during the follow-up period compared to the control group. Additionally, the intervention group had a lower proportion of chest infections. Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that education and trait anxiety scale score on admission were independent predictors of a reduction in state anxiety."}
{"answers": "Improving hospital efficiency by shortening length of stay does not appear to result in increased rates of readmission or numbers of physician visits within 30 days after discharge from hospital. Research is needed to identify optimal lengths of stay and expected readmission rates.", "prediction_text": "No significant correlation was found between decreasing lengths of stay and adverse effects on quality of care, such as increased readmission rates or mean number of physician visits, for any of the four diagnostic categories studied (AMI, bronchitis or asthma, TURP, and uterine or adnexal procedures) in Winnipeg hospitals over the 4-year study period."}
{"answers": "Solitary kidney in a canine model is more resistant to ischemia than paired kidneys based on radiological, pathological and genetic evidence.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that a solitary kidney is not more resistant to warm ischemia compared to a paired kidney. In fact, the study showed that the solitary kidney was more susceptible to damage, with a greater reduction in clearance and more pronounced tubular necrosis compared to the paired kidney. Additionally, the expression of proinflammatory markers was higher and more sustained in the solitary kidney group."}

We conclude that further, comparative, more comprehensive, long-term, and controlled studies are required.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that 3-phase bone scintigraphy can be a useful method in determining the level of amputation in diabetic foot patients. The study found a high accuracy rate in determining the amputation level using scintigraphy, with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 90%. Additionally, the study found that scintigraphy was able to identify amputation levels that were not visible on Doppler ultrasound. Therefore, the study suggests that scintigraphy can be a valuable tool in determining the level of amputation in diabetic foot patients, and may be a useful guideline method in this regard."}
{"answers": "At baseline assessment patients of lower socioeconomic status showed lower health related quality of life. Since there was no clear trend at follow-up assessment this suggests that patients from different socioeconomic status responded to treatment similarly. In general, the findings suggest that quality of life is not only the outcome of the disease and its treatment, but is also highly dependent on each patients' socioeconomic characteristics.", "prediction_text": "Yes, socioeconomic status (SES) matters in quality of life (QoL) in lung cancer patients. At baseline, patients of lower SES had more health problems, less functioning, and more symptoms compared to affluent patients. However, there was no significant difference between patient groups at follow-up."}
{"answers": "General surgery research residents' intraoperative leadership skills showed significant correlations to their perceptions of skill decay and task difficulty during a bowel repair. Evaluating resident's directional instructions may provide an additional individualized intraoperative assessment metric. Further evaluation relating to operative performance outcomes is warranted.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that residents' leadership skills, as measured by the number of directional instructions given during the simulated small bowel repair, were related to their ratings of technical skill. Specifically, residents who gave more instructions to their assistant tended to have lower ratings of perceived difficulty in selecting the correct suture, suture pattern, and completing the entire surgical task, and higher ratings of self-efficacy in their intraoperative decision-making and small bowel repair skills."}
{"answers": "The severity of TAI is influenced by the sharpness of the aortic arch. There is an inverse relationship between the severity of aortic injury and the aortic arch index.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the anatomy of the aortic arch influences the severity of traumatic aortic injury (TAI).

{"answers": "The results showed no overall first night effect on severity of RMMA frequency in young and healthy patients with SB. In clinical practice, one-night sleep recording may be sufficient for moderate-high frequency SB patients. However, low RMMA frequency in the first night could be confirmed by a second night based on the patient's medical and dental history.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a first night effect on sleep bruxism. The study found that the second night showed significantly higher burst index, bruxism time index, and mean burst duration compared to the first night. Additionally, five patients in the low frequency group shifted to the moderate-high frequency group on the second night, while only one patient in the moderate-high frequency group shifted to the low frequency group."}
{"answers": "Athletes engaged in competitive sports are more likely to develop ventricular arrhythmias during exercise. These arrhythmias subside over time when athletes are engaged in non-competitive sports.", "prediction_text": "Yes, ventricular arrhythmias in athletes tend to subside over time. The study found that among athletes who experienced ventricular arrhythmias during an initial exercise test, the majority had fewer or no arrhythmias during a repeat exercise test performed after a mean follow-up period of 70 months."}

{"answers": "We conclude that patient and graft survival on transplanting kidneys from elderly donors to young recipients is superimposable on that obtained with young donors. However, renal function is better in the group of young donors.", "prediction_text": "Yes, it is appropriate to implant kidneys from elderly donors in young recipients. The study found no significant differences in survival rates, graft function, or complications between the two groups at 1, 5, or 10 years after transplantation. However, there was a significant difference in creatinine levels between the two groups at 1, 5, and 10 years after transplantation, with the elderly donor group having higher creatinine levels."}
{"answers": "Many patients do not understand their ED care or their discharge instructions. Moreover, most patients appear to be unaware of their lack of understanding and report inappropriate confidence in their comprehension and recall.", "prediction_text": "No, patients are not aware of when they do not understand their emergency department care and instructions. In this study, 78% of patients demonstrated deficient comprehension in at least one domain, but only 20% of them perceived difficulty with comprehension."}
{"answers": "The results of this study suggest that normothermic CPB does not prevent the development of the \"euthyroid sick syndrome\" during and after CPB. Despite these changes in thyroid function, most patients in both groups had a normal postoperative recovery.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the temperature during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) does not have a significant effect on the development of postoperative euthyroid sick syndrome (ESS)."}
{"answers": "Severe hypoglycaemia is associated with an increased risk for CV outcomes in people at high CV risk and dysglycaemia. Although allocation to insulin glargine vs. standard care was associated with an increased risk of severe and non-severe hypoglycaemia, the relative risk of CV outcomes with hypoglycaemia was lower with insulin glargine-based glucose-lowering therapy than with the standard glycaemic control. Trial Registration (ORIGIN ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00069784).", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that severe hypoglycaemia is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, including the composite of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke, mortality, CV mortality, and arrhythmic death."}
{"answers": "EDWS is a safe and effective treatment for esophagogastric varices secondary to portal hypertension in selected patients. Patients treated with EDWS had a lower complication rate of portal venous system thrombosis compared with those treated with conventional MED.", "prediction_text": "Yes, esophagogastric devascularization without splenectomy (EDWS) is a safe and effective treatment for portal hypertension, with a lower morbidity rate of portal venous system thrombosis compared to the widely used modified esophagogastric devascularization (MED) with splenectomy."}

{"answers": "The general practice selection process is predictive of future performance in the MRCGP.", "prediction_text": "Yes, general practice selection scores predict success at MRCGP. The study found a statistically significant correlation between overall selection scores and examination performance in the AKT and CSA elements of the MRCGP."}
{"answers": "Although the association of prostate and lung cancer is uncommon, the possibility of synchronous tumors should be considered in patients with urinary and pulmonary symptoms suggestive of neoplasm. It is important to determine if the lesion is a metastasis, since the prognosis depends on the second tumor.", "prediction_text": "No, prostatic syndrome and pleural effusion are not different diseases. The paper is discussing an uncommon association of prostate and lung cancer, where both tumors were present in advanced stages and were found to be metastatic. The authors are analyzing the characteristics of both tumors, their association with tumors in other sites, and the time of presentation. They are not discussing prostatic syndrome and pleural effusion as separate diseases."}
{"answers": "The practice of intensive observation for the first transfusion in pediatric patients is probably unnecessary.", "prediction_text": "No, intensive monitoring during the first transfusion in pediatric patients is not necessary, as none of the 13 patients who experienced a mild reaction during their first transfusion required ICU management."}
