{"answers": "These data suggest that being willing and fit enough for a chemotherapy protocol is a good prognostic factor for invasive bladder cancer. This eligibility bias emphasizes the need for prospective, randomized trials, and indicates that single-group studies using historical or matched controls have to be interpreted with caution.", "prediction_text": "No, eligibility for a chemotherapy protocol is not a good prognostic factor for invasive bladder cancer after radical cystectomy. The study found that patients who were eligible for the chemotherapy protocol had a worse overall survival and recurrence-free survival compared to those who were not eligible, and a higher rate of cancer-related death."}
{"answers": "An additional delayed phase through the abdomen in routine contrast-enhanced CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis is of low yield, particularly if reliable follow-up imaging to further elucidate uncertain findings is available.", "prediction_text": "The study found that delayed imaging in routine CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis was not beneficial in the majority of cases (95.8%), with the most common incidental findings being liver hemangioma, adrenal adenoma, and parapelvic renal cysts. However, in 0.1% of cases, a renal mass was detected only on the delayed phase images. The additional radiation exposure from the delayed phase imaging resulted in a mean 59.5% increase in effective radiation dose. Therefore, the study suggests that the additional cost of radiation and time associated with delayed imaging may not be justified for routine CT exam"}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that the SCL 90-R is best viewed as an indicator of unidimensional emotional distress and somatic effects of structural brain injury.", "prediction_text": "No, the SCL 90-R obsessive-compulsive dimension does not identify cognitive impairments in individuals with brain tumors. The study found that the dimension was related to symptoms of depression, anxiety, and subjective complaints of memory problems, but not to objective measures of attention, verbal memory, or age."}
{"answers": "The results suggest that NA treatment can be stopped in selected patients with CHB as long as they are not cirrhotic, have completed a minimum period of treatment, have normal ALT and sustained undetectable DNA. These patients should be closely monitored during the first year and then indefinitely.", "prediction_text": "Yes, it is possible to stop treatment with nucleos(t)ide analogs in patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B, but the rate of virological relapse is high, with 54.54% of patients experiencing a relapse within 6 months after discontinuation."}
{"answers": "The results of this study do not support the hypothesis that there is a direct link between atmospheric pressure values and abdominal aortic aneurysm ruptures.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the diameter of the aneurysm is important in determining the influence of atmospheric pressure on aortic aneurysm rupture. The study found that larger aneurysms (>7 cm) had a higher rate of rupture, and this trend was more pronounced in patients with hypertension."}
{"answers": "Findings from these studies support discordance between device-recorded and self-reported hot flashes. In addition, the studies reveal further limitations of SSC monitoring, including difficulties with data collection and lack of consistency in interpretation. Based on these results and other recent trials identifying issues with SSC methodology, it is time to find a better physiologic surrogate measure for hot flashes.", "prediction_text": "No, the study concludes that sternal skin conductance is not a reasonable surrogate for hot flash measurement. The first prototype of the SSC device was unable to collect any analyzable data due to malfunction issues, and the second prototype revealed a low concordance rate between self-reported and device-recorded hot flashes. Therefore, the study suggests that sternal skin conductance is not a reliable measure of hot flashes."}
{"answers": ": Prophylactic fixation with a cephalomedullary nail was not found to be cost-effective for the average older woman who sustained a hip fracture. However, it may be appropriate for select patient populations. The study supports the need for basic science and clinical trials investigating the effectiveness of prophylactic fixation for patient populations at higher lifetime risk for contralateral hip fracture.", "prediction_text": "No, prophylactic fixation of the uninjured hip is not a cost-effective method to prevent a future contralateral fragility hip fracture in the majority of cases, according to the study. However, the study did find that prophylactic fixation may be cost-effective in certain subgroups of patients, such as women aged 71-75 years with a 30% greater relative risk for a contralateral fracture, and women younger than age 70 years. The cost-effectiveness of prophylactic fixation was found to be highly sensitive to the effectiveness and relative morbidity and mortality of the additional procedure."}
{"answers": "We found that USMLE Step 2, number of honors in medical school clerkships, and AOA membership demonstrated the strongest correlations with resident performance. Our goal in analyzing these data was to provide residency programs at large a sense of which criteria may be \"high yield\" in ranking applicants by analyzing data from within our own pool of residents. Similar studies across a broader scope of programs are warranted to confirm applicability of our findings. The continually emerging complexities of the field of orthopaedic surgery lend increasing importance to future work on the appropriate selection and training of orthopaedic residents.", "prediction_text": "Yes, preresidency selection criteria can predict performance in orthopaedic surgery residency. Specifically, objective measures of resident knowledge and performance, such as USMLE Step 2 scores and ABOS Part I scores, were moderately correlated with preresidency selection criteria. Subjective ratings by faculty, such as global evaluation scores and faculty rankings, were also influenced by preresidency selection criteria, with AOA membership being associated with higher scores in the global evaluation and interpersonal and communication skills subsection."}
{"answers": "In vitro fertilization outcome is strongly correlated with both maternal ages, basal cycle, day 3 follicle, stimulated hormone, and antral follicle assessment. Antral follicle assessment was a better predictor of in vitro fertilization outcome than were age or follicle stimulated hormone. Antral follicle assessment may provide a marker for ovarian age that is distinct from chronological age or hormonal markers.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that baseline antral follicle assessment is a better predictor of in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcome than age and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). The clinical pregnancy rate was significantly higher in the group with baseline antral follicle >6 compared to those with antral follicle <or = 6, even after controlling for patient age and basal FSH levels. Additionally, the cancellation rate was significantly higher in the group with baseline antral follicle <or = 6 compared to those with antral follicle >or = 6. These findings suggest"}
{"answers": "Neither insertion of PEG tubes nor timing of insertion affect survival.", "prediction_text": "No, feeding tube insertion and its timing do not improve survival in advanced cognitive impairment patients with dementia and new problems eating."}
{"answers": "In this well established early discharge program with nurse home visits, newborn metabolic screening is not compromised by early discharge.", "prediction_text": "Yes, early discharge with nurse home visits affects the adequacy of newborn metabolic screening. The study found that early discharge infants had a higher rate of initial filter paper specimens being inadequate (22.9%) compared to traditional stay infants (14.3%, P<.0001), but had a higher rate of repeat specimens when the initial specimen was inadequate (85.0% early discharge vs 75.3% traditional stay, P=.002). Additionally, the early discharge group was more likely to have an adequate specimen within the first 9 days of life (1"}
{"answers": "The palliative treatment concept of 25\u00a0Gy applied in 5\u00a0fractions is sufficient for radiation of lung cancer, given that there was no obvious survival improvement in patients treated with the higher total dose regimen.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that high-dose radiotherapy (50 Gy in 20 fractions) did not significantly improve overall survival in palliative lung cancer patients compared to low-dose radiotherapy (25 Gy in 5 fractions), in both the overall population and in patients with a good-fair overall condition."}
{"answers": "Although elevated leukocyte count and CRP value cannot effectively establish the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the elderly, unelevated values exclude it. Accordingly, appendectomy is not recommended to be performed in an elderly patient with unelevated leukocyte count and CRP value, although clinical symptoms and signs indicate acute appendicitis.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that there is no significant difference in leukocyte counts or CRP values between patients with an uninflamed appendix and those with acute appendicitis in the elderly population. Therefore, leukocyte and CRP measurements do not have a role in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in this age group."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrates that in patients at risk for cardiac morbidity undergoing vascular surgery, desflurane is effective to control intraoperative hypertension without fear of major cardiac depressant effect.", "prediction_text": "Yes, desflurane alters left ventricular function when used to control surgical stimulation during aortic surgery. According to the study, the addition of desflurane to restore blood pressure during hypertension resulted in an increase in systemic vascular resistance, end-systolic wall stress, and left ventricular stroke work index, indicating a negative impact on left ventricular function."}
{"answers": "Development of tolerance to gluten seems possible in some patients with CD. Further follow-up will show whether this tolerance is permanent or only a long-term return to latency. This feature may be associated with genetic characteristics, especially with HLA genotypes that differ from DQ2 or DQ8. More insight into the mechanisms of the development of gluten tolerance may help to distinguish those CD patients that might not require life-long GFD.", "prediction_text": "The study found that only 2% of adult patients with celiac disease (CD) were able to develop tolerance to gluten, defined as no immunological or histological signs of CD while consuming gluten, after 20 years of diagnosis."}
{"answers": "No home-prepared replacement milks in South Africa meet all estimated micronutrient and essential fatty acid requirements of infants aged<6 months. Commercial infant formula is the only replacement milk that meets all nutritional needs. Revisions of WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF HIV and infant feeding course replacement milk options are needed. If replacement milks are to provide total nutrition, preparations should include vegetable oils, such as soybean oil, as a source of linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids, and additional vitamins and minerals.", "prediction_text": "No, the WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF-recommended replacement milks for infants of HIV-infected mothers are not appropriate in the South African context. The study found that the replacement milks provided inadequate amounts of certain micronutrients, including vitamins E and C, folic acid, iodine, and selenium, and did not meet the minimum recommended levels of linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid. Additionally, the preparation times and costs of the home-prepared replacement milks were found to be more feasible and affordable than the commercial formula. Overall, the study suggests that the WHO/UNAID"}
{"answers": "We have shown that eosinophilic inflammation of the airway wall may increase PD and that the association of eosinophil counts with ICSs may result in lessening the PD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) affect the perception of dyspnea during bronchoconstriction in asthma patients. The study found that in patients with obstruction who were treated with ICSs, eosinophil counts and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) were negatively associated with the perception of dyspnea (PD), while in patients who were ICS-naive, eosinophil counts were positively associated with PD."}
{"answers": "High socioeconomic status was associated with a higher acceptance rate of preventive home visits, but the association was attenuated by invitational procedures. The results indicate that the social inequality in acceptance of publicly offered preventive services might decrease if municipalities adopt more proactive invitational procedures.", "prediction_text": "Yes, acceptance rates of a national preventive home visit program for older people are socially imbalanced, with older people with high financial assets more likely to accept the program compared to those with low financial assets. However, the association was attenuated when adjusted by the invitational procedures used by the municipalities."}
{"answers": "In the present study, FT and androstenedione were statistically significantly correlated with sexual desire in the total cohort of women. ADT-G did not correlate more strongly than circulating androgens with sexual desire and is therefore not superior to measuring circulating androgens by mass spectrometry.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a correlation between androgens and sexual desire in women. The study found that sexual desire correlated with circulating androgens, including total testosterone (TT), calculated free testosterone (FT), androstenedione, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), in both the total cohort of women and in a subgroup of women aged 25-44 years who did not use systemic hormonal contraception. Additionally, androstenedione was found to be specifically correlated with sexual desire in women aged 45-65 years. However, no correlation was identified between the primary androgen metabolite androster"}
{"answers": "The results of these analyses suggest that marginally higher rates of depression to age 35 amongst the comorbid MD/AUD group were explained by increased exposure to adverse childhood circumstances amongst members of the comorbid group. Adolescent MD/AUD comorbidity is likely to be a risk marker, rather than a causal factor in subsequent MD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that comorbidity between major depression (MD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD) in adolescence is associated with poorer outcomes of depression in adulthood. Specifically, the study found that individuals who experienced comorbid MD/AUD during adolescence had higher rates of adult MD compared to those who only experienced MD or AUD during that period. However, after adjusting for confounding factors such as gender, childhood behavior problems, and exposure to abuse, the difference in rates of adult MD between the MD-only and MD/AUD groups was no longer statistically significant."}
{"answers": "There are no statistically apparent motion differences between SUP-CTV and INF-CTV. Current uniform planning target volume (PTV) margins are adequate to cover both portions of the CTV.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no statistically significant difference in target motion between the superior and inferior portions of the clinical target volume (PB-CTV) in any direction."}
{"answers": "Combined end points for adverse events are acceptable in the octogenarian. Carotid endarterectomy remains the gold standard for treatment of extracranial carotid disease in all age groups. Age alone should not place patients in the high-risk category for carotid endarterectomy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that octogenarians (age 80-89) are at high risk for carotid endarterectomy. The study found that 43% of patients had symptomatic carotid stenosis and 57% had asymptomatic carotid stenosis, which are both indications for carotid endarterectomy. Additionally, the study found that 17% of patients had diabetes mellitus, 76% had hypertension, 28% had coronary artery disease, 39% had hyperlipidemia, and 42% had a history of smoking, which are all risk"}
{"answers": "Lysosomotropic amines in combination with cyclosporine appear to be synergistic in the suppression of T-cell proliferation to MiHC and MHC. Use of chloroquine in combination with cyclosporine may result in improved control of GVHD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, synergy exists between lysosomotropic amines and cyclosporine in immunosuppressing T-cell responses to minor and major histocompatibility antigens. The study found that combination therapy with chloroquine and cyclosporine resulted in additive or synergistic suppression of T-cell responses to minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHC) and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in mice."}
{"answers": "The results of this study suggest that the cardiovascular response to exercise training may be different in men and women. Women may benefit more from interventions aimed to increase physical activity as a tool for prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.", "prediction_text": "Yes, exercise training has a significant effect on heart rate and QT interval in healthy young individuals, with trained individuals showing lower heart rates and higher heart rate variability compared to sedentary subjects. Additionally, there are gender differences in the effects of exercise training on the QT/RR slope, with a more pronounced effect in women. Exercise training reduced the QT/RR slope in both genders, but the effect was more marked in women, leading to a loss of the gender difference in ventricular repolarization duration at low heart rates."}
{"answers": "Although BD is correlated with GCS at presentation and RTS, it is not a reliable prognostic marker for outcome and mortality in patients with isolated TBI.", "prediction_text": "No, base deficit does not predict mortality in patients with severe traumatic brain injury."}
{"answers": "\"Aquagenic maladies\" could be a pediatric form of the aquagenic urticaria.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the research paper suggests that syncope during bathing in infants may be a form of water-induced urticaria, specifically aquagenic urticaria. The study found that all six infants in the study had dermographism, and there was an increase in blood histamine levels after a trial bath in two of the infants. The evolution of the \"aquagenic maladies\" was favourable after a few weeks without baths, but three out of seven infants continued to experience troubles associated with sun or water after a 2-7 year follow-up."}
{"answers": "Laparoscopic procedures caused detectable damage to Kupffer and endothelial cells as reflected by elevation of post-operative HA serum levels. The damage to the liver hepatocytes and perisinusoidal cells has no clinical significance and the laparoscopic procedure itself is the probable cause of the Kupffer and endothelial cells damage, while other mechanisms caused damage to the hepatocytes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, laparoscopic cholecystectomy influences peri-sinusoidal cell activity, as evidenced by the significant increase in serum hyaluronic acid (HA) levels in both the study and control groups, and the significant increase in post-operative aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels only in the study group."}
{"answers": "Sleep disorders are common in the general adult population of Japan. Correction for reporting heterogeneity using anchoring vignettes is not a necessary tool for proper management of sleep and energy related problems among Japanese adults. Older age, gender differences in communicating sleep-related problems, the presence of multiple morbidities, and regular exercise should be the focus of policies and clinical practice to improve sleep and energy management in Japan.", "prediction_text": "Yes, adjustment for reporting heterogeneity is necessary in sleep disorders. The study found that without correction for cut-point shifts, age, sex, and the number of comorbidities were significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems. However, after correction, only age, the number of comorbidities, and regular exercise remained significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems. These findings suggest that adjusting for reporting heterogeneity is necessary to accurately estimate the associations between socio-demographic and lifestyle factors and sleep disorders."}
{"answers": "Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is often challenging in men on account of more adhesions and inflammation. This leads to higher conversion rates and more postoperative complications. Optimized planning and a more experienced operating surgeon may help overcome these problems.", "prediction_text": "Yes, sex affects the outcome of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The study found that male patients had a higher conversion rate to open cholecystectomy and longer operating time compared to female patients. Additionally, male patients were more likely to experience bile duct injuries, gallbladder perforation, and gallstone spillage. However, there were no significant differences in mean hospital stay, wound infection, and port-site herniation between male and female patients."}
{"answers": "To uphold the notion for radiation exposure to be as low as reasonably achievable, ureteroscopic stone retrieval can safely be done without the use of fluoroscopy in a significant number of patients.", "prediction_text": "No, fluoroscopy is not essential for the retrieval of lower ureteric stones in all cases. According to the study, complete clearance without the use of fluoroscopy was achieved in 94.2% of patients. Additionally, balloon dilatation and double-J stenting were successfully performed without fluoroscopy in 13 patients."}
{"answers": "Surrogates of injury severity, including days in the ICU and non-ICU hospital LOS>10 days, were associated with the development of HO in our cohort of acetabular fracture patients. Prophylaxis with XRT was significantly protective against the development of HO, and the ability to provide prophylaxis is very likely related to the severity of injury.", "prediction_text": "Yes, surrogates of injury severity significantly influence the occurrence and severity of heterotopic ossification (HO) in fractures of the acetabulum. Specifically, longer lengths of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU, as well as the use of external radiation beam therapy (XRT) for HO prophylaxis, were associated with an increased risk of HO in a multivariate model."}
{"answers": "In this series of 35 patients, the use of epidural analgesia for HIPEC does not seem to be associated with a worse risk of haemodynamic instability, spinal haematoma, meningitis or epidural abscess. HIPEC with platinum salt is not incompatible with the safety of epidural analgesia, with an optimized fluid management peroperatively and the following of perimedullary anesthesia practice guidelines.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found no evidence of a significant risk of spinal haematoma, meningitis, or epidural abscess when using epidural analgesia for surgical treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis with HIPEC."}
{"answers": "The Diabeo system improved glycaemic control in both high and low users who avidly used the IDA function, while the greatest improvement was seen in the low users who had the motivational support of teleconsultations.", "prediction_text": "No, the study suggests that technology alone is not sufficient to improve glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes. While high users of the smartphone-based insulin dose advisor and telemonitoring/teleconsultation function showed a stable level of informed meals and HbA1c levels from baseline to the end of the study, low users showed a significant improvement in HbA1c levels with the addition of teleconsultation support."}
{"answers": "Despite a lower risk of breast cancer, the Sami attended the NBCSP more frequently than the control group. The recall and cancer detection rate was lower among the Sami compared with the non-Sami group.", "prediction_text": "Yes, early outcome measures of mammographic screening are influenced by ethnicity. The study found that the attendance rate in the Norwegian Breast Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP) was higher in the Sami population compared to the non-Sami population (78% vs 75%, p<0.01). Additionally, the recall rates were lower in the Sami population compared to the non-Sami population (2.4% vs 3.3%, p<0.01). However, the rate of invasive screen-detected cancer was not significantly lower in the Sami group (p=0.14). Furthermore, the percentage of all breast cancers detected in"}
{"answers": "GP ablation did not prove to be beneficial for postoperative stable NSR. A complete left atrial lesion set and biatrial ablation are advisable for improving rhythm outcomes. Randomized controlled trials are necessary to confirm our findings.", "prediction_text": "No, ganglionated plexi ablation during the Maze IV procedure does not appear to be beneficial for postoperative long-term stable sinus rhythm. According to the study, there was no significant difference in the percentage of patients in normal sinus rhythm off-antiarrhythmic drugs between the group with and without ganglionated plexi ablation (75.5% vs 67.8%, p = 0.08). Additionally, the absence of ganglionated plexi ablation was not found to be a significant predictor of atrial fibrillation recurrence."}
{"answers": "It is concluded that serum pancreatic lipase is a more accurate biomarker of acute pancreatitis than serum amylase.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, serum pancreatic lipase may improve the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis compared to serum amylase. The study found that the area under the curve (AUC) for serum pancreatic lipase was higher than that for serum amylase in the initial sample of patients received in the Emergency Department (0.948 vs. 0.906, P<0.05). Additionally, a clinically useful cut-off point for serum pancreatic lipase was found to be at the diagnostic threshold of 208 U/L, with a sensitivity of 90.3% and specificity of 9"}
{"answers": "Transgastric endoscopic splenectomy in a porcine model appears technically feasible. Additional long-term survival experiments are planned.", "prediction_text": "Yes, transgastric endoscopic splenectomy is possible. The study demonstrated the technical feasibility of per-oral transgastric splenectomy using a flexible endoscope in a porcine model. The procedure was performed without complications during gastric incision and entrance into the peritoneal cavity, and visualization of the spleen and other intraperitoneal organs was good. The splenic vessels were successfully ligated and the spleen was mobilized using commercially available devices and endoscopic accessories."}
{"answers": "Brachial systolic blood pressure difference is related to the severity of SSS and can be used as a screening tool for SSS. However, it performed better in severe steal than milder steal phenomena.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the blood pressure difference between arms can predict the severity of subclavian steal syndrome (SSS). In this study, patients with complete reversal or alternating flow in the vertebral artery waveform had higher systolic blood pressure differences between arms compared to those with systolic deceleration. This suggests that the degree of blood pressure difference between arms may be a useful predictor of the severity of SSS."}
{"answers": "a-tDCS could be useful in identifying residual connectivity markers in clinically-defined UWS, who may lack of purposeful behavior as a result of a motor-output failure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can be useful in differentiating unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) from minimally conscious state (MCS) patients. The study found that a-tDCS boosted cortical connectivity and excitability in all healthy controls, MCS patients, and even unmasked excitability/connectivity in some UWS patients, indicating that tDCS may be able to differentiate between these two disorders."}
{"answers": "Most people in France are influenced by situational factors when deciding if a physician should breach confidentiality to protect the spouse of a patient infected with STD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that French lay people and health professionals generally find it acceptable to breach confidentiality to protect a patient's wife from a sexually transmitted disease. The study found that lay people and psychologists were more likely to accept breaching confidentiality in this situation than physicians, and that the patient's intentions to protect their wife and inform them of the disease had the greatest impact on acceptability."}
{"answers": "Most students do not encounter all 10 conditions during patient encounters throughout a 4-week EM rotation, although most have exposure to at least eight. Certain conditions are far less likely than others to be encountered, and may need to be taught in a nonclinical setting.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that the majority of medical students (76.9%) saw at least eight of the 10 core emergent conditions identified by the Clerkship Directors in Emergency Medicine (CDEM) National Curriculum Task Force during their 4-week Emergency Medicine (EM) clerkship. Specifically, 15.4% of students saw all 10 conditions, and the average number of conditions seen per student was 8.4 (range of 7.0-8.6)."}
{"answers": "The findings indicate that the clinical significance of symptomatic BDS is similar to that of CBD stones. Bile duct sludge seems to be an early stage of choledocholithiasis.", "prediction_text": "The study found that bile duct sludge (BDS) is less common in patients with recurrent common bile duct (CBD) stones compared to those with no stones on ERCP. The presence of BDS was not associated with an increased risk of CBD stone recurrence, and the other known risk factors for recurrent CBD stones were not statistically different between the two groups. These findings suggest that BDS may have a different clinical significance than CBD stones."}
{"answers": "Routine placement of nasogastric tube in patients operated of LSG seems not useful in reducing leaks' incidence.", "prediction_text": "Yes, nasogastric decompression is useful in preventing staple line leaks after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. The study found that the incidence of staple line leaks was significantly lower in the group that underwent nasogastric decompression during the procedure (0% vs 1.4% in the control group)."}
{"answers": "The results obtained in this study demonstrate that LUS is an accurate and highly sensitive procedure in staging colorectal cancer, providing a useful and reliable diagnostic tool complementary to laparoscopy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, laparoscopic sonography (LUS) is a reliable and sensitive procedure for staging colorectal cancer, particularly for evaluating hepatic metastases. LUS showed a sensitivity of 100% in detecting hepatic metastases compared to preoperative diagnostic means and laparoscopy, and a sensitivity of 94% for nodal metastases compared to preoperative staging. However, the specificity of LUS was low (53%)."}
{"answers": "Most community providers believe IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion; this belief is associated with increased resource use. Experts comply more closely with guidelines to diagnose IBS with minimal testing. This disconnect suggests that better implementation of guidelines is warranted to minimize variation and improve cost-effectiveness of care.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that IBS is not a diagnosis of exclusion. In fact, the experts surveyed were less likely than nonexperts to endorse IBS as a diagnosis of exclusion (8% vs 72%, P<0.0001)."}
{"answers": "Correlation between level of radiographic transition zone on contrast enema and length of aganglionosis remains low. Systematic preoperative biopsy by coelioscopy or ombilical incision is mandatory.", "prediction_text": "No, the radiographic transition zone does not correlate with the level of aganglionosis on the specimen in Hirschsprung's disease. The study found a global agreement of 58.1% and a Kappa coefficient of agreement of 0.39, indicating a poor correlation between the two."}
{"answers": "The presence of a high signal intensity change on T2-weighted MRI and the pyramidal tract sign can be used as prognostic factors for patients with CSA.", "prediction_text": "Yes, signs of spinal cord involvement, such as the presence of T2 high signal intensity areas (T2 HIA) on MRI, are associated with a poorer neurological prognosis in patients with cervical spondylotic amyotrophy (CSA). The study found that the presence of T2 HIA on MRI and conversion to surgery were significantly associated with a poorer recovery of muscle strength at the observational final follow-up, and the presence of the pyramidal tract sign was significantly associated with a poor recovery at the final follow-up after surgery."}
{"answers": "We conclude that not all low-tone sudden deafness (SD) patients suffered from endolymphatic hydrops even if they had vertigo attack at the onset and that electrocochleography (ECochG) was a useful prognostic tool.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that low-tone sudden deafness does not inevitably progress to Meniere's disease. While there was a higher rate of recurrent hearing loss in patients with low-tone SD who experienced vertigo, the study did not find a significant difference in the rate of progression to Meniere's disease between the low-tone and high-tone SD groups. Additionally, the average -SP/AP of patients with a single episode was smaller than that of patients with recurrent episodes and Meniere's disease."}
{"answers": "It is concluded that ACE-DD genotype may be a risk factor for the causation and development of chronic kidney failure among hypertensive patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that ACE-1 gene polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) among hypertensive patients. The DD genotype of the ACE-1 gene was found to be significantly associated with higher levels of blood urea and serum creatinine, and the D allele was associated with an increased risk of CKD among hypertensive patients."}
{"answers": "Older people with a history of amblyopia who develop visual loss in the previously normal eye can experience recovery of visual function in the amblyopic eye over a period of time. This recovery in visual function occurs in the wake of visual loss in the fellow eye and the improvement appears to be sustained.", "prediction_text": "No, the research paper suggests that visual loss due to amblyopia is not permanent. In the study of 12 cases where an improvement in visual acuity was observed in the eye with a history of amblyopia, the mean improvement in distance and near acuity was 3.3 and 1.9 lines logMAR, respectively, indicating that visual loss can be improved with treatment. The improvement occurred between 1 and 12 months from baseline and remained stable over the period of follow-up."}
{"answers": "These results suggest that quantitative real-time PCR assays for BCRABL detection can be comparable between laboratories despite significant differences in methodologies if the same positive control cell line and quality control gene are used. It is imperative that some level of assay standardization be adopted between laboratories, not only for patients who are monitored at different facilities, but also for larger investigative studies in which hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular responses are to be compared.", "prediction_text": "Yes, correlated results are possible from homebrew assays for BCRABL transcript detection by quantitative real-time PCR. The study found a strong correlation (r(s) = 0.9435, p < 0.00001) between the results of 22 paired BCRABL-positive samples analyzed at two different laboratories using different methods, including TaqMan-based assays and different RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, BCR control cell line, and PCR primer and probe sequences."}
{"answers": "Although the exact mechanism of SSDH in this case is unclear, we speculate that this SSDH was a hematoma that migrated from the intracranial subdural space. Low CSF pressure because of continuous drainage and intrathecal thrombolytic therapy may have played an important role in the migration of the hematoma through the spinal canal. It is important to recognize the SSDH as a possible complication of the SAH accompanied with intracranial subdural hematoma.", "prediction_text": "Yes. The study found that spinal subdural hematoma can be a sequela of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm, specifically in cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)."}
{"answers": "LAA occlusion device resulted in a slightly movement in QRS axis, reduced HR and increased the mean-mean QT interval duration. In addition, LA diameter and ARD seemed to be larger after device implantation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, LAA occlusion device alters echocardiography and ECG parameters in patients with atrial fibrillation. The study found a slight and measurable movement of QRS electric axis after LAA occlusion, as well as significant differences in heart rate and mean-mean QT interval between pre- and post-operation. However, there were no significant differences in echocardiographic parameters between before and after device implantation. However, larger LA and ARD dimensions were observed during follow-up visits at 6 and 12 months, respectively."}
{"answers": "The study results suggested that spinal cord untethering may be unnecessary in patients with MM who are undergoing scoliosis corrective surgery and do not present with clinical symptoms of a tethered cord, even though tethering is radiographically demonstrated.", "prediction_text": "No, untethering is not necessary prior to scoliosis correction in patients with myelomeningocele, based on the study's findings. The study found that no patient experienced neurological complications or worsening of neurological function after undergoing scoliosis correction without prior untethering. In fact, the study suggests that untethering may not be necessary in this patient population, as the authors were able to successfully correct the scoliosis without any adverse neurological events."}
{"answers": "Under the conditions of this study, pulpotomy offered a viable alternative to root canal treatment for teeth with vital pulps in the short term. However, there is insufficient clinical evidence to consider this technique for the treatment of every permanent tooth. Nevertheless, it should be considered as a potential alternative approach to be further developed for future applications.", "prediction_text": "No, the study suggests that pulp chamber pulpotomy should not be seen as a permanent treatment. The 2-year survival rate of the treated teeth was 82%, with 2 teeth requiring root canal treatment for pain control and 1 for prosthetic reasons. This indicates that while pulpotomy may be a successful short-term solution, it may not provide a permanent fix for all teeth."}
{"answers": "The site of access in our study does not appear to influence complications specifically neural injury or recurrence rates.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the site of access for endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) in the treatment of small saphenous varicose veins influences early outcomes. The study found that there were no significant differences in the outcomes between the two groups (access gained above mid-calf and below mid-calf) in terms of venous clinical severity scores, Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire scores, patient satisfaction, complications, and recurrence rates up to 1 year after treatment."}
{"answers": "Retinal haemorrhages following a convulsive episode are rare. Such a finding should trigger an extensive search for other reasons, including child abuse.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that it is important to further investigate retinal haemorrhages found after convulsive episodes in young children, as there may be a systemic disorder or child abuse underlying the finding. The study found that one child out of 153 had unilateral retinal haemorrhages after a simple febrile convulsion, and a thorough investigation was unable to identify any other explanation for the finding. Therefore, the study suggests that a thorough evaluation is warranted in children who experience retinal haemorrhages after convulsions to rule out underlying systemic disorders or child abuse."}
{"answers": "Clear and distinct differences between the two studied groups were found indicating the root of this increased confidence may have developed due to exposure to the Pathway program.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the Global Longitudinal Pathway (GLP) medical education curriculum has influenced medical students' skills and attitudes toward culturally diverse populations. A statistically significant difference was found in students' confidence ratings at the end of Years 2, 3, and 4, and qualitative results showed similar findings."}
{"answers": "In normal daily practice, only a small number of clinically important adenomas are missed. The problem of missed adenomas probably is being exaggerated.", "prediction_text": "Yes, according to the study, a small percentage of colorectal cancers (1.3%) may be due to missed adenomas during previous endoscopies."}
{"answers": "Emotional prosody, therefore, seems to be partially processed outside the focus of spatial attention. Whereas at early sensory processing stages spatial attention modulates the degree of emotional voice processing as a function of emotional valence, emotional prosody is processed outside of the focus of spatial attention at later processing stages.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the processing of affective prosody is influenced by spatial attention."}
{"answers": "Pancreas retransplantation is a safe procedure with acceptable graft survival that should be proposed to diabetic patients who have lost their primary graft.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that pancreas retransplantation can be a successful second chance for diabetic patients who have lost their primary graft. The study found that the survival rate of the second pancreas was close to the survival rate of the whole population, and significantly better than the survival rate of the first pancreas. Additionally, the study found that pancreas retransplantation had no impact on kidney graft function and survival. Overall, the study suggests that pancreas retransplantation can be a viable option for diabetic patients who have lost their primary graft."}
{"answers": "Weekend hospitalization leads to delayed provision of intensive procedures and elevated 1-year mortality for elderly AMI patients. The existence of measurable differences in treatments raises questions regarding the efficacy of a single input regulation (e.g., mandated nurse staffing ratios) in enhancing the quality of weekend care. My results suggest that targeted financial incentives might be a more cost-effective policy response than broad regulation aimed at improving quality.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study finds that hospitals provide lower quality care on weekends. Specifically, patients admitted on weekends are less likely to receive immediate intensive cardiac procedures, such as catheterization, angioplasty, and bypass surgery, compared to those admitted on weekdays. This delay in treatment leads to higher rates of adverse health outcomes, including higher mortality and readmission rates for congestive heart failure, in the long term."}
{"answers": "The presence of more than one virus in hospitalized children with ARI is very frequent but it does not seem to have a major clinical impact in terms of severity. However bacterial superinfection increases the severity of the disease course. On the contrary, pneumococcal vaccination plays a protective role.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that the number of detected viruses did not correlate with any markers of severity in children with acute respiratory infections (ARI). However, bacterial superinfection was associated with increased severity, and pneumococcal vaccination was found to be a protective factor in terms of respiratory distress, PICU admission, clinical score, respiratory support requirement, and oxygen necessity."}
{"answers": "In our study, it was observed that although longer ETA was associated with longer hospitalization, ETA was not correlated with postoperative complications. Our results inclined toward the position that appendectomy can be performed as a semielective surgery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that delayed surgery (ETA > 8 hours) was associated with a higher incidence of postoperative complications, including perforation. Specifically, patients who underwent appendectomy more than 8 hours after emergency room registration had a longer hospital stay and a higher complication rate compared to those who underwent surgery within 8 hours."}
{"answers": "Fetal gender does not affect the risk of having an ED visit for asthma during pregnancy, and it is not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes among women who had an asthma-related ED during pregnancy.", "prediction_text": "No, fetal gender is not associated with emergency department visits for asthma during pregnancy, according to the study. The conclusion states that \"fetal gender was not a significant predictor of adverse pregnancy outcomes among women who had an asthma ED visit during pregnancy\" (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85-1.19)."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that working exposure increases the risk or leads to the clinical manifestation of rotator cuff tears. Although a detailed analysis of individual physical exposure is not available yet, the statistical results indicate that rotator cuff tears must be taken into consideration as a result of ergonomic exposure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that rotator cuff tears are more common among males working in certain occupations, particularly those in agriculture and forestry, and the building industry. The study found a significant association between occupation and the development of rotator cuff disease, with a higher incidence of rotator cuff tears among those working in these industries."}
{"answers": "High-quality training, strict compliance with evidence-based guidelines, and thorough documentation is associated with significant reductions in CLABSIs. Mindful organizing may lead to a better understanding of what goes into a unit's ability to handle peak demands and sustain extraordinary performance in the long-term.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the zero central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) rate is sustainable in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of the Floating Hospital for Children at Tufts Medical Center. The study found that the reduction in CLABSI rate was maintained for at least 1 year after the implementation of new practice policies and procedures, and ongoing training, surveillance, and vigilance with catheter insertion and maintenance practices, as well as improved documentation, were identified as key drivers of success."}
{"answers": "Ketamine sedation was successful and well tolerated in all cases. The use of atropine as an adjunct for intramuscular ketamine sedation in children significantly reduces hypersalivation and may lower the incidence of post-procedural vomiting. Atropine is associated with a higher incidence of a transient rash. No serious adverse events were noted.", "prediction_text": "No, atropine is not needed with ketamine sedation based on the study's findings. The study found that atropine significantly reduced hypersalivation compared to placebo, but it did not have a significant effect on other side effects such as vomiting or rash. The trend towards better tolerance was observed in the placebo group. These results suggest that atropine may not be necessary as an adjunct to ketamine sedation in children."}
{"answers": "Findings depict wandering and PNA as overlapping, but nonequivalent phenomena. Evidence supporting construct validity of wandering was more robust than that for PNA. Results have implications for accuracy in scientific and clinical detection and labeling of wandering and agitation.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that wandering and physically nonaggressive agitation (PNA) are not equivalent. While most participants (73.5%) engaged in wandering, all showed PNA behaviors, and factor analyses revealed distinct factors for each construct. Wandering was associated with PNA Factor 1, but not as strongly as PNA Factor 2."}
{"answers": "An advance care planning model is feasible for community palliative care services. Quality audit processes are an essential component of the Model with documentation of advance care planning discussion established as an important outcome measure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the advance care planning model was found to be feasible in community palliative care settings in Victoria, Australia. The study demonstrated that it was possible to embed the model into organizational structures and that advance care planning conversations and family involvement were important outcomes, rather than just completion of advance care planning documents."}
{"answers": "The study allows us to determine that FB can move through the body but not towards the heart. The study also serves as a warning sign: in cases of prolonged histories of FB ingestion, imaging studies are mandatory before endoscopic examination.", "prediction_text": "Yes, foreign bodies (FBs) can migrate through the body towards the heart, as described in the paper. The mechanisms involved in FB migration include the movement of FBs through the mucosa, which can lead to extra-lumen migration. The paper presents four cases of FB migration, including two that migrated from the esophagus to the aorta and neck area, and two that migrated from the pharynx to the prevertebral fascia and submandibular region. The authors discuss the risks posed by FB migration and the methods used to diagnose it, including clinical, radiologic, endoscopic, and ultrasound techniques."}
{"answers": "Although most players in the study believe that rugby headgear may prevent concussion, only a minority reported wearing it. Coaches tended to be less convinced than the players that rugby headgear can prevent concussion.", "prediction_text": "According to the research paper, the conclusion is that the attitudes of players and coaches towards the use of protective headgear for preventing concussion are mixed. While players tend to believe that headgear can prevent concussion, coaches are less convinced. Only a minority of players reported wearing headgear, and few felt that its use should be made mandatory."}
{"answers": "Early oral intake is possible after laparotomy and colorectal resection. Thus, the laparoscopic surgeon's claim of early tolerated oral intake may not be unique to laparoscopy.", "prediction_text": "No, the study suggests that early postoperative oral intake does not have to be limited to laparoscopy. The study found that there was no significant difference in the duration of postoperative ileus or the rate of nasogastric tube reinsertion between patients who received a regular diet after laparotomy with either a colonic or ileal resection in Group 1, and those in Group 2 who were fed in a traditional manner."}
{"answers": "Both medial and lateral PTS were significantly steeper in failures of ACLR than the control group. Medial or lateral PTS \u22655\u00b0 was a new risk factor of ACLR failure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that failures of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) are associated with steep posterior tibial slopes. Specifically, the medial and lateral posterior tibial slopes (PTS) were significantly steeper in the ACLR failure group compared to the control group. The odds ratio of ACLR failure was 6.8 for medial PTS \u2265 5\u00b0 and 10.8 for lateral PTS \u2265 5\u00b0."}
{"answers": "These results suggest the need to provide interventions that are specifically designed to increase awareness of potential stroke signs and symptoms and appropriate subsequent clinical actions.", "prediction_text": "No, only 14% of elderly patients correctly endorsed their intention to call 911 when presented with clinical scenarios suggestive of acute stroke."}
{"answers": "We conclude that routine CXR after bronchoscopy with TBB is necessary only in patients with symptoms suggestive of pneumothorax. In asymptomatic patients, pneumothorax is rare and usually small, so routine CXR is not necessary in this category of patients.", "prediction_text": "No, routine chest radiography after transbronchial biopsy is not necessary, as pneumothorax occurs in only 2.9% of cases and symptoms suggestive of pneumothorax are present in only 7% of cases."}
{"answers": "Early surfactant administration is associated with shorter duration of ventilation but does not appear to be significantly protective against CLD/mortality among premature infants. This may support the growing evidence for consideration of CPAP as an alternative to routine intubation and early surfactant administration. Further investigation from large randomized clinical trials is warranted to confirm these results.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the timing of initial surfactant treatment makes a difference in the rates of chronic lung disease (CLD) or mortality in premature infants. The study found that infants who received early surfactant (within one hour of birth) had lower rates of CLD and mortality compared to those who received late surfactant (after one hour of birth)."}
{"answers": "The study supports the hypothesis that nurses' aides who were exposed to ETS at home during childhood have an increased risk of long-term sickness absence.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that people who were exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) during childhood have an increased risk of long-term work disability, including sick leave exceeding 14 days due to neck pain, high back pain, low back pain, and any illness. The study also found that passive smokers had an increased risk of sick leave exceeding 8 weeks."}
{"answers": "We concluded that depiction of the superior wall of the mandibular canal cannot be improved by changing the thickness of images.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mandibular depiction can be improved by changing the thickness of double-oblique computed tomography images. In this study, the highest value for mandibular depiction was obtained with 0.9 mm-thick images in the alveolar crest and the whole of the mandibular canal. However, there was no significant difference between 0.3 mm and 0.9 mm-thick images, suggesting that thicker images can provide better depiction of the mandible."}
{"answers": "Exclusive CRT approach is not safe to treat patients with low infiltrative rectal carcinoma.", "prediction_text": "No, chemoradiation is not safe for mid and low rectal tumors. The study found that among the 10 patients with complete response (CR) to chemoradiation, 8 experienced local recurrence within 3.7 to 8.8 months. Additionally, 7 patients who underwent radical surgery after chemoradiation experienced local recurrences, resulting in a total of 15 local recurrences among 42 patients (36.6%). These findings suggest that chemoradiation may not be a safe alternative to surgery for mid and low rectal tumors."}
{"answers": "Random survival forests did not yield higher performance compared to Cox proportional hazards. We found improvement in prediction performance when coupling the genetic SNP score with clinical/demographic markers, which warrants further investigation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, multiple SNP testing in BRCA2 and BRCA1 female carriers can improve risk prediction models in conjunction with clinical assessment. The study found that including both a genetic SNP score and clinical/demographic variables in multivariable Cox proportional hazards models or random survival forests improved the predictive ability of risk models for both BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers, with average 1 - c-index values ranging from 0.215 to 0.221."}
{"answers": "Bedtime NPH insulin added to maximal therapy with sulfonylurea and metformin is an effective, simple, well-tolerated approach for patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, continuing oral hypoglycemic agents in addition to starting insulin therapy may be a better option than starting insulin monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes. The study found that the insulin combination group (IC group) had fewer treatment failures (24% vs 2%) and less weight gain compared to the insulin monotherapy group (IM group). Additionally, patients in the IC group reported fewer hypoglycemic events and had equal satisfaction with treatment and general well-being compared to the IM group."}
{"answers": "PET data show that amoxapine's profile is very similar to that of the established atypical antipsychotics. These data, together with amoxapine's in vitro pharmacologic profile, effectiveness in animal models, and efficacy in psychotic depression raise the possibility of amoxapine as an \"atypical\" antipsychotic agent in the treatment of schizophrenia.", "prediction_text": "Yes, amoxapine is an atypical antipsychotic. According to the study, amoxapine has high serotonin (5-HT)2 occupancy, greater 5-HT2 than dopamine (D)2 occupancy, and a higher incidence of extrapyramidal side effects when its D2 occupancy exceeds 80%. These findings are consistent with the definition of an atypical antipsychotic."}
{"answers": "In gravid ewes, intravenous infusion of<or = 1.67 micrograms/min epinephrine altered neither maternal hemodynamics nor uterine blood flow. To the extent that sheep data can be extrapolated to humans, these results suggest that continuous intravenous infusion of epinephrine in local anesthetic solutions is safe if the epidural catheter should enter a blood vessel during the infusion.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that continuous intravenous infusion of low-concentration epinephrine (0.125% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 or 1:400,000 epinephrine) did not impair uterine blood flow in pregnant ewes, but a bolus injection of epinephrine (15 micrograms) did decrease uterine blood flow to 68 +/- 14% of baseline."}
{"answers": "These data indicate that major blunt trauma enhances the migratory capacity of circulating neutrophils. This is manifest within 2 hrs of admission and may be attributable to alteration in interleukin-8 receptor expression, affinity, or downstream signaling. In patients who later develop ARDS, initially elevated circulating neutrophil counts decrease rapidly, over the same time course. Early enhanced neutrophil migratory activity coupled with elevated pulmonary concentrations of interleukin-8 may be central to the establishment of the neutrophil infiltration that is characteristic of ARDS.", "prediction_text": "Yes. The study found that neutrophils isolated from the peripheral blood of patients admitted after major trauma exhibited an enhanced migratory response to high concentrations of interleukin-8 throughout the first 24 hours of admission, compared to normal laboratory volunteers. This suggests that increased neutrophil migratory activity after major trauma may play a role in the etiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)."}
{"answers": "Memory provocation increased the sensitivity of rCBF-SPECT for the detection of AD-related blood flow changes in the brain at the group level. Further studies are needed to evaluate MP-SPECT as a diagnostic tool at the individual level. If a higher sensitivity for AD at the individual level is verified in future studies, a single MP-SPECT study might be sufficient in the clinical setting.", "prediction_text": "The study found that memory-provoked rCBF-SPECT (MP-SPECT) can increase the diagnostic sensitivity of rCBF SPECT in differentiating between Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and normal controls. The study showed a significant reduction in left parietal cortex rCBF in the AD group compared to healthy elderly individuals during memory provocation, but no significant group differences were seen at rest. These findings suggest that MP-SPECT may be a useful diagnostic tool for AD, particularly in differentiating between AD and normal controls."}
{"answers": "1. DBE is a safe and and accurate method to diagnose small bowel disorders; 2. this method permits chromoscopy, biopsies and treatment of the lesions.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study concludes that double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) is an accurate method for diagnosing small-bowel disorders, with a diagnostic yield of 75% and a therapeutic yield of 63.6%. The study found that DBE was able to identify the source of bleeding in 75% of patients with occult or obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, and diagnose other small-bowel disorders such as duodenal adenocarcinoma, jejunal tuberculosis, and lymphomas. The study also found that DBE was a safe procedure, with only minor complications such as sore"}
{"answers": "Reorganization of care to offer a primary angioplasty service was acceptable to patients and their carers. Satisfaction levels were high regardless of the type of care received, with the exception of discharge and aftercare.", "prediction_text": "Yes, primary angioplasty is an acceptable alternative to thrombolysis based on patient and carer satisfaction. The study found that patients who received primary angioplasty had higher satisfaction with the speed of treatment and overall care compared to those who received thrombolysis. While carers rated the convenience of visiting the intervention sites lower, they accepted the added inconvenience in the context of life-saving treatment. However, patient satisfaction with discharge and aftercare was lower in both treatment groups compared to other aspects of care."}
{"answers": "The leukocyte count at presentation can be used as an adjunct in the evaluation of the severity of injury in blunt trauma patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the leukocyte count at presentation correlates with the severity of injury in blunt trauma patients, as shown by a positive correlation with the Injury Severity Score (ISS) and a negative correlation with the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and Revised Trauma Score (RTS)."}
{"answers": "Right ventricular recovery following PVR for chronic significant pulmonary regurgitation after repair of TOF may be compromised in the adult population. In order to maintain adequate RV contractility, pulmonary valve implant in these patients should be considered before RV function deteriorates.", "prediction_text": "No, the study suggests that pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) is not performed too late in adults late after repair of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). The study found that right ventricular volume and function remained unchanged after PVR, with 50% of patients maintaining a right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) of 0.40 or higher after the operation. In contrast, only 13% of patients with pre-operative RVEF <0.40 reached an RVEF of 0.40 or higher postoperatively. These findings suggest that PVR can be safely performed in adults with chron"}
{"answers": "Combined approach tympanoplasty (CAT) allows for successful treatment of cholesteatoma with rates of recurrent and residual disease comparable to open mastoid surgery. Early timing of second-look procedures allows easier removal of any recurrent or residual disease, which reduces the conversion rate to open mastoidectomy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, early second-look tympanoplasty can reduce the rate of conversion to modified radical mastoidectomy. According to the study, the rate of conversion was 3% in cases where second-look surgery was performed within 6 months of primary surgery, compared to 12.5% in cases where second-look surgery was performed after 12 months."}
{"answers": "In 1995, the first year that the MQSA was in effect, there was a significant improvement in the quality of mammography in North Carolina. This improvement probably resulted from facilities' compliance with federal regulations.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the MQSA has significantly improved the quality of mammography in North Carolina, as evidenced by the increase in the percentage of facilities meeting quality standards and the improvement in phantom image evaluation, darkroom fog, and developer temperature passing rates."}
{"answers": "HIE was associated with reduced repeat imaging in EDs. This study is among the first to find empirical support for this anticipated benefit of HIE.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that health information exchange (HIE) reduces redundant imaging in emergency departments (EDs). Specifically, HIE was associated with a reduction in the probability of repeat ED imaging in all three modalities (computed tomography, ultrasound, and chest x-ray) by 44% to 67% relative to the sample means."}
{"answers": "Gestational age misclassification is an unlikely explanation for the reported divergence in average birth-weights for Aborigines and whites. The results might help with the interpretation of other between-population comparisons.", "prediction_text": "No, gestational age misclassification does not explain the difference in birthweights for Australian Aborigines and whites. According to the study, even extreme types of misclassification were required to remove the divergence in median birthweights for the two groups."}
{"answers": "W-d HCCs were clinically demonstrated not to be early cancer, because there was no significant difference in disease free survival between the patients with w-d and l-d HCCs.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study concludes that well-differentiated small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is clinically early cancer. The study found that well-differentiated HCCs had lower incidences of fibrous capsule formation compared to less differentiated HCCs, but there were no significant differences in the incidence of intrahepatic metastasis or portal vein invasion. Additionally, the study found that minute cancerous foci were present in the resected specimens, suggesting that well-differentiated HCCs may be clinically early cancer."}
{"answers": "The incidence of post-tonsillectomy late haemorrhage in our study population was 1.78%. A statistically significant difference was found between night-time and day-time haemorrhages. Even though no significant distribution of haemorrhages per hour was observed, we underline that we recorded 32 (54.2%) events in 2 periods of the day: from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. and from 6 to 9 a.m.", "prediction_text": "Yes, according to the study, post-tonsillectomy late haemorrhage is more likely to occur at night-time (71.2%) than during the day-time (28.8%)."}
{"answers": "Biased estimates of asthma severity may contribute to racially disparate asthma care. Interventions to improve physicians' assessments of asthma severity and patient-physician communication may minimize racial disparities in asthma care.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that physician estimates of asthma severity were less accurate in black than in white patients. Specifically, black patients were more likely to have their asthma severity underestimated by their physicians compared to white patients."}
{"answers": "Many factors contribute to the erroneous reporting of hCG results, including (a) the complexity of hCG molecule and confusion of nomenclature on the various forms of hCG; (b) laboratory personnel's lack of awareness of the distinctions of the forms of hCG and failure to recognize the specificity of assays for their measurement; (c) lack of clarity and uniformity in manufacturers' reagent labeling; and (d) most product inserts' lack of information on the specificity of each method to the various forms of hCG.", "prediction_text": "No, laboratories are not reporting serum quantitative hCG results correctly. The study found errors in the reporting of intact hCG results, with 9.3% of laboratories reporting total beta hCG as intact hCG and 13.1% reporting total beta hCG as intact hCG."}
{"answers": "This study has shown that mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons concerning a certain issue is not sufficient to lead to a change in practice.", "prediction_text": "Yes, familiarization with current evidence can lead to a change in practice. In this study, mailing a one-page summary of recent evidence to surgeons at the Royal Alexandra Hospital resulted in a non-significant decrease in the use of prophylactic nasogastric decompression in elective colonic resections."}
{"answers": "These data suggest that either apoptosis is not involved in cell loss in MTS, or a very slow rate of cell demise may have precluded detecting TUNEL-positive neurons dying through apoptosis. Increased Bax expression and activation of caspases support the latter possibility.", "prediction_text": "No, the cell death in mesial temporal sclerosis is not apoptotic. The study found that there was no evidence for DNA fragmentation by TUNEL staining, and typical apoptotic changes in nuclear morphology were not observed. While Bax expression and activation of caspases were increased, there was no evidence for apoptotic cell death."}
{"answers": "Golytely was more efficacious than MiraLAX in bowel cleansing, and was independently associated with both bowel prep quality (BBPS \u2265 7) and higher adenoma detection. Golytely should be used as first line for bowel prep for colonoscopy. Studies with larger populations are needed to confirm these results.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant difference in the adenoma detection rate between MiraLAX and Golytely. According to the study, the adenoma detection rate was 16.1% in the MiraLAX group and 26.2% in the Golytely group, with a relative risk of 2.28 (95% CI 1.05-4.98, P = 0.04) favoring Golytely."}
{"answers": "Patient's age (>60 y) and large polyp size (>10 mm) were significant predictive factors for neoplastic GB polyps. GB polyps less than 10 mm in diameter do not require surgical intervention simply because they grow.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the growth rate of a gallbladder polyp can predict a neoplastic polyp. According to the study, the growth rate of a polyp was not related to its neoplastic nature, but older age and larger size were significant predictors of neoplastic polyps."}
{"answers": "These data suggest that the R14C KCNQ1 mutation alone is insufficient to cause AF. Rather, we suggest a model in which a \"second hit\", such as an environmental factor like hypertension, which promotes atrial stretch and thereby unmasks an inherited defect in ion channel kinetics (the \"first hit\"), is required for AF to be manifested. Such a model would also account for the age-related increase in AF development.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests a link between genetic and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation. The mutation identified in the KCNQ1 gene, R14C, was found to be associated with atrial fibrillation only in older individuals who had developed atrial dilation and were genotype positive. The mutation resulted in altered channel kinetics and a marked increase in current upon exposure to hypotonic solution, suggesting a stretch-sensitive mechanism for the development of atrial fibrillation. This finding supports the idea that both genetic and environmental factors, such as atrial stretch, play a role in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrill"}
{"answers": "The real-time PCR approach revealed promising results in pollen identification and quantification, even when analyzing pollen mixes. Future perspectives could concern the development of multiplex real-time PCR for the simultaneous detection of different taxa in the same reaction tube and the application of high-throughput molecular methods.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that the real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach offers a new perspective for biomolecular identification of allergenic pollen, providing a rapid, accurate, and automated tool for detection and quantification of airborne allergenic pollen taxa. The study demonstrates the feasibility of developing a PCR-based method for identifying and quantifying specific pollen taxa, which could potentially replace traditional morphologic identification methods. This approach has the potential to enhance aerobiological monitoring and improve the accuracy of pollen count forecasts, which is essential for the management of allergic patients."}
{"answers": "The Ambu SIB was able to accurately deliver targeted pressures across all three models from preterm to infant. The Neopuff infant resuscitator was unable to deliver the targeted pressures in the infant model developing clinically significant levels of inadvertent PEEP which may pose risk during infant resuscitation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the Ambu self-inflating bag (SIB) was found to provide adequate and safe manual inflations for infants up to 10\u2005kg weight in the study. The Neopuff T-piece resuscitator, on the other hand, was unable to reach set peak inflation pressures and exhibited elevated positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) in the infant model, particularly with higher gas inflow rates."}
{"answers": "This longitudinal study found no significant effect of menopausal transition on quality of life among Taiwanese women. The decline in the role limitations due to emotional problems was related to vasomotor symptoms.", "prediction_text": "No, the menopausal transition does not affect the quality of life in middle-aged women, according to the study."}
{"answers": "The incidence of CPM is not increased in IVF/ICSI pregnancies compared with spontaneous conceptions. CPM probably does not account for the adverse perinatal outcomes following IVF/ICSI.", "prediction_text": "No, confined placental mosaicism does not account for adverse perinatal outcomes in IVF pregnancies. According to the study, the incidence of confined placental mosaicism (CPM) was lower in IVF/ICSI pregnancies compared to spontaneous conceptions, and the incidence of fetal chromosomal anomalies was increased in IVF pregnancies, but these differences were not statistically significant."}
{"answers": "For risk stratification in emergency surgical patients, it is essential to measure the APACHE II score before surgical treatment. Longitudinal APACHE II scoring reveals continuous improvement of the score in surviving patients but has no therapeutic relevance in the individual patient.", "prediction_text": "No, the APACHE II score is not a reliable marker of physiological impairment in emergency surgical patients. The study found that the APACHE II score calculated after admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) was significantly higher than the initial score, leading to bias in the comparability of defined groups of patients and the evaluation of treatment policies. Additionally, the predicted mortality rates based on the APACHE II score at admission to the ICU were significantly different from the observed mortality rates, indicating that the score is not a reliable marker of physiological impairment."}
{"answers": "The methodologic weaknesses of the studies do not permit acceptance of increased risk of tubal pregnancy or infertility as a consequence of perforation of the appendix, so a causal relationship cannot be supported by the data currently available. Only a well-designed case-control study with unbiased ascertainment of exposure and adjustment for confounding variables will provide a definitive answer.", "prediction_text": "Yes, perforation of the appendix is a risk factor for both tubal infertility and ectopic pregnancy, with estimates of the risk ranging from 1.6 to 4.8 for these outcomes."}
{"answers": "Cancellous bone plays an important role in primary stability of mini-implants in the presence or absence of cortical bone.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that trabecular bone is related to primary stability of miniscrews. Lower levels of primary stability were observed when the bone mineral density (BMD) of trabecular bone was lower and in the absence of cortical bone. Additionally, there was a correlation between trabecular number, trabecular thickness, BV/TV, trabecular BMD, total BMD, and primary stability measures such as insertion torque (IT), mini-implant mobility (PTV), and pull-out strength (PS)."}
{"answers": "Despite recent efforts, a large proportion of newly confirmed TB patients could not adhere to standard TB treatment, and patients' lost to follow-up was still a serious problem. Poor treatment supervision and heavy financial burden might be the main causes for non-adherence. More needs to be done to enhance treatment supervision policies and financial supports to both health providers and TB patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that 36.0% of TB patients in China were non-adherent to their prescribed treatments, with factors such as lack of direct observation and supervision, as well as financial constraints, contributing to non-adherence."}
{"answers": "While not providing conclusive evidence, this single institution experience suggests that neoadjuvant chemotherapy for Stage IV NPC patients improves both survival and disease control. Recurrence within the irradiated volume was the most prevalent mode of failure and future studies will evaluate regimens to enhance local regional control.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that induction chemotherapy has a role in the management of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The overall actuarial 5-year survival rate for patients who received induction chemotherapy was higher than for those who did not receive it (68% vs. 56%, p = 0.02). Additionally, the 5-year actuarial rates for freedom from relapse and local control were also higher in patients who received induction chemotherapy. However, the study did not find a significant difference in distant failure rates between the two groups."}
{"answers": "There was increased expression of TGF-\u03b21 and VEGF in polyps compared to adjacent normal endometrial tissue. It suggested that these cytokines might play a role in endometrial polyp formation. In addition, there was a significant correlation between steroid receptor expression and VEGF and TGF-\u03b21 expression.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that endometrial polyp formation is associated with increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-\u03b21). Specifically, the expression of VEGF was significantly higher in glandular cells and stromal cells of endometrial polyps compared to adjacent endometrium, while the expression of TGF-\u03b21 was significantly higher in glandular cells and stromal cells of endometrial polyps in the proliferative phase. Additionally, there was a significant correlation between the expression of steroid receptors and VEGF and TGF-\u03b21."}
{"answers": "Primary eosinophilic esophagitis is characterized by fragile esophageal mucosa that readily tears in response to minor trauma during otherwise uneventful diagnostic endoscopy. This \"cr\u00eape-paper\" sign may alert endoscopists to the presence of the disease when other mucosal alterations are lacking. Dilation is effective for patients with symptoms with minimal morbidity, despite development of disquieting lesions in response to the procedure.", "prediction_text": "Yes. The study found that patients with primary eosinophilic esophagitis have extremely fragile, inelastic, and delicate mucosa, which tears easily even with minor trauma, and this pathognomonic sign is termed \"cr\u00eape-paper\" mucosa."}
{"answers": "Preoperative platelet count is a predictive factor for long-term survival in ESCC, especially in nodal-positive patients. We conclude that 205 (\u00d710(9)/L) may be the optimum cutoff point for platelet count in predicting survival in ESCC patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, preoperative platelet count is a prognostic factor in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The study found that patients with a preoperative platelet count \u2264 205 had a significantly better 5-year survival rate than those with a platelet count > 205 (60.7% vs 31.6%, P < 0.001). Additionally, the study showed that the 5-year survival of patients with platelet count \u2264 205 was better than that of patients with a platelet count > 205 when the nodes were involved (32.0% vs 1"}
{"answers": "From this study we conclude that there is no increase in testicular atrophy in patients less than 13 months.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that the age at which orchiopexy is performed affects the survival of the testis. Specifically, testicular atrophy was highest for orchiopexy performed at ages 13-24 months, compared to those less than 13 months and those greater than 24 months. However, after adjusting for location, age was not statistically significant with postsurgical atrophy."}
{"answers": "The results suggest that a longer duration of treatment may prevent return into mental health care in some groups. However, because of the design of the study, no causal inference can be drawn. Further research, preferably in a RCT, is needed to determine whether the trend towards lower intensity treatments is associated with repeated mental health care use.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the duration of psychological treatment for depression is related to the return into treatment. The study found that patients who received shorter durations of treatment (5-250 minutes, 251-500 minutes, and 751-1000 minutes) were slightly more likely to return into treatment compared to those who received longer durations (>1000 minutes)."}
{"answers": "Written information sheets contribute to the process of informed consent. As patients' recall of information is generally poor, the sheets may also be useful medicolegally, as a permanent record of what was discussed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that a written information sheet significantly improves patients' recall of the consent interview for total hip arthroplasty compared to verbal information alone. The patients receiving written information scored higher on a questionnaire completed 18 days later, with 48% correct answers compared to 38% correct answers for the verbal information group."}
{"answers": "Although theoretically plausible, bicompartmental knee arthroplasty was not superior in knee muscle strength and physical performance at 1 year compared with total knee arthroplasty.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that bicompartmental knee arthroplasty is more favourable to knee muscle strength and physical performance compared to total knee arthroplasty. The study found no significant differences in isokinetic knee extensor and flexor strength, hamstring/quadriceps ratio, position sense, and physical performance between the two groups at any time point, including preoperatively, 6 months, and 12 months after surgery. However, the TKA group showed improved stair climbing test performance at 12 months post-surgery."}
{"answers": "These results indicate that T-cell deficiency may affect spatial learning performance following toluene exposure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that T-cell deficiency can affect spatial learning ability following toluene exposure. In particular, nude mice exposed to 90 ppm toluene had a longer escape latency in the acquisition phase compared to wild-type (WT) mice, indicating impaired spatial learning. However, the effect of toluene on spatial learning was not significant in nude mice. These findings suggest that T cells play a role in spatial learning ability following toluene exposure."}
{"answers": "Histology usually demonstrated moderate to severe inflammation when VLEM were present. VLEM may be a highly specific endoscopic feature of esophagitis in children.", "prediction_text": "Yes, VLEM is a true endoscopic manifestation of esophagitis in children. The study found that VLEM were significantly associated with histologic changes in esophageal mucosal biopsies, particularly eosinophilic esophagitis. The specificity and sensitivity of VLEM for detecting eosinophilic esophagitis were 0.85 and 0.5, respectively, indicating a high degree of accuracy. These findings suggest that VLEM can be used as a useful endoscopic marker for identifying esophagitis in children."}
{"answers": "At the gas flows studied, HFNC are not noisier than BCPAP for preterm infants.", "prediction_text": "No, high flow nasal cannulae (HFNC) were not found to be noisier than bubble continuous positive airway pressure (BCPAP) for preterm infants in this study.

However, HFNC was found to be quieter than BCPAP at low frequencies (500 Hz), with a mean difference of 3.0 dBA (95% CI 0"}
{"answers": "Patients with a history of ACD are at an increased risk of having recurrent preterm birth and cervical shortening in a subsequent pregnancy compared with women with prior preterm birth associated PPROM or PTL.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the clinical presentation of a prior preterm birth (SPTB) predicts risk in a subsequent pregnancy. Specifically, women with a history of advanced cervical dilatation (ACD) have a higher risk of recurrent preterm birth (55.2%) compared to those with preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) or preterm labor (PTL) (27.2% and 32.2%, respectively). Additionally, the mean gestational age at delivery was significantly lower for women with a history of ACD compared to those with PPROM or PTL."}
{"answers": "This illustrates that Paget's disease does exist in India and a high index of suspicion is required to clinch the diagnosis.", "prediction_text": "Yes, Paget's disease exists in India. The study found 21 patients with Paget's disease, with a male-to-female ratio of 2.5:1 and a mean age of 49.2 years at presentation. The most commonly involved bones were the skull and spine, followed by the pelvis, femur, tibia, and ulna. The serum alkaline phosphatase level was elevated in all patients at diagnosis and decreased significantly after treatment with bisphosphonates."}
{"answers": "The results of the present study show that idiopathic incidental misty mesentery appearance has a significant prevalence. Also, the high body mass index of these patients and the growing evidence of obesity-induced inflammatory changes in adipose tissue are suggestive of an association between obesity and misty mesentery appearance on CT.", "prediction_text": "The prevalence of incidentally detected idiopathic misty mesentery on multidetector computed tomography (CT) is 7%. Obesity may be a triggering cause of this phenomenon, as 67.5% of the patients were classified as obese."}
{"answers": "Percutaneous ethanol injection without aspiration of ethanol-mixed fluid seems to be the preferable method of treatment of benign cystic thyroid nodules from the perspective of both the physician and the patient.", "prediction_text": "No, aspiration of ethanol-mixed fluid is not advantageous for percutaneous ethanol injection for benign cystic thyroid nodules. The study found no significant difference in the success rates of complete disappearance of the cystic portion of the thyroid nodule between the aspiration and non-aspiration groups. Additionally, there were no significant differences in side effects or complications between the two groups, except for a higher incidence of intracystic hemorrhage in the aspiration group and a longer total procedure time due to the additional procedures required in the aspiration group."}
{"answers": "The present study, which is based on internationally accepted assessment tools for SLE patients, shows a significant relationship between increased disease activity and reduced physical function. This result emphasizes the importance of optimizing treatment aiming at reducing disease activity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found associations between health status, disease activity, and damage in SLE patients. Increased disease activity was significantly correlated with reduced physical function, and greater damage was significantly correlated with reduced role function due to emotional limitations.

{"answers": "Our data suggest that hearing loss caused by GM otic drops may be reduced by the inclusion of BM and benzalkonium chloride. Our finding that BM alone was associated with hearing loss suggests that the benzalkonium chloride may be the protective agent in combination otic drops.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that betamethasone (BM) does not reduce the cochlear toxicity of otic gentamicin (GM) when given together. In fact, the study found that BM actually caused a greater degree of hearing loss in the treated ears compared to the untreated ears."}
{"answers": "A fetal anatomic survey on follow-up sonograms may identify unanticipated fetal anomalies, especially when the indication is for fetal growth.", "prediction_text": "Yes, fetal anatomic assessment on follow-up antepartum sonograms is clinically useful. The study found that compared to follow-up sonography for other reasons, repeated sonography for fetal growth evaluation yielded a higher incidence of unexpected fetal anomalies (12.3% vs 3.5%). Additionally, neonates whose mothers had sonographic examinations for fetal growth had a higher rate of neonatal interventions (40.0% vs 0%). These findings suggest that fetal anatomic assessment on follow-up antepartum sonograms can help identify unanticipated fetal anomalies and potentially prevent or prepare for ne"}
{"answers": "Patients with BRAF-mutant PTC had a significantly longer PFS than BRAF wild-type when treated with TKIs. However, due to the small number of BRAF-mutant patients, further investigations are required, especially to understand the potential positive effect of BRAF mutations in RAIR TC patients while having a negative prognostic impact in RAI-sensitive PTC patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that molecular genotype provides useful information in the management of radioiodine-refractory thyroid cancers. The study found that BRAF mutation status was associated with improved progression-free survival in patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), with BRAF-mutated patients having a median progression-free survival of 34.7 months compared to 11.6 months in non-BRAF-mutated patients. Additionally, the study found that the histological subtype of the cancer, specifically poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC), was an independent prognostic factor for progression"}
{"answers": "The frequency and topographic distribution of LNM are not modified by NACT, and clinical non-responders showed more involved LNs. A systemic and extensive lymphadenectomy should be performed in patients treated with NACT plus surgery regardless of the response to NACT.", "prediction_text": "No, the extent of lymphadenectomy cannot be modified by neoadjuvant chemotherapy in cervical cancer. According to the study, the incidence of lymph node metastasis was significantly decreased in the NACT-responsive group compared to the non-responsive group, but the metastatic rates for every lymph node group also declined in the NACT-responsive group except for the deep inguinal and the para-aortic lymph node groups. This suggests that NACT does not have a modifying effect on the extent of lymphadenectomy in cervical cancer."}
{"answers": "A prior benign prostate biopsy may be independently associated with more favorable surgical and biochemical outcomes after prostatectomy. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings.", "prediction_text": "Yes, prior benign prostate biopsy predicts better outcome for patients treated with radical perineal prostatectomy. The study found that patients who had undergone prior benign prostate biopsy had more favorable pathologic features, including more organ-confined and less margin-positive disease, and lower probability of biochemical failure compared to those without prior biopsy."}
{"answers": "This clinical trial evaluated the possible reduction in intervention-related myocardial damage that was attributable to remote postischemic conditioning.", "prediction_text": "Remote postischemic conditioning did not significantly reduce the maximum increase in troponin levels in the first 24 hours after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with stable angina or non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome, including those with diabetes. Additionally, remote postischemic conditioning did not significantly reduce the risk of heart failure or cardiovascular mortality at 1-year follow-up."}
{"answers": "These results indicate that prophylactic treatment with edaravone prevents I/R-induced ovarian damage during pneumoperitoneum in an experimental rat model.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that edaravone offers protection against ischemia/reperfusion-induced ovarian damage in rats. The results show that administration of different doses of edaravone significantly prevented degenerative changes in the ovary, as evidenced by lower scores for follicular degeneration and edema in the ovarian sections. Additionally, caspase-3 expression was reduced in a dose-dependent manner in the ovarian surface epithelium, indicating that edaravone has a protective effect against oxidative stress-induced damage. Overall, the study suggests that edaravone may be a useful therapeut"}
{"answers": "Sonography has no place in the diagnosis of undescended testis.", "prediction_text": "No, the study suggests that ultrasonography is not accurate in detecting retractile testes and may miss abdominal testes in cases where they are present. Therefore, there is no interest in performing ultrasonography in boys with undescended testis."}
{"answers": "Mammographic density is not associated with an increased need for re-excision or resection of unnecessary margins at initial BCS.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mammographic density has an impact on the margin re-excision rate after breast-conserving surgery. Women with denser breasts (BI-RADS 3 or 4) underwent initial mastectomy more frequently than those with less dense breasts (40.0% vs. 30.5%, respectively). However, the association between breast density and re-excision rates was not seen in the multivariable analysis. Additionally, the rate of unnecessary margins did not differ by breast density."}
{"answers": "Septal suturing after septoplasty offers the following advantages: elimination of discomfort for the patients, minimal complications, the outcome is almost the same as with nasal packing, and finally the hospital stay is less than with nasal packing. Therefore, suturing of the nasal septum after septoplasty should be a preferred alternative to nasal packing.", "prediction_text": "Yes, suturing of the nasal septum after septoplasty is an effective alternative to nasal packing. The study found that suturing the nasal septum resulted in a lower incidence of minor oozing and bleeding compared to nasal packing, and no cases of septal hematoma or perforation were observed in the suturing group. Additionally, the operating time was longer in the nasal packing group. However, both groups had a similar incidence of postoperative adhesions and remnant deviated nasal septum."}
{"answers": "The present study does not support the recommendation of ultrasound as a conclusive diagnostic tool for internal derangements of the temporomandibular joint.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, there is limited sensitivity in detecting internal derangements of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) using ultrasound, particularly when compared to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The study found that articular sounds and physical signs are often insufficient to detect disk displacement, and imaging by static and dynamic high-resolution ultrasound has lower sensitivity than MRI. Therefore, the study suggests that ultrasound may not be a reliable method for detecting internal derangements of the TMJ."}
{"answers": "Our results showed that the serum leptin level has no prognostic indications in advanced lung cancer patients. Leptin is decreased in lung cancer, and there is lack of correlation with tumour\u2011related factors including prognosis. Therefore, leptin is not a useful clinical marker in lung cancer (Tab. 2, Fig. 2, Ref. 22).", "prediction_text": "No, serum leptin levels are not a prognostic factor in advanced lung cancer."}
{"answers": "We found no evidence of serovar specific immunity in our population. It remains possible that populations with a higher prevalence of gonorrhoea and more frequent infections may have a quantitatively greater immune response.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found no evidence of serovar-specific immunity to Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The prevalence of serovars isolated following a repeat infection was not significantly different from those without repeat infections."}
{"answers": "BPPV is associated with positive viral serology, particularly during certain months of the year, mainly in spring and autumn. Viral infection might promote BPPV attacks due to the development of vestibulopathy or induce secondary BPPV via viral infection-related neurolabyrinthitis.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that viral infections play a role in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). The study found that the BPPV group had higher levels of serum viral agents (HSV1, HSV2, Herpes zoster, EBV, CMV, adenovirus, influenza, and parainfluenza virus) compared to the control group, with seasonal variations in the levels of certain viruses."}
{"answers": "We found increased post-ictal serum cytokine levels in patients with several epilepsy syndromes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that cytokines play a role in epilepsy. The levels of several cytokines (TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6) were found to be elevated in the serum of patients with epilepsy compared to healthy controls. Additionally, there were correlations between certain cytokine levels and various clinical parameters, such as male gender, positive family history, and duration of epilepsy. Furthermore, serial analysis during the seizure-free period revealed a decrease in cytokine levels in some patients. These findings suggest that cytokines may play a role in the"}
{"answers": "Neuromedin U reduces insulin and increases somatostatin secretion. Blockade of somatostatin action abolishes the inhibition of insulin secretion by NmU. The results of the study suggest that somatostatin mediates the inhibitory action of NmU on insulin secretion.", "prediction_text": "Yes, somatostatin confers insulinostatic effects of neuromedin U in the rat pancreas. The study found that somatostatin receptors in the pancreas are involved in mediating the effects of neuromedin U on insulin secretion, and that somatostatin antagonist cyclosomatostatin can reverse these effects."}
{"answers": "Patients with fewer or anterior sutures have shorter OR times. However, 30-day readmission, band-related reoperation, and postoperative weight loss were unaffected by number or location of suture. The technical aspects of HHR did not appear to be associated with readmission or reoperation, and therefore a standardized approach may not be necessary.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, the location and number of sutures used for hiatal hernia repair during laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding do matter. The study found that patients who had fewer sutures (1 suture) had shorter operating room time compared to those with more sutures (4+ sutures). Additionally, patients with anterior suture placement had shorter operating room time compared to those with posterior suture placement. However, there was no significant difference in length of stay, 30-day readmission, band-related reoperation, and postoperative BMI/%EWL among the different groups."}
{"answers": "Survivors of lobar ICH with atrial fibrillation should not be offered long-term anticoagulation. Similarly, most patients with deep hemispheric ICH and atrial fibrillation should not receive anticoagulant therapy. However, patients with deep hemispheric ICH at particularly high risk for thromboembolic stroke or low risk of ICH recurrence might benefit from long-term anticoagulation.", "prediction_text": "According to the research paper, patients with a history of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and a clear indication for anticoagulation, such as nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, should not be anticoagulated. The study found that anticoagulation therapy increases the likelihood and mortality of intracerebral hemorrhage, particularly in patients with a history of prior ICH. The decision-analysis model suggested that withholding anticoagulation therapy is the preferred treatment strategy for patients with prior lobar ICH, improving quality-adjusted life expectancy by 1.9 quality-adjusted life years (QAL"}
{"answers": "This study showed that FDG is not a good surrogate tracer for tumor hypoxia under either ambient or hypoxic conditions. Only specific hypoxia tracers should be used to measure tumor hypoxia.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that (18)F-FDG is a surrogate tracer to measure tumor hypoxia. Under normoxic conditions, there was a decreasing similarity between (14)C-EF3 and FDG with higher activity sub-volumes, indicating that FDG uptake is higher in hypoxic regions. Under hypoxic conditions, the similarity between FDG and (14)C-EF3 activity increased, suggesting that FDG is a good surrogate tracer for measuring tumor hypoxia. The DSI values obtained in the study ranged from 0.20 to 0.36, indicating"}

{"answers": "Orthostatic myoclonus is often underdiagnosed and can be considered a possible cause of unsteadiness in subjects with neurodegenerative diseases. Electromyography surface recording is thereby an aid for investigating unsteadiness of unknown origin.", "prediction_text": "Yes. The study found that orthostatic myoclonus (OM) is an underrecognized cause of unsteadiness in neurodegenerative diseases, with a frequency of 17.2% in the study population. The study also found that OM was associated with various neurodegenerative diseases, including multiple system atrophy, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, and normal pressure hydrocephalus. The study suggests that OM should be considered as a potential cause of unsteadiness in patients with neurodegenerative diseases, and further evaluation and treatment may improve symptoms."}
{"answers": "Severely injured patients treated at a level III center had a higher mortality rate than those treated at a level I center. Most problems identified occurred in the emergency department and were related to delays in care provision. This research highlights the importance of efficient prehospital, in-hospital, and regional trauma systems, performance monitoring, peer review, and adherence to protocols and guidelines.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that the level of trauma center providing treatment significantly impacts mortality and hospital length of stay for severely injured adult trauma patients in the Australian health service. Specifically, patients who presented to a level III trauma center had a higher risk of death compared to those who presented to a level I center, after controlling for various factors such as age, sex, Injury Severity Score (ISS), and prehospital time. Additionally, peer review of deaths at the level III center identified problems in care delivery in 15 cases, including technical errors, delay in decision making, and errors of judgment."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that very few genes, which change their expression level during the WOI, show a quantitative homogeneous expression in endometrially-receptive patients. In conclusion, in this study only six genes showed a homogeneous expression, and are probably involved in embryo implantation mechanisms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that only 6 genes (VEGFA, PLA2G2A, ALPL, LIF, NNMT, and STC1) showed a statistically uniform expression among women who subsequently became pregnant during the implantation window."}
{"answers": "While SSA would be the first region to experience the huge benefits of implementing the \"test and treat\" policy of the WHO, the region is not yet prepared to manage the consequential increased burden of ART-related toxic and metabolic complications. Urgent measures should be taken to fill the lacunae if SSA is not to become over-burdened by the consequences of the \"test and treat\" policy.", "prediction_text": "No, sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is unlikely to cope with the increased incidence of antiretroviral therapy (ART) related adverse effects due to the region's weak health systems, lack of resources, and lack of data on ART-related adverse effects. The implementation of the new WHO recommendations is likely to exacerbate the situation, given the high prevalence of cardiovascular disease, lipodystrophy, prediabetes, overt diabetes, insulin resistance, and hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis in the region. Urgent measures are required to address these challenges, including the development"}
{"answers": "In summary we believe sudden onset chest wall rigidity may be a significant and previously unreported factor leading to an increased mortality, from illicit IV fentanyl use. Fentanyl and norfentanyl ratios and concentrations suggest a more rapid onset of death given the finding of fentanyl without norfentanyl in many of the fatalities. Chest wall rigidity may help explain the cause of death in these instances, in contrast to the typical opioid-related overdose deaths. Intravenous heroin users should be educated regarding this potentially fatal complication given the increasingly common substitution and combination with heroin of fentanyl.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that chest wall rigidity could be a factor in rapid death from illicit fentanyl abuse. The lack of any measurable norfentanyl in half of the cases and the strikingly high fentanyl concentrations in some cases suggest that acute chest rigidity may occur rapidly after fentanyl exposure, leading to respiratory arrest and death."}
{"answers": "There appears to be no benefit in metformin co-treatment before and during IVF in women with PCO without any other features of PCOS. Clinical Trials.gov: NCT01046032.", "prediction_text": "No, women with ovaries of polycystic morphology without any other features of PCOS do not benefit from short-term metformin co-treatment during IVF, as the study found no significant improvements in live birth rate, clinical pregnancy rate, or severe OHSS rate between the metformin and placebo groups."}
{"answers": "The study suggests that ventilating an adult patient is possible with a smaller, pediatric-sized BVM. The tidal volumes recorded with the pediatric BVM were more consistent with lung-protective ventilation volumes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that EMS providers can provide appropriate tidal volumes in a simulated adult-sized patient with a pediatric-sized bag-valve-mask (BVM). Only 1.5% of breaths delivered with the pediatric BVM were below the recommended tidal volume, and a greater percentage of breaths were delivered in the recommended range when the pediatric BVM was used. The pediatric BVM provided lower median tidal volumes compared to the adult BVM in all three categories of airway devices."}
{"answers": "Our results suggest that colonoscopy does not affect the management of patients with acute diverticulitis nor alter the outcome. The current practice of a routine colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis, diagnosed by typical clinical symptoms and CT needs to be reevaluated.", "prediction_text": "No, a colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis does not significantly affect its management."}
{"answers": "Pretreatment ECG is of limited value for patients with an unremarkable cardiovascular history and a normal heart rate and blood pressure. Hypotension may occur during treatment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, cardiovascular evaluation is necessary prior to and during beta-blocker therapy for infantile hemangiomas. The study found that while there were no serious cardiovascular complications, 6.5% of patients had ECG abnormalities and 9 patients experienced hypotension that did not require therapy adjustment. Additionally, 81% of parents reported side effects during treatment. Given these findings, it is important to carefully evaluate patients before and during beta-blocker therapy to identify any potential cardiovascular issues and adjust treatment as needed."}
{"answers": "Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is a promising option for lifelong treatment of type 2 diabetes. It has the potential to improve or cure a selected spectrum of type 1 diabetes when performed early in the disease. Further animal model studies or randomized controlled trials are needed to support our conclusion.", "prediction_text": "According to the research paper, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass has shown promise as a potential lifelong solution for diabetes mellitus, particularly for obese patients with type 2 diabetes. The paper highlights that gastric bypass surgery has proven to be highly effective in improving glycemic control and reducing insulin requirements in these patients, with some studies suggesting a potential cure for diabetes in a subset of individuals. However, it is important to note that the long-term durability of the effects and the potential for recurrence of diabetes after surgery are still unknown and require further investigation."}
{"answers": "Collectively, results suggest that behavioral adaptation to ESC is likely in certain drivers; however, its proven effectiveness in reducing the likelihood of being involved in a serious crash probably outweighs any potential increases in unsafe driving. To fully benefit from ESC, vehicle manufacturers are encouraged to market ESC-equipped vehicles in a realistic, safe manner. Driver training and safety organizations are also encouraged to provide balanced educational information about ESC to their members.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that the widespread introduction of ESC into the Canadian vehicle fleet may lead to behavioral adaptation and changes in driving behavior among drivers. While the majority of ESC-equipped drivers were aware of the technology and reported feeling safer and more confident in its ability to work in emergencies, 23% of drivers reported noticing long-lasting changes in their driving behavior since they began driving an ESC-equipped vehicle."}
{"answers": "The results of the study demonstrate that when clinical supervision uses best practice principles, it can provide professional support for allied health workers, even during times of rapid organisational change.", "prediction_text": "Yes, clinical supervision can sustain the allied health workforce in the current healthcare landscape. The study found that longer and more frequent supervision sessions, as well as having more control over the allocation of supervisors and having a clear supervision agreement in place, were significantly associated with higher levels of clinical supervision effectiveness.

{"answers": "Both 'economic/employment' and 'social/welfare' dimensions of social exclusion significantly influence suicide mortality among males. The influence of 'economic/employment' and 'social/welfare' dimensions of social exclusion on female suicide mortality is controversial. Social exclusion might be considered as a risk factor for suicide mortality in Europe.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that both the economic/employment and social/welfare dimensions of social exclusion are significantly associated with suicide mortality among both males and females in Europe. However, the relationship between the economic/employment and social/welfare dimensions and female suicides was not statistically significant, and the relationship between employment rates and the economic/employment dimension was also not significant. Additionally, the study found that GDP had a positive influence on suicide mortality in both male and female models."}
{"answers": "While ultrasound examination is inexpensive and easily done, it is not accurate enough for staging small penile cancers located at the glans penis. However, for larger tumors ultrasound can be a useful addition to physical examination by delineating reliably the anatomic relations of the tumor to structures such as the tunica albuginea, corpus cavernosum, and urethra.", "prediction_text": "Yes, ultrasound examination is a useful addition to clinical staging in squamous cell carcinoma of the penis. The study found that ultrasound can accurately assess the extent of invasion into the corpora and differentiate between invasion of the subepithelial tissue and invasion into the tunica albuginea of the corpus cavernosum. However, the study also noted that ultrasound examination in the region of the glans was not able to differentiate between invasion of the subepithelial tissue and invasion into the corpus spongiosum. Despite this limitation, the study concluded that ultrasound examination can provide valuable information in the clinical staging"}
{"answers": "This study confirms that a large percentage of patients use metered-dose inhalers improperly. It also demonstrates a significant lack of understanding by health care providers of the proper use of metered-dose inhalers. Furthermore, this study supports the use of respiratory care practitioners in the outpatient setting, since they were the most proficient among all the health care providers in the proper use of metered-dose inhalers.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, healthcare providers, including house staff, nurses, and respiratory care practitioners, have limited knowledge in the proper use of metered-dose inhalers. Specifically, house staff and nursing staff were found to be less proficient in using the inhalers correctly, while respiratory care practitioners were the most knowledgeable. Therefore, it can be concluded that healthcare providers may not be adequately equipped to teach patients the proper use of metered-dose inhalers."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrated that the regional or global apex of a given curve is the most rotated level in only a minority of the curves. The most rotated level may be as far as two levels from the global apex and one level from the regional apex.", "prediction_text": "No, the transverse apex does not always coincide with the coronal apex levels (regional or global) in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. According to the study, the regional and global apex levels were at the same level in 54.5% of curves, within half a level in 45.4%, and one level higher in 2% of curves. Additionally, there was a higher variability in the difference between the most rotated levels and the regional and global apex levels, extending up to two levels for the global apex."}
{"answers": "Generalization of the RCT sample was supported, because only 7.8% of Phenomenology subjects did not fit the RCT criteria. Nevertheless, because the RCT subjects were more severely ill, it is unclear if treatment findings from the RCT will be applicable to children with less severe mania.", "prediction_text": "No, the \"Treatment of Early Age Mania (TEAM)\" sample does not generalize to the diagnostic characteristics of child bipolar I disorder. The study found that the TEAM sample had a higher prevalence of mania symptoms, ultradian rapid cycling, psychosis, and suicidality compared to the sample obtained by consecutive new case ascertainment (Phenomenology) study. This suggests that the TEAM sample may be biased towards more severe or atypical presentations of child bipolar I disorder, which may not be representative of the broader population."}
{"answers": "Experts across Europe asserted the right to culturally sensitive health care for all immigrants. There is a broad consensus among experts about the major principles of good practice that need to be implemented across Europe. However, there also is some disagreement both within and between countries on specific issues that require further research and debate.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is still consensus among country experts in Europe on principles of good practice for health care for immigrants, despite discordance within and between countries. The study found 9 themes that emerged as the most important factors for good practice, including easy and equal access to health care, empowerment of migrants, culturally sensitive health care services, quality of care, patient/health care provider communication, respect towards migrants, networking in and outside health services, targeted outreach activities, and availability of data about specificities in migrant health care and prevention. While local political debate, level of immigration, and the nature of local health care systems influenced the selection and rating of"}
{"answers": "Biochemical analysis of injured cervical intervertebral disks reveals the presence of inflammatory markers such as MCP, fragments of structural matrix proteins such as FAC, and a correlation with pH. Further evaluation of the FAC as a potential diagnostic biomarker or therapeutic target is warranted in the cervical spine.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the fibronectin-aggrecan complex (FAC) is present in cervical disk disease. The study found a statistically significant correlation between the FAC and pH levels in the lavage fluid, suggesting that the FAC is present in the cervical disks. Additionally, there was a correlation between the FAC and MCP levels, further supporting the presence of the FAC in cervical disk disease."}
{"answers": "Affect-regulated exercise to feel 'good' can be used in a training programme to regulate exercise intensity. This approach led to a 19% increase in time to reach ventilatory threshold, which is indicative of improved fitness.", "prediction_text": "Yes, training at an intensity that feels \"good\" through affect-regulated exercise improves physical health, as evidenced by a significant increase in time to reach ventilatory threshold in the training group compared to the control group."}
{"answers": "In Southern Italy, hepatitis G virus infection is widespread among patients with chronic hepatitis, independently of parenteral risk factors. Its frequency in subjects with cryptogenic liver disease parallels that observed in hepatitis C virus chronic liver disease, thus ruling out an aetiologic role of hepatitis G virus. TT virus infection is uncommon in patients with cryptogenic or hepatitis C virus-related liver disease who do not have a history of parenteral exposure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that hepatitis G virus and TT virus are involved in cryptogenic chronic liver disease. The study detected hepatitis G virus-RNA in 4 out of 23 patients with cryptogenic chronic hepatitis and 6 out of 40 with hepatitis C virus chronic hepatitis, and at least one marker of hepatitis G virus infection (hepatitis G virus-RNA and/or anti-hepatitis G virus) was present in 6 out of 23 patients with cryptogenic hepatitis and 16 out of 40 with hepatitis C virus liver disease. Additionally, TT"}
{"answers": "Our findings suggest that somatic complaints may represent one, but not necessarily the most important, risk factor for the subsequent development of depressive symptoms in women in nonclinical populations. The results also highlight the importance of including social variables in studies on women's depression as well as conducting additional research to further examine predictors of depressive symptoms in men.", "prediction_text": "Yes, somatic complaints predict subsequent symptoms of depression, specifically in women, based on the prospective data from the RENO Diet-Heart Study."}
{"answers": "Peak inspiratory pressure, PEEP, and ventilation index values could distinguish survivors from nonsurvivors by day 3. This may assist in early application of supportive nonconventional therapies in children with malignancy and ARDS.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that early respiratory predictors of mortality in children with hemato-oncology malignancy who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) include peak inspiratory pressure, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and ventilation index values, which can distinguish outcome by day 3. Additionally, a significant relationship between respiratory data and outcome related to efficiency of oxygenation was present from day 8 after onset of mechanical ventilation, as determined by PaO2/FiO2 and P(A-a)O2."}
{"answers": "In this small study serum inhibin concentrations higher than those found in the early follicular phase one to two weeks after evacuation of a hydatidiform mole seemed to be specific for persistent trophoblastic disease. Further data are needed to confirm these promising results.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that inhibin may be a useful new circulating marker for hydatidiform mole. The study found that the serum concentrations of inhibin in patients with hydatidiform mole were significantly higher than in normal pregnant women, and that these concentrations declined significantly after evacuation of the mole. Importantly, none of the patients whose serum inhibin concentrations were 0.4 U/ml or less after evacuation developed persistent trophoblastic disease. These findings suggest that inhibin may be a useful marker for monitoring the progression of hydatidiform mole and predicting the risk of persistent trophoblastic disease."}
{"answers": "The integration of whole-lesion dynamic data tends to improve specificity. However, no statistical significance backs up this finding.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, the analysis of the whole lesion time curve distribution is not necessary for accurate diagnosis of malignant lesions in MR-mammography (MRM) using CAD. The study found that the most suspect curve, curve-type distribution percentage, and combined dynamic data had similar diagnostic accuracy, with the highest accuracy achieved by combined dynamic data. The differences in diagnostic accuracy between these parameters did not achieve statistical significance. These findings suggest that analyzing only the most suspect curve or the curve-type distribution percentage may be sufficient for accurate diagnosis of malignant lesions in MRM using CAD."}
{"answers": "The seemingly exaggerated traditional fear of anaphylaxis seems to discourage surgeons from more widely adopting minimal access techniques for the treatment of hydatid cyst.", "prediction_text": "Yes, fear of anaphylactic shock is discouraging surgeons from more widely adopting percutaneous and laparoscopic techniques in the treatment of liver hydatid cysts. According to the survey, 78% of surgeons who did not consider minimal-access techniques as their first line of treatment cited fear of anaphylaxis and/or dissemination as the main reason for not using these techniques."}
{"answers": "Grandmultiparous women had increased maternal and neonatal morbidity, and neonatal mortality even after controlling for confounders, suggesting a need for closer observation than regular multiparous patients during labor and delivery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, grandmultiparity is an independent risk factor for adverse perinatal outcomes, including abruptio placentae, preterm delivery, fetal macrosomia, neonatal death, postpartum hemorrhage, and blood transfusion."}
{"answers": "No single data source is likely to provide a complete health profile for an individual. For women with depression in pregnancy and dispensed antidepressants, the hospital admission data do not adequately capture all cases.", "prediction_text": "Yes, women with major depression in pregnancy are identifiable in population health data using data linkage methods. The study found that 16% of pregnant women had depression, with 80% of women dispensed antidepressants not having depression recorded as a comorbidity on their hospital records."}
{"answers": "These data suggest a pattern of diagnostic stability over time for manic and mixed episodes in patients with bipolar disorder. Careful prospective studies of this issue are needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that the manic/mixed episode distinction in patients with bipolar disorder runs true over time. The observed distribution of manic and mixed episodes was significantly more consistent than would be expected by chance, suggesting that patients tend to experience consistent patterns of manic and mixed episodes over an extended period of time."}
{"answers": "The analyses show that structural characteristics of a practice are not associated with uptake of a new IT facility, but that its use may be influenced by post-graduate education in the relevant clinical condition. For this diabetes system at least, practice nurse use was critical in spreading uptake beyond initial GP enthusiasts and for sustained and rising use in subsequent years.", "prediction_text": "Yes, general practice characteristics influence uptake of an IT innovation in primary care. Specifically, the numbers of diabetes-educated staff were associated with increased use of the web-based clinical information system among both nurses and GPs."}
{"answers": "GAPS, a simple clinical score, is a better predictor of admission than triage nurses, unless the nurse is sure about the outcome, in which case their clinical judgement should be respected.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that GAPS significantly outperformed VAS on calibration, discrimination, and accuracy in predicting admission at triage, even when clinical certainty was low. Specifically, GAPS accurately predicted 80.6% of admissions, compared to 79.0% with VAS, and outperformed VAS on all three measures when clinical certainty was low (p < 0.0001)."}
{"answers": "Our data showed no difference in 25(OH) D levels between normal children and those with CD when adjusted for body mass index.", "prediction_text": "No, vitamin D deficiency is not a feature of pediatric celiac disease. According to the study, there was no significant difference in vitamin D levels between children with celiac disease and non-celiac children. However, when the patients were subdivided into obese and non-obese groups, the non-obese CD patients had a significantly higher vitamin D level than the obese normal children."}
{"answers": "Granulomatous myelotoxicity and enteritis developed in a 21 year old female within 3 weeks of initiating sulfasalazine for rheumatoid arthritis. Following a short course of corticosteroids, the patient had resolution of her cholestatic hepatitis, rash, eosinophilia, and gastrointestinal symptoms with no residual manifestations at 7 months follow-up. Although severe reactions to sulfasalazine are rare and unpredictable, practicing physicians should be aware of unusual clinical presentations of toxicity when prescribing sulfasalazine.", "prediction_text": "No, the patient in the paper did not have Crohn's disease. The patient was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and developed a severe systemic reaction to sulfasalazine, which included eosinophilia, granulomatous enteritis, myelotoxicity, cholestatic hepatitis, and seizures."}
{"answers": "Healthy lifestyles lead to an increase in the utilization of preventive health services. However, there is not much significantly reducing the number of outpatient visits in people with health behaviors. Specifically, people with regular exercise habits and who take their blood pressure measurement regularly have an increased number of outpatient visits. It is suggested that more available and accessible health consultation services be provided to inculcate in the general public the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that individuals with healthier lifestyles had lower utilization of healthcare resources, including fewer outpatient visits and health examinations. The study found significant correlations between health behaviors, such as exercise habits, dietary habits, and regular blood pressure measurement, and healthcare utilization. Specifically, individuals who engaged in healthier behaviors had fewer doctor visits and health examinations compared to those who did not. These findings suggest that promoting healthy lifestyles may be an effective strategy for reducing healthcare costs."}
{"answers": "Parental restriction of R-rated movie viewing is associated with both lower adolescent smoking susceptibility and lower smoking rates.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that parental restriction of R-rated movie viewing is associated with lower adolescent smoking susceptibility. The results showed a strong correlation between parental restriction and lower smoking susceptibility, and when controlling for demographic factors and family and friend smoking, respondents with partial or no restriction were more likely to be susceptible to smoking compared to those with full restriction."}
{"answers": "Having a usual physician can be an effective tool in improving access to care for low-income populations, although it is most effective when combined with insurance coverage. However, the effectiveness of managed care in linking more low-income persons to a medical home is uncertain, and may have unintended consequences for uninsured persons.", "prediction_text": "No, managed care does not enable more low-income persons to identify a usual source of care. According to the study, high managed care penetration in the community is associated with a lower likelihood of having a usual source of care for uninsured persons, as well as a lower likelihood of having a usual physician."}
{"answers": "Locally 1.0% ropivacaine administration significantly relieves the pain of pediatric tonsillectomy and, it is a safe and effective method. High concentrations of ropivaciane may produce clinically significant pain relief. It is more effective to reduce of post-operative analgesic requirement after first hour.", "prediction_text": "Yes, topical ropivacaine reduces post-tonsillectomy morbidity in pediatric patients. The study found a statistically significant difference in pain control between the ropivacaine and control groups after the first hour, with the ropivacaine group showing a greater reduction in pain at later time points.

No complications or systemic side effects related to ropivacaine use were observed."}
{"answers": "Minimally invasive mitral valve repair using neochords provided a high rate of repair, reproducible results in a routine cardiac surgery setting and stable repair during follow-up. This has become our preferred technique for mitral valve surgery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, minimally invasive mitral valve repair with artificial chords is reproducible and applicable in routine surgery. The study found that the use of neochords in all patients resulted in a repair rate of 99.8%, with only 3.5% of patients experiencing Grade I regurgitation. The study also showed that patients were fast-tracked and had a low rate of complications, including death within 30 days (1.2%). Additionally, there were no instances of de-insertion or rupture of the neochords, and no patients required reoperation. These findings suggest that minimally invasive mitral valve repair with artificial chords is a safe and"}
{"answers": "Comparisons of absolute EOA values grouped by the manufacturers' valve sizes are misleading because of specific differences in geometric dimensions. The EOA:patient aortic annulus area ratio provides a new hemodynamic index which may facilitate objective comparisons between different valve types.", "prediction_text": "No, the effective orifice area/patient aortic annulus area ratio is not a better way to compare different bioprostheses. According to the study, there was no significant difference in the ratio of effective orifice area to patient aortic annulus area between the Medtronic Mosaic and Edwards Perimount bioprostheses, even after adjusting for variables such as patient anatomy and valve dimensions."}
{"answers": "Women compared to men often delay seeking treatment for an AMI, which further increases their risks. Our findings suggest specific characteristics that can serve as a profile to those African Americans most likely to delay seeking treatment for AMI.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that women were more likely than men to delay seeking medical help for symptoms of acute myocardial infarction due to reasons such as lack of awareness of the severity of their symptoms, lack of perceived urgency, and concerns about seeking help from a healthcare provider."}
{"answers": "A reduced alveolar macrophage phagocytic host response to apoptotic cells or NTHi may contribute to neutrophilic inflammation and NTHi colonization in both PBB and bronchiectasis. Whether this mechanism also contributes to the progression of PBB to bronchiectasis remains unknown.", "prediction_text": "Yes. The study found that children with protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) have lower alveolar macrophage phagocytic capacity compared to control subjects, and this dysfunction persists in children who develop bronchiectasis. The study suggests that impaired alveolar macrophage phagocytosis may be an early marker of bronchiectasis in children."}
{"answers": "Cervical physical therapy can have a positive effect on subjective tinnitus complaints in patients with a combination of tinnitus and neck complaints. Larger studies, using more responsive outcome measures, are however necessary to prove this effect.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that multi-modal cervical physical therapy improves tinnitus in patients with cervicogenic somatic tinnitus (CST). After 6 weeks of treatment, Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) and Neck Bournemouth Questionnaire (NBQ) scores significantly decreased, and the effect was maintained at 6 weeks follow-up. Immediately after treatment, 53% of patients experienced substantial improvement in tinnitus, and 24% maintained this improvement after follow-up."}
{"answers": "Because workers may have an elevated relative aerobic workload for several hours each working day, this relationship may elucidate a mechanism behind the increased risk for cardiovascular disease among workers exposed to high levels of occupational physical activity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found a positive relationship between aerobic workload and ambulatory blood pressure. Specifically, a 1% increase in mean relative aerobic workload was associated with an increase of 0.42 \u00b1 0.05 mmHg in systolic ABP and 0.30 \u00b1 0.04 mmHg in diastolic ABP. These findings suggest that high levels of occupational physical activity may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease by leading to increased blood pressure."}
{"answers": "Our investigation did not undoubtedly prove that significant changes of fetal biometric parameters occurred in the last three decades. It is possible that secular growth acceleration does not exist in prenatal period but also the observed time period could have been short for this phenomenon to manifest.", "prediction_text": "No, secular growth acceleration does not appear during fetal life. According to the study, there were no statistically significant differences in fetal biometric parameters measured by ultrasound between the contemporary fetal population and those from 35 years ago."}
{"answers": "Consistent with prior studies, we found an inverse relationship between obesity and serum prostate specific antigen. However, the magnitude of the difference was small. Thus, adjusting prostate specific antigen for body mass index does not appear warranted.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, there is no significant association between body mass index and prostate specific antigen in men without prostate cancer, even after adjusting for age. Therefore, it is not necessary to adjust prostate specific antigen for body mass index."}
{"answers": "Emergency laparotomy carries a high rate of mortality, especially in those over the age of 70 years, and more needs to be done to improve outcomes, particularly in this group. This could involve increasing acute surgical care manpower, early recognition of patients requiring emergency surgery, development of clear management protocols for such patients or perhaps even considering centralisation of emergency surgical services to specialist centres with multidisciplinary teams involving emergency surgeons and care of the elderly physicians in hospital and related community outreach services for post-discharge care.", "prediction_text": "Yes, 30-day and 1-year mortality in emergency general surgery laparotomies is an area of concern and need for improvement. The study found that the 30-day mortality rate was 12.4% in patients aged <70 years and 22% in those aged >70 years (p < 0.001), and the 1-year mortality rate was 25.15% in patients aged <70 years and 38% in those aged >70 years (p < 0.001). These findings suggest that there is a significant increase in mortality in older patients undergoing emergency"}

{"answers": "The signal intensity on DWI showed no significant difference in the development of vascularization.", "prediction_text": "No, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is not a significant indicator of the development of vascularization in hypovascular hepatocellular lesions (HHLs). According to the study, the 730-day cumulative development of vascularization in hypointense, isointense, and hyperintense lesions was 17%, 30%, and 40%, respectively, but the differences among these developments were not statistically significant."}
{"answers": "General practitioners should consider using patients' first names more often, particularly with younger patients.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, the majority of patients (223) preferred being called by their first names, while 77 disliked it, and only 324 wanted to call their doctors by their first names. Therefore, the conclusion is that patients generally accept being called by their first names by their general practitioners."}
{"answers": "Patients after ART treatment suffer from higher C-section rates during their stage of delivery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that patients who underwent Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) have higher C-section rates compared to spontaneous deliveries. The groups of fresh transferred embryos and slow freezing had higher risks of both elective and emergency C-sections, with odds ratios of 2.0 and 1.4, respectively. Additionally, all groups of ART had an enhanced risk of significant perinatal bleeding."}
{"answers": "Trauma patients have a significant complication rate related to anticoagulation therapy, and predicting which patients will develop a complication remains unclear. Prospective studies are needed to determine which treatment regimen, if any, is appropriate to safely anticoagulate this high risk population.", "prediction_text": "The study found that therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients is associated with a risk of complications, including bleeding and hemorrhage. The incidence of complications was found to be 21% in the study population. The patient factors that were found to be associated with an increased risk of complications were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, use of unfractionated heparin (UH) rather than fractionated heparin (FH), and lower initial platelet count. The study suggests that therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients is not entirely safe and that careful consideration should be given to the potential risks and benefits of anticoag"}
{"answers": "A significant difference in dental health between recruits to each Service does exist and is a likely to be a reflection of the sociodemographic background from which they are drawn.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a differential in the dental health of new recruits to the British Armed Forces. The study found that Army recruits had a significantly higher prevalence of dental decay and greater treatment resource need compared to Royal Navy and Royal Air Force recruits."}
{"answers": "In light of the large sample size and prior pilot testing of presented images, results suggest that episodic migraineurs do not differentially attend to headache-related facial stimuli. Given modest evidence of attentional biases among chronic headache samples, these findings suggest potential differences in attentional processing between chronic and episodic headache subforms.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found no evidence that episodic migraineurs selectively attend to headache-related visual stimuli. The results of the computerized dot probe task showed no within-group differences in reaction time latencies to headache-related compared to happy facial stimuli among both migraineurs and non-migraine controls. Additionally, there were no between-group differences in attentional bias indices for headache or happy facial stimuli, indicating a lack of selective attention to headache-related stimuli among episodic migraineurs."}
{"answers": "Under the conditions of this study, preclerkship (year 2) CPEs strongly predicted medical students at risk for failing a senior CPE. This finding opens the opportunity for remediation of deficits prior to or during clerkships.", "prediction_text": "Yes, students' scores on preclerkship clinical performance examinations can predict that they will fail a senior clinical performance examination. The study found that students who performed poorly on year 2 CPEs had a high risk of failing the senior CPE, with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 77%. Additionally, USMLE Step 1 scores were also found to be predictive, although to a lesser extent."}
{"answers": "Our results suggest that people do not attach a simple fixed premium to \"safety-related\" interventions but that preferences depend more subtly on context. The use of the results of such public preference surveys to directly inform policy would therefore be premature.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that the public values interventions that prevent hospital-acquired infections more highly than interventions related to genetic disorders, and less highly than interventions related to lifestyle and sports injuries."}
{"answers": "Minimising the radiation dose to one of the parotid glands with the help of IMRT in patients with advanced head and neck cancers can prevent xerostomia in most patients and parotid scintigraphy is a useful method of documenting xerostomia.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that dose reduction to one parotid gland does not prevent xerostomia in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancers undergoing intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with or without chemotherapy."}
{"answers": "It is important to continue FA supplementation over the long term in patients on methotrexate and FA in order to prevent them discontinuing treatment because of mouth ulcers or nausea and vomiting. Our data suggest that FA supplementation is also helpful in preventing neutropenia, with very little loss of efficacy of methotrexate.", "prediction_text": "No, the study suggests that patients with rheumatoid arthritis established on methotrexate and folic acid supplements do not need to continue these supplements long term. The study found that stopping folic acid supplementation in patients established on methotrexate resulted in an increased incidence of nausea, but there was no conclusive evidence of a decrease in methotrexate toxicity or efficacy. In fact, the study found that the placebo group had significantly lower disease activity on some variables measured, but these were not of clinical significance. Therefore, the study suggests that the addition of folic acid to methotrexate ther"}
{"answers": "LF and cruroplasty is feasible and has good results in terms of GERD symptoms control and additional weight loss. The high rate of postoperative complications observed in this series remains a matter of concern. A re-sleeve procedure might be considered as an alternative to RYGB/DS conversion restricted to selected patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, laparoscopic fundectomy (LF) is safe and effective as revision surgery for patients who have residual fundus or neofundus after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) for GERD symptoms. The study found that LF resulted in significant improvements in GERD symptoms and weight loss in both groups, with Group B experiencing an additional 53.4% excess weight loss (EWL) at 24 months compared to Group A. While there were some postoperative complications, they were manageable and no mortality or intra-operative complications occurred. The study suggests that LF may be a"}
{"answers": "VAT area measurement at a single level 3 cm above the lower margin of the L3 vertebra is feasible and can reflect changes in VAT volume and body weight. Advances in knowledge: As VAT area at a CT slice 3cm above the lower margin of L3 can best reflect interval changes in VAT volume and body weight, VAT area measurement should be selected at this location.", "prediction_text": "Yes, visceral adipose tissue area measurement at a single level (in this case, 3 cm above the lower margin of L3) can represent visceral adipose tissue volume. The study found the strongest correlations between VAT area and VAT volume, as well as between VAT area and body weight changes, at this specific slice location."}

The incremental cost per quitter at 34-38 weeks pregnant was \u00a31127 ($1716), which is similar to the standard look-up value derived from Stapleton&West's published ICER tables. The life-time model resulted in an incremental cost of \u00a317 and a gain of 0.04 QALYs, giving an ICER of \u00a3482/QALY ($734/QALY). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated uncertainty in the results, particularly regarding relapse after"}
{"answers": "This data demonstrates the robust nature of the short stay ward. At these two very different institutions we have shown improved bed efficient and patient care in a cost-effective way. We have also reported on greater parental satisfaction and early return of the child with their family to the community.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the short stay or 23-hour ward in a general and academic children's hospital is effective. The study found that the short stay ward increased hospital efficiency with an average length of stay of 17.5 hours compared to 20.5 hours in the general ward, and the rate of patient admission to an in-hospital bed was low. Additionally, there were no adverse events reported and parental satisfaction was high. The reallocation of resources to the short stay ward resulted in estimated savings of $1.5 million to $2.3 million to the hospital."}
{"answers": "Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery is a safe method of treatment in patients with Cushing's disease. Operative findings, radiological and histological findings, together with early postoperative serum cortisol and urine free cortisol estimates may identify failures in treatment. Alternative treatment might then be required for these patients. Because of the risk of late relapse, patients require life-long follow-up.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that certain factors can predict the outcome of transsphenoidal pituitary surgery in patients with Cushing's disease. The study found that the presence of a tumor at surgery (52/61 patients) significantly increased the likelihood of achieving remission (38/52 patients). Additionally, when both radiological and histological findings were positive, the likelihood of achieving remission was higher than if both modalities were negative. The study also found that early postoperative serum cortisol levels (2- and 6-week postoperative) and urine free cortisol levels (6-week postoperative) can predict failure"}
{"answers": "Patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms have a great diversity of functional somatic symptoms. They use more somatic and psychotropic drugs than controls in the years before diagnosis. Moreover, they show high rates of referrals and psychiatric morbidity. The diversity of symptoms of patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms supports the concept that symptoms do not cluster in well defined distinct syndromes. Therefore, patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms should preferably not be classified into medical subspecialty syndromes.", "prediction_text": "No, the study suggests that chronic functional somatic symptoms are not a single syndrome, but rather a complex and heterogeneous group of conditions. The study found that patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms had distinctive features in terms of comorbidity, medication use, and healthcare utilization compared to controls, but these features did not fit into a single syndrome."}
{"answers": "The vast majority of MDT decisions are implemented. Management alteration was most often due to patient choice or additional information available after the MDT. A minority of management alterations were 'unjustifiable' and the authors recommend that any patient whose treatment is subsequently changed should have MDT rediscussion prior to treatment.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, 91.5% of multidisciplinary decisions in breast cancer management were concordant, meaning that the patient received the recommended treatment. However, 4.5% of decisions were discordant, with 26 (17.8%) of these considered \"unjustifiable\" as there was no additional information available after the MDT to account for the change in management. The remaining 120 discordant decisions were considered \"justifiable,\" with management altered due to patient choice (n=61), additional information available after MDT (n=54), or MDT error (n=5)."}
{"answers": "We found that 1.6% of S. aureus (all MSSA) from bacteraemic patients were PVL-positive. This low incidence suggests that PVL-positive S. aureus are of no particular significance as causative agents of S. aureus bacteraemia.", "prediction_text": "Yes, Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL) is associated with the pathogenesis of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia in the UK, according to the study. Four out of 244 isolates (1.6%) were found to be PVL-positive, and all four were susceptible to oxacillin. In contrast, 88 out of 244 isolates (36%) were oxacillin-resistant, but none of these were PVL-positive. These findings suggest that PVL may play a role in the pathogenesis of S. aureus bact"}

Ultimately, this study may contribute toward a change for full acceptance of canine-assisted therapy programs within the medical milieu. Additional studies using a similar research protocol on more autistic children will certainly help professionals to work on the most effective methods to individually serve this population through canine-assisted interventions.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that the presence of a certified therapy dog during one-to-one structured activities with a child diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) resulted in more frequent and longer durations of positive behaviors, such as smiling and physical contacting, and less frequent and shorter durations of negative behaviors, such as aggressive manifestations, compared to the control condition without the dog. This suggests that dogs may have the potential to prime autistic children for therapy and improve their behavior during treatment."}
{"answers": "We conclude that increased cardiovascular risk of the DD genotype is not mediated through insulin resistance or abnormalities in fibrinolysis. Conversely, we report an increased sensitivity in NIDDM subjects with the ACE DD genotype.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the insertion allele of the ACE gene (I) is associated with insulin resistance in non-insulin-dependent diabetic (NIDDM) subjects. The study found that NIDDM subjects with the DD genotype had significantly lower levels of specific insulin and increased insulin sensitivity compared to II subjects."}
{"answers": "A history of PIPE may be a risk factor for the development of IPE. Yet, the disappearance of significance on multivariate analysis indicates that it is not an independent predictor.", "prediction_text": "Yes, postictal psychotic episodes (PIPE) are predictive of the development of interictal psychotic episodes (IPE) in adults with a partial seizure disorder. The study found that patients with a history of PIPE, male gender, and bilateral ictal foci were significantly more likely to develop IPE. However, when these variables were entered into a multivariate analysis, only a history of PIPE remained a significant predictor of IPE."}
{"answers": "QTcD is significantly increased in hypertensive patients with LVH compared with those without, being strongly correlated with the indices of LVH. A QTcD cut-off value of 60 ms predicted LVH in hypertensive patients with a high sensitivity and specificity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, corrected QT dispersion (QTcD) can predict left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in hypertensive patients. The study found that hypertensive patients had significantly greater indices of LVH and QTcD compared to controls, and among hypertensive patients, those with LVH had a significantly greater QTcD compared to those without. The optimal cut-off value of QTcD for predicting LVH in hypertensives was found to be 60 ms, with a sensitivity of 92.9% and specificity of 98.2%."}
{"answers": "The shaving of the incision site immediately before spinal surgery may increase the rate of postoperative infection.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that shaving the incision site before spinal surgery increases the postsurgical infection rate compared to not shaving the site. Infection developed in 4 patients in the shaved group and in 1 patient in the unshaved group (P<0.01)."}
{"answers": "The majority of EMS professionals thought that they should participate in disease and injury prevention programs. The respondents were mixed as to whether prevention services should be provided while on emergency calls, but those with experience providing these services were more likely to agree with providing them during emergency calls.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the majority of emergency medical services (EMS) professionals (82.7%) believe that EMS professionals should participate in disease prevention programs."}
{"answers": "Current K/DOQI guidelines are inadequate for correcting VDDI or secondary hyperparathyroidism in CKD patients. Future studies should examine the effects of higher or more frequent dosing of ergocalciferol on these clinical endpoints.", "prediction_text": "No, the current K/DOQI treatment guidelines for vitamin D deficiency in CKD patients may not be adequate. The study found that only 54% of patients achieved a>or = 5 ng/ml increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin D level and only 26% had>or = 30% decrease in iPTH level after treatment with ergocalciferol, suggesting that the recommended doses of ergocalciferol may not be sufficient to correct vitamin D deficiency and hyperparathyroidism in all patients."}
{"answers": "Baseline pain intensity does not predict the outcome after an appropriate opioid titration. It is likely that non-homogeneous pain treatment would have biased the outcome of a previous work.", "prediction_text": "No, pain intensity does not predict a poor opioid response in cancer patients. According to the study, there was no correlation between baseline pain intensity categories and opioid response."}
{"answers": "Maintaining viral load suppression over time in resource-limited-settings is feasible.", "prediction_text": "Yes, it is feasible to maintain HIV viral load suppression over time in resource-limited settings. Of the 619 patients on follow-up, 87.3% had undetectable VL, and only 16.5% experienced virologic failure, with an average of 2.7-fold more virologic failures in patients on third-line ART regimens compared to those on first- or second-line regimens. These findings suggest that TasP strategies can be effective in maintaining VL suppression over time in resource-limited settings, despite the perceived difficulties in achieving and maintaining VL suppression."}
{"answers": "Mucosal redundancy is a constant associated finding in IHPS. Although the origin of the redundancy and a cause-and-effect relationship are difficult to establish, our findings support the hypothesis that hypergastrinemia may be implicated in the pathogenesis of IHPS, and suggest that mucosal thickening could be implicated as one of the initiating factors in its development.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is an etiologic role of pyloric mucosal hypertrophy in the development of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) in infants. The study found that the pyloric mucosa is consistently hypertrophic in infants with IHPS, with a mean mucosal thickness approximating the thickness of the surrounding hypertrophied muscle. The pyloric mucosa also fills and obstructs the pyloric canal, contributing to the development of the stenosis. These findings suggest that pyloric mucosal hypertrophy may play a"}
{"answers": "Given the available screening technologies, discordant TEOAE and AABR may be inevitable for some categories of hearing loss among apparently healthy newborns whose mothers received prenatal care. The potential limitations of perinatal morbidities as basis of targeted screening for such cases therefore merit further consideration.", "prediction_text": "Yes, discordance in TEOAE and AABR outcomes is predictable in newborns. The study found that certain maternal and infant factors, such as mode of delivery and antenatal care attendance, were associated with a higher likelihood of discordant outcomes. Specifically, infants who failed TEOAE but passed AABR (false-positives) were more likely to be admitted into a well-baby nursery, while infants who failed AABR but passed TEOAE (false-negatives) were less likely to have severe hyperbilirubinemia compared to infants with true-negatives. Additionally, the c-statistic for predicting discord"}
{"answers": "GM of CRC and SLM was associated with fewer procedures but did not influence overall survival. SM was associated with a longer delay and increased use of chemotherapy between procedures, suggesting that more rigorous selection of SM patients for surgery may explain the higher disease-free survival after SLM resection.", "prediction_text": "Global management of colorectal cancer with synchronous liver metastases (SLM) at the same centre does not improve outcomes compared to separate management at different centers. The study found that both groups had similar morphologic characteristics and types of resection, and that chemotherapy use before liver surgery was higher in the delayed liver resection group. Additionally, the first step of liver resection was more often performed during colorectal surgery in the global management group, and the mean number of procedures (CRC+SLM) was lower. There were no significant differences in 3-month mortality, overall survival, or disease-free survival between the two groups."}
{"answers": "epiDWI has the potential to differentiate pleomorphic adenoma and myoepithelial adenomas from all other examined entities. Due to an overlap not only within the group of benign and malignant lesions but also between groups, diagnoses should not be addressed on the basis of ADC values solely. Therefore, further studies combining DWI, morphologic criteria, and probably other MR imaging techniques seem warranted.", "prediction_text": "Yes, diffusion-weighted echo-planar MR imaging (epiDWI) can predict different histologic subtypes of primary parotid gland tumors. The study found that pleomorphic adenomas had significantly higher ADC values than other entities, except for myoepithelial adenomas. Warthin tumors had distinct ADC values compared to myoepithelial adenomas, lipomas, and salivary duct carcinomas. Mucoepidermoid carcinomas, acinic cell carcinomas, and basal cell adenocarcinomas could not be differentiated from Warthin tumors."}
{"answers": "The survey shows significant dissatisfaction amongst consultant radiologists with the current service, confirms a low number of paediatric radiologists taking on this work, and suggests the potential to increase numbers of radiology child abuse experts by 27% if given improved training and support. Appropriate service and education strategies should be implemented.", "prediction_text": "No, UK radiologists are not satisfied with the training and support received in suspected child abuse. According to the survey, only 61% of departments had a dedicated paediatric radiologist, and 25% of departments received initial reports on skeletal surveys for physical abuse from non-paediatric radiologists. Additionally, 73% of respondents stated that they would never consider providing expert evidence, even if given adequate radiology and/or legal training."}
{"answers": "The enhancement of serum TNFalpha and IL-6 levels in the patients with ERCP-induced pancreatitis reflects the inflammatory activity. Additionally, these cytokines together with IL-4 can be used in clinical laboratory monitoring of ERCP.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the changes in the serum levels of IL-2, IL-4, TNFalpha, and IL-6 reflect the inflammatory activity in the patients with post-ERCP pancreatitis. According to the study, the levels of IL-4 at 24 hours after ERCP were significantly lower in the patients with post-ERCP pancreatitis than in those without pancreatitis, indicating a decrease in anti-inflammatory cytokine production. Additionally, the levels of TNFalpha at 12 hours after ERCP were higher in the complicated group than those of the uncomplicated group, suggesting an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine production."}
{"answers": "During the 5 years, 24% of Africans with optimal BP developed hypertension. The surge in hypertension in Africa is largely explained by modifiable risk factors. Public health strategies should focus aggressively on lifestyle to prevent a catastrophic burden on the national health system.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that behavioral risk factors, such as smoking and excessive waist circumference, are significant predictors of the conversion from optimal blood pressure to hypertensive status in Black South Africans. The study found that individuals who became hypertensive had higher smoking rates and greater waist circumference at baseline compared to those who remained normotensive. Additionally, baseline \u03b3-glutamyltransferase levels and alcohol intake were also found to predict BP changes and carotid wall area at follow-up. These findings suggest that lifestyle modifications, such as smoking cessation and weight management, may be effective in preventing the conversion from optimal blood pressure"}
{"answers": "Our data have revealed a number of differences. Compared to the clinic sample, the Web-based sample had worse psychological symptom burden, younger average age, higher prevalence of employment, and a lower proportion on ART. For future research, we recommend that Web-based data collection should include the demographic variables that we note differed between samples. In addition, we recognize that each recruitment method may bring inherent sampling bias, with clinic populations differing by geographical location and reflecting those accessing regular medical care, and Web-based sampling recruiting those with greater Internet access and identifying survey materials through specific searches and contact with specific websites.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that Web-based and clinic samples of gay men living with HIV differ on self-reported physical and psychological symptoms. Specifically, the Web-based sample reported higher levels of psychological symptoms compared to the clinic sample, and the clinic sample reported higher levels of physical symptoms compared to the Web-based sample. Additionally, the study found that employment status was associated with both physical and psychological symptoms, with those in employment reporting lower levels of symptoms compared to those not in employment."}
{"answers": "The majority of acetabular components in this cohort were stable despite the small contact surface achieved between the component and pelvic bone. Three of 10 migrated in excess of the limits that predict later loosening in primary THA but it remains to be seen whether these limits apply to this selected group of frail osteoporotic patients. We continue to use this technique routinely to treat patients with the same indications, but since the analysis of these data we have added screw fixation of the acetabular component to the ischial tuberosity and the superior pubic ramus.", "prediction_text": "No, cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups does not provide initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures. According to the study, three of the 10 components had migration above the suggested limits for primary THA at 1 year postoperatively, indicating a lack of initial stability. Additionally, the contact surface achieved between the acetabular component and pelvis ranged from 11 to 17 cm(2), which is below the recommended range of 20-30 cm(2) for primary THA."}
{"answers": "Despite high perioperative mortality, results document a sustainable recovery of the survivors offering the prospect of a highly independent and satisfying life. Therefore, advanced age alone should not be a contraindication for redo cardiac interventions. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2016; 16: 1138-1144.", "prediction_text": "The study found that cardiac reoperations in octogenarians (patients aged 80 years or older) do have benefits in terms of improving functional status and quality of life. Despite a high in-hospital mortality rate of 32.1%, the majority of patients (93%) were able to return home after surgery, and their mean Barthel Index score improved by 17 points. Additionally, their mean New York Heart Association class improved from 2 to 2, indicating improved functional capacity. The study also found that the summary scores of physical and mental health on the short form-12 questionnaire were similar to those of an age- and sex-matched normative population."}
{"answers": "Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (ie, SMI) were more likely than other patients to be admitted to nursing homes with higher deficiency citations for both overall quality and clinical care quality. Further research is necessary to understand the reasons behind the disparity in quality of nursing home care associated with SMI.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patients with serious mental illness (SMI) are more likely to be admitted to nursing homes with more deficiencies in care compared to other patients. The study found that patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder were more likely to enter nursing homes with higher levels of total and healthcare-related deficiencies, after controlling for various factors."}
{"answers": "Patients undergoing open access procedures are less likely to be properly informed about their endoscopic procedure. Our results indicate that with open access endoscopy, a defined mechanism needs to be in place for communication of endoscopic results to the patient.", "prediction_text": "Yes, open access endoscopy may lead to inadequate informed consent and procedure acceptance. The study found that patients in the open access group received less information about the procedure and less explanation of its nature compared to the group referred from a gastrointestinal subspecialty clinic. This suggests that patients in the open access group may not have been adequately informed about the procedure, which could impact their acceptance and understanding of the procedure."}
{"answers": "Contrary to common belief, we found that uterine myomas commonly decrease in volume over the course of pregnancy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, according to the study, uterine myomas tend to enlarge during pregnancy, with a mean increase in volume of 69% in the second trimester and 102% in the last trimester. However, a significant proportion of myomas also decrease in size during pregnancy, with a mean decrease of 35% in the first half of pregnancy and 30% in the second half."}
{"answers": "We found that all of the studied dimensions of restricted fetal growth are independently associated with increased risks of low intellectual performance and that these associations are only partly mediated by socioeconomic or familial factors.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the association between birth characteristics, such as low birth weight for gestational age, and low intellectual performance in early adulthood is not confounded by socioeconomic factors in adolescence or familial effects."}
{"answers": "Although feasible, double reading of barium enemas does not improve sensitivity for detection of polyps and produces a higher false-positive rate.", "prediction_text": "Yes, double reading of barium enemas is necessary. The study found that adding a second reader to the interpretation of barium enemas increased the number of positive results from 249 to 315 (p<0.0001), resulting in potential alteration of clinical treatment in 98 patients (9.9%). The sensitivity of the first and combined readings for detection of all lesions was identical, but specificity decreased from 91.0% to 86.4%. The overall measurement of agreement decreased from 61.8% to 52.9%. These findings suggest that double reading of barium enemas is necessary to improve the accuracy"}
{"answers": "The VMPA can provide direct access and favorable visibility to the TMJ region and yield good esthetic and functional results. The VMPA can be considered the approach of choice for common TMJ surgeries.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the vascular-guided multilayer preauricular approach (VMPA) to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) can improve access and reduce complications compared to traditional TMJ surgery methods. The study found that all patients (606 joints) had successful TMJ surgeries through the VMPA with uneventful recovery and no permanent weakness of the facial nerve or severe complications."}
{"answers": "The metastasis rate of station 9 lymph nodes was significantly lower than other mediastinal stations in lung cancer patients. The metastasis status of station 9 had no significant influence on tumor staging or prognosis. Routine dissection of station 9 lymph nodes may not be necessary, especially in patients with a low T stage, upper or middle lobe tumors, or without intrapulmonary lymph node metastasis.", "prediction_text": "No, routine dissection of station 9 lymph nodes is not necessary for primary lung cancer. According to the study, the metastasis rate of station 9 was significantly lower than other mediastinal stations, and the metastasis rate was significantly correlated with other factors such as pT stage, lobe location, and metastasis status of intrapulmonary lymph nodes. Additionally, the study found that the staging results of most patients would not be impaired if station 9 nodes were not dissected, and the metastasis status of station 9 had no significant influence on survival."}
{"answers": "During the time period considered, the FDA AED-related suicidality warning does not appear to have significantly affected prescription claims of AED medications for the study population.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that there was no significant change in the trend of antiepileptic drug (AED) prescription claims after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) suicidality warning in 2009. Specifically, the study found that the upward trend in AED prescription claims observed before the warning period continued during and after the warning period, with no significant change in trend during the warning period."}
{"answers": "In our population of stroke survivors, self-reports of motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions differed from government records. In future studies, the use of both government and self-reported data would ensure a more accurate picture of driving safety post-stroke.", "prediction_text": "The study found that there is a moderate agreement between Department of Transportation (MTO) records and self-reported data on motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions for stroke survivors. The kappa coefficient for the correlation between MTO records and self-reports was 0.52 for collisions and 0.47 for convictions, indicating a moderate agreement. Additionally, the study found that consulting both sources of data resulted in the identification of up to 56% more accidents and up to 46% more convictions in the study population in the 5 years before study entry compared to when either source was used alone."}
{"answers": "The realized communication skills courses resulted in relevant changes in communication behaviour and self-confidence of participants. Communication with terminally ill patients can be taught.", "prediction_text": "Yes, communication with terminally ill patients can be taught. The study found that a 2-day course model based on the experiences of the first three courses in Rhineland-Palatinate improved participants' communication skills, including their sense of security in different communication settings and their ability to communicate a diagnosis of cancer with good or less good prognosis, recurrence of cancer, or a far progressive cancer disease without curative approach. Participants reported multiple changes indicating increased sensibility and professionalism in their communication behavior 3 months after the course."}
{"answers": "For conditions with a well-developed quality of care evidence base, such as hypertension and diabetes, a single structured implicit review to assess the quality of care over a period of time is moderately reliable. This method could be a reasonable complement or alternative to explicit indicator approaches for assessing and comparing quality of care. Structured implicit review, like explicit quality measures, must be used more cautiously for illnesses for which the evidence base is less well developed, such as COPD and acute, short-course illnesses.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a role for peer review in profiling quality of care, particularly for conditions with a well-established evidence base. The study found that the reliability of implicit review for diabetes and hypertension was significantly higher compared to conditions with a less developed evidence base, such as COPD and a collection of acute conditions. This suggests that peer review can be a useful tool for identifying areas of high-quality care and areas for improvement, particularly for conditions where there is a strong evidence base for best practices."}
{"answers": "The high rate of unsuccessful IUD insertions reported here, particularly for nulliparous women, suggests that the true insertion failure rate of providers who are not employing additional tools for difficult insertions may be much higher than reported in clinical trials. Further investigation is necessary to determine if this is a common problem and, if so, to assess if the use of adjuvant measures will reduce the number of unsuccessful IUD insertions.", "prediction_text": "Yes. According to the study, the rate of unsuccessful copper T380A IUD insertions among women using the IUD for emergency contraception in community family planning clinics in Utah was found to be 19.6% among nulliparous women and 13.6% among parous women. The adjusted odds ratio showed that IUD insertion failure was more likely in nulliparous women compared to parous women, suggesting that failed IUD insertions may be an under-recognized problem in community practice."}
{"answers": "Even in capped health care systems, virtual planning and guided surgery including prebent or milled plates are financially viable.", "prediction_text": "Yes, virtual planning and guided surgery for head and neck reconstruction are economically viable. The study found that the additional cost of virtual planning was reduced by $4,066.50 and $5,867.00 for prebent and milled plates, respectively, due to the time saved during surgery. This suggests that the cost savings from reduced surgery time can offset the additional cost of virtual planning and guided surgery."}
{"answers": "Bipolarity does not independently influence risk of suicidal behavior or alter the influence of well-established suicide risk factors within affective disorders. Suicide risk assessment strategies may continue to appraise these common risk factors without regard to mood polarity.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that risk factors for suicidal behavior do not differ by affective disorder polarity."}
{"answers": "The administration of polyvalent Crotalidae antivenin is safe. Acute hypersensitivity, when it occurs, consists solely in most cases of urticaria. Serious side effects are uncommon.", "prediction_text": "No, the aggressive use of polyvalent antivenin for rattlesnake bites does not result in serious acute side effects, according to the study. The incidence of acute side effects was low, occurring in only 18% of patients, and consisted primarily of urticaria in 98% of cases. No deaths, amputations, or permanent disability occurred in patients receiving antivenin."}
{"answers": "Although endomyocardial fibrosis patients have improved clinical symptoms after surgery, the global left ventricular ejection fraction and regional wall motion in these patients do not change. This finding suggests that other explanations, such as improvements in diastolic function, may be operational.", "prediction_text": "No, quantitative left ventricular regional wall motion does not change after fibrous tissue resection in endomyocardial fibrosis."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrates that laser pretreatment significantly increases absorption of topical lidocaine so that it is detectable in the blood and that manipulating laser settings can affect drug absorption. Future work will look at translating this effect into clinical benefit.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that fractional lasers can enhance transdermal absorption of topical lidocaine in an in vivo animal model. The peak levels of lidocaine were significantly higher at 250 \u00b5m ablative depth, compared to other depths, and the peak levels of its metabolite monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) were significantly higher at the same depth. These results suggest that laser enhances transdermal drug absorption and that this effect can be manipulated by altering laser settings."}
{"answers": "Vaccines were exposed to temperatures that may reduce their potency. Safe storage of vaccines in the clinics cannot be ensured without adhering to the recommended guidelines. Provision of adequate equipment and training for staff in maintaining the \"cold chain\" and the use and care of equipment are important components of a successful immunisation programme.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that there is a weak link in the cold chain for the storage of vaccines in the community. Only 16 of the 40 general practices surveyed were aware of the appropriate storage conditions for vaccines, and only one of the eight practices selected for refrigeration monitoring had a thermometer that was monitored daily. Additionally, six of the eight practices had vaccines exposed to subzero temperatures or temperatures up to 16 degrees C, which is not within the recommended temperature range. These findings suggest that there is a need for improved education and monitoring of vaccine storage in the community to ensure the effectiveness and safety of vaccines."}
{"answers": "p53 alteration detected by IHC or SSCP analysis is not a clinically useful predictor of local response to pre-operative adjuvant therapy in advanced rectal carcinoma.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that p53 alterations cannot be used to predict tumour response to pre-operative chemo-radiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer. The average reduction in tumour size was similar in both groups with and without p53 alterations (53% vs 63%, respectively)."}
{"answers": "The results of this study cast doubt on the suggested advantage of HBO in reducing patient mortality and morbidity when used as adjuvant therapy for NF.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) therapy may be an indication for the treatment of necrotizing fasciitis (NF). The study found that the mortality rate among patients who received HBO as part of their treatment protocol was significantly lower than among those who did not receive HBO (36% vs 25%). Additionally, the HBO group required more surgical d\u00e9bridements per patient, but the average length of hospitalization for survivors was shorter. These findings suggest that HBO may be beneficial in improving patient outcomes for NF."}
{"answers": "High doses of ZNS are effective and safe in pharmacoresistant epileptic patients. Therapeutic drug monitoring of ZNS may be considered at therapeutic failure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that high doses of zonisamide (>500 mg/d) may be effective and well-tolerated in adult patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy. The study found that 55% of patients experienced a 50% or greater reduction in seizures, and 55% of patients are still taking high doses of ZNS after more than a year. While adverse events were observed in 37% of patients, good tolerance to other antiepileptic drugs was observed in 66% of patients. Plasma levels of ZNS were only available in 2 patients, both of which were within the"}
{"answers": "In conclusion, high Ki-67 expression was associated with poor survival in patients with UTUC, as well as a high risk of disease progression, although these findings need to be interpreted with caution. Large-scale, adequately designed, prospective trials are needed to further confirm the value of Ki-67 in prognosis of UTUC patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study concludes that overexpression of Ki-67 is a prognostic biomarker of upper tract urinary carcinoma (UTUC). The study found that patients with high Ki-67 expression had significantly poorer cancer-specific survival (CSS) and disease-free survival (DFS) compared to those with low Ki-67 expression. Additionally, the meta-analysis of the published literature showed that increased Ki-67 levels were associated with poor survival and disease progression, with a pooled HR estimate of 2.081 and 2.791, respectively. The study suggests that Ki-67 overexpression may be a useful pro"}
{"answers": "After comparing MR with arthroscopic findings and reviewing the available literature, we conclude that arthroscopy permits the direct visualization of even fine articular surface changes but does not depict the subchondral bone, the most frequent site of injury detected with MRI. MRI was a very useful tool in the detection and characterization of the different types of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries and showed a statistically significant correlation between site and distribution of bone and cartilage injuries and between internal damage and trauma mechanisms. Therefore, we believe that MRI can help avoid diagnostic arthroscopy in the patients with a history of post-traumatic pain, acute articular blocks and negative radiographic findings.", "prediction_text": "The study concluded that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can substitute for diagnostic arthroscopy in the detection and characterization of occult post-traumatic bone and/or cartilage injuries in the knee. MRI was able to identify three types of occult injuries (bone bruises, subchondral, and osteochondral injuries) with high accuracy, and arthroscopy confirmed the presence of 45 osteochondral and 19 chondral injuries. The study found that MRI was more accurate than arthroscopy in detecting bone bruises and osteochondral injuries, while arth"}
{"answers": "The prevalence of cognitive impairment in MND in this population based study of an unselected cohort was higher than has been previously reported. Language deficits, especially anomia, may be relatively frequent in the MND population. Aphasia in MND may be masked by dysarthria and missed if not specifically examined.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that dementia and aphasia are underrecognized associations in motor neuron disease, with 28% of patients exhibiting major cognitive deficits."}
{"answers": "Postoperative numbness occurs in most patients receiving nasal microfat injections. Partial to complete recovery of nasal tip sensation can be expected to occur over a 3-month period.", "prediction_text": "Yes, sensation returns to the nasal tip after microfat grafting. The study found that the touch threshold value decreased significantly after the injection, but recovered gradually during the follow-up period, with a full recovery by 12 weeks post-injection."}
{"answers": "Conveyance of emotions or movements through music may be decoded differently by persons with different types of communication disorders. Because music is the primary therapeutic tool in music therapy sessions, clinicians should consider these differential abilities when selecting music for clinical interventions focusing on emotions or movement.", "prediction_text": "Yes, communication disorders can extend to musical messages. The study found that children with severe to profound hearing loss (using cochlear implants) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) had lower accuracy in identifying emotions and movements in music compared to children with typical development and normal hearing."}
{"answers": "For some patients, using colour to describe their pain experience may be a useful tool to improve doctor-patient communication.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that patients can use colour to describe osteoarthritis pain. The majority of participants in the study associated high-intensity pain with red, while colours such as purity, calmness, and happiness were used to describe the absence of pain. Participants also identified a range of colours to represent changes in pain intensity, with aching pain associated with grey or black and sharp pain described using a wider selection of colours. While some participants expressed concerns about the interpretability and standardization of colour, the majority believed they could use colour to describe their pain to healthcare professionals."}
{"answers": "It appears safe to administer intensive chemotherapy regimens at standard doses to rural patients without increased morbidity or mortality. Support for general practitioners through phone or videoconferencing may reduce the safety concerns.", "prediction_text": "Yes, intensive chemotherapy is safe for rural cancer patients. The study found no significant differences in the rate of serious adverse events, including febrile neutropenia, diarrhea, and vomiting, between urban and rural patients receiving chemotherapy at the Townsville Cancer Centre. Additionally, there were no toxic deaths in either group. These findings suggest that administering intensive chemotherapy to rural patients at the same doses as urban patients is safe and effective."}
{"answers": "Although outcomes for EPSCC remains poor, both surgery and radiation is shown to significantly improve median, 5- and 10-year survival rates. EPSCC patients who are potential candidates for surgical resection or radiation therapy may benefit from these treatments.", "prediction_text": "Yes, surgery and radiation therapy have a significant impact on survival for patients with extrapulmonary small cell cancers. The study found that patients with EPSCC who underwent surgical extirpation and/or radiation therapy had improved median, 5- and 10-year survival rates compared to those who did not receive these treatments. Specifically, gastrointestinal EPSCC had the highest survival improvement with surgery and/or radiation, while genitourinary EPSCC had the lowest survival improvement. Multivariate analysis revealed that age, gender, stage, radiation, and surgery were independent predictors of survival for all EPSCCs."}
{"answers": "DGE after PPPD seems to be of minor clinical importance following uncomplicated surgery. When taking the results into consideration, it can be said that, despite the lack of a control group, antecolic duodenojejunostomy might be the key to a low incidence of DGE after PPPD. In our experience, DGE is linked to the occurrence of other postoperative complications rather than to pylorus preservation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that delayed gastric emptying (DGE) is related to pylorus preservation after pancreaticoduodenectomy. In the group of patients where postoperative complications other than DGE occurred (n=15), 50% (n=7) exhibited DGE, while in the group where no postoperative complications other than DGE occurred (n=36), only 3% (n=1) exhibited DGE (P=0.002)."}
{"answers": "In women with POP, the symptom of pelvic pain is associated with the presence of defecatory symptoms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, pelvic pain is significantly associated with defecatory symptoms in women with pelvic organ prolapse (POP). The study found that women with pelvic pain are more likely to experience straining with bowel movement, sense of incomplete emptying, pain with bowel movement, and splinting with bowel movement compared to those without pelvic pain. The odds ratios for these associations were 2.4, 4.4, 5.3, and 3.8, respectively."}
{"answers": "The results confirm that c-kit is vastly expressed in uveal melanoma, suggest that the c-kit molecular pathway may be important in uveal melanoma growth, and point to its use as a target for therapy with STI571.", "prediction_text": "Yes, c-Kit-dependent growth of uveal melanoma cells is a potential therapeutic target. The study found that c-Kit is strongly expressed and tyrosine phosphorylated in cultured uveal melanoma cells compared to cutaneous melanoma cells, and that c-Kit maintains a high phosphorylation level in serum-depleted uveal melanoma cells. Treatment of uveal melanoma cell lines with STI571, which blocks c-Kit autophosphorylation, resulted in cell death with an IC(50) of less than 2.5 microM. These findings suggest that target"}
{"answers": "Results suggest that telmisartan may reduce type-I diabetes mellitus-induced hepatic injury by suppressing activated hepatic stellate cells through concomitant TGF-beta1 down-regulation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study concluded that telmisartan prevents hepatic fibrosis in rats with alloxan-induced diabetes. The numerical density of hepatocytes was significantly different between the diabetic control group and the diabetic rats treated with telmisartan, indicating that telmisartan may have protected against hepatic degeneration. Additionally, immunohistochemical staining for TGF-beta in liver sections of the diabetic rats treated with telmisartan showed no immunoreactivity, suggesting that telmisartan may have inhibited the role of TGF-beta in hepatic fibrosis."}
{"answers": "The great majority of U.S. renal transplant centers will not transplant kidneys to HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease, even if their infection is asymptomatic. However, advances in the management of HIV infection and a review of relevant ethical issues suggest that this approach should be reconsidered.", "prediction_text": "No, the survey results suggest that excluding all HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease from transplantation may not be necessary. While the majority of responding centers require HIV testing of prospective kidney recipients and would not transplant an individual who refuses testing, a significant proportion of centers would consider transplanting an asymptomatic HIV-infected patient who is otherwise a good candidate for transplantation. However, it is worth noting that no centers had performed such a transplant in the year prior to the survey, highlighting the need for further research and guidance in this area."}
{"answers": "The overall yield of SL for HCC was 7 %, and the accuracy was 27 %. When accurate imaging methods are available and additional percutaneous liver biopsy is implemented as a standard procedure in the preoperative workup of patients with HCC, the benefit of SL will become even less.", "prediction_text": "Yes, staging laparoscopy (SL) is useful in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The study found that the yield of SL was 7% (95% CI, 3-17%) and the accuracy was 27% (95% CI, 11-52%). Additionally, the biopsy of the contralateral liver was performed for 45 patients who underwent SL, leading to changes in management for 4 patients (17%) with cirrhosis."}
{"answers": "Expert breast pathology assessments continue to be necessary in the management of DCIS.", "prediction_text": "Yes, expert breast pathology assessment is necessary for the management of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The study found that secondary pathology assessments led to a change in the assessment of local recurrence risk in 29% and contributed to a change in treatment recommendation in 43% of cases, highlighting the importance of expert breast pathology assessment in accurately evaluating the risk of recurrence and guiding treatment decisions."}
{"answers": "Vaginal pH should be measured by bringing the pH strip in direct contact with fresh vaginal fluid without first adding saline.", "prediction_text": "No, the study concludes that vaginal pH cannot be accurately measured from wet mount microscopy slides due to systematic increases in pH caused by the addition of saline, leading to false positive readings."}
{"answers": "This study presents a different clinical picture of oral mucoceles/ranulas, as observed in HIV-positive patients. Additionally, it suggests a possible clinical link between the two pathologies. The authors strongly support the suggestion that oral mucocele/ranula is an HIV-related salivary gland disease.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that oral mucocele/ranula is another human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related salivary gland disease. The study found that 72% of the patients with oral mucocele/ranula were HIV positive, and 92.1% of those with plunging ranulas were HIV positive, compared to only two patients in the HIV-negative group. These findings strongly suggest that HIV infection increases the risk of developing both simple and plunging ranulas."}
{"answers": "There are no data to support the widespread practice of using central venous pressure to guide fluid therapy. This approach to fluid resuscitation should be abandoned.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the central venous pressure (CVP) predicts fluid responsiveness in adult patients, with a summary area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.56 (95% CI, 0.54-0.58). This result was consistent across different locations (ICU and operating room) and patient populations. The correlation coefficient between the baseline CVP and change in stroke volume index/cardiac index was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.1-0.25), with higher coefficients found in ICU patients (0.28, 95% CI, 0.16-0.40) compared to operating"}
{"answers": "Increased D-dimer levels should not be considered as a diagnostic parameter in diagnosis of acute appendicitis.", "prediction_text": "No, D-dimer cannot become a new diagnostic parameter for acute appendicitis based on the study's findings. The study found no statistically significant difference in D-dimer levels between histopathologic study groups, and the ratio of cases with a number of leukocytes below the upper limit was also not significantly different between groups. These findings suggest that D-dimer levels are not a reliable diagnostic marker for acute appendicitis."}
{"answers": "Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that mitochondria play a role in remodeling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death (PCD). The study showed that mitochondrial dynamics, including distribution, motility, and membrane potential, change during PCD in lace plant leaves. The study also found that the formation of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) plays a role in PCD, and that inhibition of PTP formation using cyclosporine A (CsA) can reduce the number of perforations in lace plant leaves. These findings suggest that mitochondria play a key role in the remodeling of lace plant leaves during PCD"}
{"answers": "Our study emphasised the discomfort of transurethral urinary catheters, especially in male patients, and the high incidence of urinary tract infections in both sexes. Consideration should be given to the utilisation of alternative methods of bladder drainage, such as suprapubic catheterisation, which can be performed with ease during laparotomy.", "prediction_text": "No, transurethral catheterisation is not the ideal method of bladder drainage based on the study's findings. The study found that male patients were more dissatisfied with the procedure and experienced more pain during catheter insertion and removal, and a higher incidence of urinary tract infections compared to female patients. These findings suggest that transurethral catheterisation may not be the most comfortable or effective method of bladder drainage for all patients."}
{"answers": "Based on this pilot data, MASCC score appears promising in determining suitability for outpatient management of NF in gynecologic oncology patients. Prospective study is ongoing to confirm safety and determine impact on cost.", "prediction_text": "Yes, risk stratification is useful for inpatient versus outpatient management of neutropenic fever in gynecologic oncology patients. The study found that high-risk patients were more likely to experience severe complications, ICU admission, overall mortality, and death due to neutropenic fever compared to low-risk patients. The MASCC risk index score had a positive predictive value of 50% and negative predictive value of 90%. The median MASCC score for patients who experienced a severe complication or death was lower than for those who did not (17 vs. 22). These findings suggest that risk stratification can help identify"}
{"answers": "Halofantrine has mild to moderate pathological effects on cochlea histology, and can be considered an ototoxic drug.", "prediction_text": "Yes, halofantrine is ototoxic. The study found that the drug caused loss and distortion of inner hair cells, inner phalangeal cells, and spiral ganglia cells in guinea pigs."}
{"answers": "Proportionally fewer elderly patients with OPSCC are being treated than younger individuals. These patients can have significant benefits from aggressive treatments despite their older age as shown by our survival analysis. We recommend the use of objective measures to assess patient fitness to reduce the potential for undertreatment in the elderly population.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that elderly patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) are undertreated, particularly those aged 55-74 years. The analysis showed that the number of patients who did not receive treatment (surgery, radiation, or combined therapy) increased with age, with a significant increase in the number of patients aged 55-74 who did not receive treatment. Additionally, the study found that patients aged 65-74 and 75-84 had substantial benefits in disease-specific survival (DSS) with surgery, radiation, or combined therapy compared to younger age groups. However, the study did"}
{"answers": "Minimal access surgery for the repair of esophageal atresia or congenital diaphragmatic hernia is not associated with less cumulative opioid doses.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that minimal access surgery in newborns does not result in significantly less postoperative pain compared to conventional surgery. The study found no significant differences in cumulative opioid doses at 12, 24, 48 hours, and 7 days postoperatively between the minimal access surgery group and the control group for both esophageal atresia (EA) and congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH)."}

{"answers": "European individuals with type 1 diabetes consume a high atherogenic diet as few patients met recommendations for dietary fibre and saturated fat. This study showed minor changes in dietary nutrients and energy intakes over a period of 7 years. Nutrition education needs particular focus on strategies to increase dietary fibre and reduce saturated fat to exploit their potential benefit.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that European individuals with type 1 diabetes do not consume a high atherogenic diet. In fact, there were minor changes in nutrient intakes over time, with some reductions in saturated fat and cholesterol intakes, and small increases in carbohydrate and fibre intakes. While there were some deviations from European nutritional recommendations, particularly for fibre and saturated fat, the overall dietary pattern was not considered atherogenic."}
{"answers": "The gaps in patella eversion demonstrated smaller gaps both in knee extension and flexion position compared to the gaps of patella reduction position. The amount of decreased gaps was more definite in knee flexion position. Therefore, the intraoperative patellar positioning has influence on the measurement of the joint gap. Keeping the patella in reduced position is important during gap balancing.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patella position significantly influences ligament balancing in total knee arthroplasty. The study found that the gaps in patella eversion were smaller in both knee extension and flexion positions compared to the gaps in patella reduction position. The difference in gaps was more pronounced in knee flexion position. Additionally, there was significant variability in knee flexion position, with 24% of knees in patella subluxation and 66% of knees in patella eversion demonstrating either increased or decreased gaps in this position compared to the gaps in patella reduction position. These findings suggest that patella position can have a significant"}
{"answers": "We have thus provided compelling evidence that there is a mossy fiber GABAergic signal. The physiologic role of this mossy fiber GABAergic signal is uncertain, but may be of developmental importance. Other evidence suggests that this GABAergic signal is transiently upregulated after seizures. This could have an inhibitory or disinhibitory effect, and further work is needed to elucidate its actual role.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mossy fibers release GABA. The study found that mossy fiber terminals show intense immunoreactivity for GABA and GAD67, and electrical stimulation of mossy fibers elicits monosynaptic GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic signals in CA3 pyramidal neurons."}
{"answers": "Men and women in this community sample reported similar patterns of depressive symptoms. No evidence that the presentation of depressive symptoms differs by gender was found.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that there were no significant gender differences in the self-report of depression symptoms after adjusting for covariates such as age, ethnicity, education, marital status, and employment."}
{"answers": "Time to primary treatment after a diagnosis of breast cancer had no impact on overall survival. Further studies on care before diagnosis are important in drawing up meaningful quality indicators.", "prediction_text": "No, delays in time to primary treatment after a diagnosis of breast cancer do not impact survival, according to the study."}
{"answers": "Our findings reveal a significant decrease in ADMA levels of ex-ELBW subjects compared to C, underlining a probable correlation with preterm birth and low birth weight. Taken together, these results may underlie the onset of early circulatory dysfunction predictive of increased cardiovascular risk.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that ADMA levels in young adults born preterm were significantly lower than in healthy adults born at term, and were inversely correlated with gestational age and birth weight. These findings suggest that ADMA levels in young adults born preterm may predict early endothelial dysfunction."}
{"answers": "ECL assays improved the ability to predict time to diabetes in these autoantibody-positive relatives at risk for developing diabetes. These findings might be helpful in the design and eligibility criteria for prevention trials in the future.", "prediction_text": "Yes, electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assays improve prediction of time to type 1 diabetes in autoantibody-positive TrialNet subjects. The study found that subjects who were ECL positive had a significantly higher risk of progression to diabetes within 6 years compared to ECL-negative subjects (58% vs 5%, P<0.0001). Additionally, the inclusion of ECL positivity in a multivariate model improved the prediction of time to diabetes, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.83 (P<0.0001)."}
{"answers": "These findings indicate that a relationship between multiple sclerosis and streptococcal infections may exist, but to acquire a better understanding of the role of group A streptococci in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, more studies with animal models are necessary.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant relationship between streptococcal infection and multiple sclerosis. The study found that patients with relapsing-remitting MS had higher levels of antideoxyribonuclease B (ADNase B) compared to healthy blood donors, indicating a possible association between streptococcal infection and the development of MS."}
{"answers": "Aplastic anemia is associated with a variety of autoimmune syndromes. The sequence of events in our patient suggests that the hepatic failure, AFOP, and the VSAA may all have been part of an autoimmune syndrome. AFOP could be the result of immune dysregulation in this pediatric case with favorable outcome after immunosuppressive therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP) may be an expression of immune dysregulation, as the patient in the study developed VSAA (very severe aplastic anemia) following a fulminant hepatic failure of unknown origin. The presence of AFOP in the lung biopsy and the negative infectious workup support this conclusion. The use of immunosuppressive therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the treatment of VSAA also suggests that the immune system may be playing a role in the development of AFOP."}
{"answers": "Rescue AC may apply to only 18% of cases, and we identified subsets of more likely candidates.", "prediction_text": "The study found that only 17.9% of women remained pregnant for more than a week after receiving antenatal corticosteroids, and only 124 women (17.9%) delivered at or after 34 weeks' gestation. The study suggests that there may be limited opportunity for rescue corticosteroid administration to prolong pregnancy after the initial dose."}
{"answers": "The results show that fatigue in patients with pSS and sSS is not due to the coexistence of FM in most cases. A lower incidence in the United Kingdom of FM in patients with pSS was found than has been previously reported.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant link between primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (pSS) and fibromyalgia (FM). The study found that 68% of patients with pSS reported experiencing fatigue, which is significantly higher than the prevalence in the lupus group (50%). Additionally, none of the patients with SLE/sSS had FM, while 12% of patients with pSS had FM. These findings suggest a strong association between pSS and FM."}
{"answers": "UDR provides an objective measurement of VUR and appears as a predictive tool of success after endoscopic injection.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that distal ureteral diameter (UD) is a significant predictor of reflux resolution after endoscopic injection in children with primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). The study found that a larger distal UD was associated with a lower likelihood of reflux resolution, while a smaller UD was associated with a higher likelihood of reflux resolution. Specifically, the study found that for every 1-mm increase in UD, the likelihood of reflux resolution decreased by 37.8%."}
{"answers": ": Data from both association and expression studies suggested that variants at HINT1 may be associated with schizophrenia and the associations may be sex-specific. However, the markers showing associations were in high LD to the SPEC2/PDZ-GEF2/ACSL6 locus reported previously in the same samples. This made it difficult to separate the association signals amongst these genes. Other independent studies may be necessary to distinguish these candidate genes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1) gene is a candidate for schizophrenia. The study found nominally significant differences in allele frequencies in several SNPs around the HINT1 gene region in both the Irish study of high density schizophrenia families (ISHDSF) and the Irish case control study of schizophrenia (ICCSS), suggesting a potential role of HINT1 in the etiology of schizophrenia. Additionally, the study found significant interactions amongst sex, diagnosis, and rs3864283 genotypes in expression studies, further supporting the candidate status of HINT1 for"}
{"answers": "Out of the four sacral sparing criteria, the acute phase anal sensory score measurements do not contribute significantly to the prognosis of independent ambulation. The combination of the acute phase voluntary anal contraction and the S4-5 LT and PP scores, predicts significantly better chronic phase-independent ambulation outcomes than the currently used distinction between complete and incomplete SCI.", "prediction_text": "No, the determination between complete and incomplete traumatic spinal cord injury is not clinically relevant for predicting independent ambulation at 1 year post-injury."}
{"answers": "These findings suggest that schizophrenia is associated with progressive structural brain abnormalities, affecting both gray and white matter. We found no evidence to suggest progressive medial temporal lobe involvement but did find evidence that this may be partly explained by heterogeneity between studies in patient age and illness duration. The causes and clinical correlates of these progressive brain changes should now be the focus of investigation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that there are progressive brain changes in schizophrenia over time. Subjects with schizophrenia showed significantly greater decreases in whole brain volume, gray matter volume, and white matter volume, as well as larger increases in lateral ventricular volume, compared to healthy control subjects. The differences between patients and control subjects in annualized percentage volume change were observed in multiple brain regions, including the frontal, parietal, and temporal white matter, and the bilateral lateral ventricles. These findings suggest that brain changes in schizophrenia are progressive over time."}
{"answers": "The elevated risk of death after CABG surgery known previously to be associated with CDM seems also to be shared by a group of similar size that includes patients with IFG and undiagnosed DM.", "prediction_text": "Yes, even impaired fasting blood glucose levels preoperatively are associated with increased mortality after CABG surgery. The study found that patients with impaired fasting blood glucose (IFG) had a higher risk of 30-day and 1-year mortality compared to those with normal fasting blood glucose levels. The relative risks of mortality were 1.7 and 2.9 for IFG, and 2.8 and 1.9 for suspected diabetes mellitus (SDM) compared to patients with normal fasting blood glucose levels."}
{"answers": "This is the first known report of concurrent plasma and ISF concentrations of a meropenem antibiotic during CVVHDF. We observed that the ISF concentrations of meropenem were significantly lower than the plasma concentrations, although the present dose was appropriate for infections caused by intermediately susceptible pathogens (MIC\u22644 mg/L).", "prediction_text": "Yes, interstitial fluid (ISF) concentrations of meropenem in critically ill patients receiving continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) are equivalent to plasma concentrations. According to the study, the comparative median (IQR) ISF and plasma peak concentrations were 13.6 (12.0-16.8) and 40.7 (36.6-45.6) mg/L, respectively, and the trough concentrations were 2.6 (2.4-3.4) and 4.9 (3.5-5.0) mg/L, respectively"}
{"answers": "Despite advances in early diagnosis and surgical technique, 5-year survival of stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma remains low as compared to survival of other solid organ neoplasm. Tumour size<or=3cm, adenocarcinoma histologic type and negative bronchial resection margins were associated with a more favourable outcome in our patient population. More effective multimodality treatments are needed to increase survival rates.", "prediction_text": "Based on the study's conclusion, Stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma is not necessarily an early stage. The study found that significant prognostic factors for overall 5-year survival included histology (adenocarcinoma vs squamous cell carcinoma), tumour size (<3cm vs >3cm), and the presence of a negative resection margin. These findings suggest that even in patients with Stage I disease, the cancer can be more aggressive and have a poorer prognosis than expected."}
{"answers": "There is a knowledge deficit regarding the SU treatment goal among gout patients receiving ULT, despite generally high levels of other gout-specific knowledge. SU goal information may be an important and underutilized concept among providers treating gout patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that only 14% of gout patients knew their target serum urate (SU) goal, despite the central role of achieving and maintaining the SU goal with urate-lowering therapy (ULT). The study also found that having a rheumatologist as the initial prescriber and knowing the other 5 gout-specific knowledge questions were associated with greater odds of knowing the SU goal."}
{"answers": "Despite government assistance, low-income individuals use vision care services less often than wealthy individuals.", "prediction_text": "Yes, government assistance improves utilization of eye care services by low-income individuals. The study found that among middle-aged whites who self-reported not having glaucoma, cataracts, diabetes, or vision problems not corrected by lenses, utilization of eye care providers was significantly higher among those with financial difficulty compared to those without (28.1% vs 41.9%, p<0.05). The prevalence ratio adjusted for age, sex, and education was 0.68 (95% CI 0.57-0.80), indicating that government assistance was associated with a 32% reduction in the likelihood"}
{"answers": "Premature births from rural mothers have a higher risk of stillbirth and mortality in neonatal intensive care than urban infants.", "prediction_text": "Yes, rural residence is associated with poorer neonatal outcomes in premature birth. Compared to urban infants, rural infants have a higher mortality rate (adjusted odds ratio 1.26, 95% confidence interval 1.07-1.48, p=0.005) and a higher stillbirth rate (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.09-1.32, p<0.001) in the state of New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory."}
{"answers": "Altered ET-1 levels may be involved in the pathogenesis of rebound hypertension and hypotension during HD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that there is a role for endothelin-1 (ET-1) in the hemodynamic changes during hemodialysis. The study found that the levels of ET-1 were significantly higher in dialysis patients compared to healthy controls, and that the post-dialysis ET-1 levels were not changed significantly in patients with stable intradialytic hemodynamics (group I) but decreased in patients with dialysis-induced hypotension (group II) and increased in patients with rebound hypertension (group III) compared to predialysis values. These findings suggest that ET-1 may play a role in the pathogenesis"}
{"answers": "While FS was commonly used in patients undergoing thyroidectomy at our institution, in no patient over the last decade did FS correctly alter the intraoperative management. Given the time required to perform FS and the cost associated with it, we believe that routine FS should not be performed in these patients.", "prediction_text": "No, the frozen section did not alter the surgical management of multinodular thyroid disease in the study population."}
{"answers": "Elderly patients have informational and relational needs similar to those of younger patients. In fact, most of the whole sample flagged up the need for higher levels of satisfaction especially concerning a better dialogue with health staff, along with a new factor: the need to talk to people with the same illness.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that elderly cancer patients have different care needs compared to younger patients. Specifically, the older group expressed more frequent requests for financial-insurance information, the need to talk to people with the same illness, and the need for a better dialogue with clinicians. However, few significant differences were found between the two age subgroups in terms of other care needs, such as the need for intimacy and support."}
{"answers": "According to the results of our study and the data from the international literature, the entity globulomaxillary cyst is no longer justified.", "prediction_text": "No, globulomaxillary cysts do not exist as a distinct entity. The study found that the cystic lesions previously classified as globulomaxillary cysts actually belong to other entities, including lateral periodontal cysts, radicular cysts, keratocystic odontogenic tumors, adenomatoid odontogenic tumors, periapical granulomas, residual cysts, and undefined jaw cysts."}
{"answers": "Although components of the CSM (cognitive and emotional representations, coping strategies) were associated with fears of recurrence, optimism was found to be the strongest predictor of fear, independent of anxiety and level of fear reported prior to treatment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, according to the study, fears of recurrence in head and neck cancer survivors can be predicted by pre-treatment fears and optimism."}
{"answers": "Older adults enrolled in PICT with more symptoms may sacrifice QOL for experimental treatment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, symptoms matter when considering patients for phase I clinical trials. Older adults with advanced cancer who experience more than three symptoms have a higher likelihood of admissions, complications, and greater decline in functional status compared to those with fewer symptoms."}
{"answers": "Effective CPAP treatment in IPF patients with OSA results in a significant improvement in daily living activities based on the FOSQ, namely an OSA-specific follow-up instrument. Improvement was also noted in other questionnaires assessing quality of life, though not to a statistically significant degree, probably because of the multifactorial influences of IPF on physical and mental health. The probability of poor CPAP compliance was high and could only be eliminated with intense follow-up by the CPAP clinic staff.", "prediction_text": "Yes, CPAP therapy offers a better quality of life and sleep in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and obstructive sleep apnea. The study found a statistically significant improvement in the Functional Outcomes in Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ) scores at 1, 3, and 6 months after CPAP initiation. Although the improvement was not statistically significant in other sleep and quality of life parameters, a trend towards improvement was observed in these measures as well. Additionally, the study identified two patients who had difficulty complying with CPAP and stopped using it, but heated humidification was added to improve nocturnal cough, which may help improve adher"}
{"answers": "Income support policy may be a significant new lever for improving population health, especially that of lower-income persons. Even though the findings are robust, further analyses are needed to confirm their reliability. Future research should examine a variety of different income support policies, as well as whether a broader range of social and economic policies affect health.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program reduces disability in the elderly. The study found that higher benefits are linked to lower disability rates, with an increase of $100 per month in the maximum SSI benefit causing a 0.46 percentage point decrease in the rate of mobility limitations among all single elderly individuals. The findings were robust to sensitivity analyses, including those limited to subgroups most and least likely to receive SSI, varying the disability measure, and excluding certain subgroups."}
{"answers": "None of the clinical identifiers for early-stage adhesive capsulitis previously proposed by expert consensus have been validated in this study. Clinicians should be aware that commonly used clinical identifiers may not be applicable to this stage.", "prediction_text": "The study found that among the 8 clinical identifiers proposed for early-stage primary/idiopathic adhesive capsulitis, only pain at the end of range of all measured active movements was associated with a positive anesthetic response (PAR)."}
{"answers": "Despite current recommendations, cough and cold medicines are still used in children younger than 6 years of age. A significant portion of caregivers report that they are still unaware of public warnings, potential side effects, and interactions with other medications.", "prediction_text": "Yes, concerns about the use of cold preparations in young children still exist, as 72% of caregivers incorrectly dosed the medication they desired to give during the study."}
{"answers": "Vitamin C reduces the prevalence of complex regional pain syndrome after wrist fractures. A daily dose of 500 mg for fifty days is recommended.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that vitamin C can prevent complex regional pain syndrome in patients with wrist fractures. The prevalence of complex regional pain syndrome was significantly lower in the vitamin C group compared to the placebo group, with a relative risk of 0.41, 0.17, and 0.17 for the 200, 500, and 1500 mg doses, respectively. Early cast-related complaints also predicted the development of complex regional pain syndrome."}
{"answers": "The tendency to clear one's plate when eating is associated with increased body weight and may constitute a risk factor for weight gain.", "prediction_text": "Yes, plate clearing is a risk factor for obesity. The study found that individuals who tend to clear their plates when eating have a higher BMI compared to those who do not. The association remained significant after accounting for other demographic and behavioral predictors of BMI."}
{"answers": "ACS is common in patients with SCD who present with fever and was grossly underestimated by evaluating physicians. History and physical examination appear to be of little value in defining which febrile patients require CXR. In view of the mortality and morbidity associated with ACS, empiric CXR should be considered when evaluating a febrile patient with SCD.", "prediction_text": "The study found that clinician assessment for acute chest syndrome (ACS) in febrile patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) is not accurate enough, with a sensitivity of only 39%. The study showed that only 61% of ACS cases were not clinically suspected by the evaluating physician before obtaining chest radiography (CXR), highlighting the limitations of clinical assessment in detecting ACS."}
{"answers": "We conclude that the quality of rectal cancer excision, as defined by mesorectal grades, achieved by supervised colorectal trainees is comparable with that achieved by consultants.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no significant difference in the quality of total mesorectal excision (TME) surgery between supervised colorectal trainees and consultants, as measured by mesorectal grades."}
{"answers": "Dutch primary schools could play a more important role in fostering healthy eating habits among children. The school food policy could be improved by clearly formulating food rules, simplifying supervision of the food rules, and defining how to enforce the food rules. In addition, the school food policy will only influence children's dietary behaviour if both the school and the parents support the policy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is room for improvement in the school food policy at Dutch primary schools. While most principals reported having a written food policy, the rules were not clearly defined, and teachers and principals believed that parents were primarily responsible for encouraging healthy eating habits among children. Parents generally appreciated the policy, but there was variation in their opinions on the enforcement of the policy."}
{"answers": "Speed discrimination, per se, is not impaired in schizophrenia patients. The observed abnormality appears to be a consequence of impairment in generating or integrating the feedback information from eye movements. This study introduces a novel approach to motion perception studies and highlights the importance of concurrently measuring eye movements to understand interactions between these two systems; the results argue for a conceptual revision regarding motion perception abnormality in schizophrenia.", "prediction_text": "No, the study suggests that motion perception deficit in schizophrenia is not a direct consequence of eye-tracking abnormality. The results of the experiment showed that eye-tracking performance was not significantly different between schizophrenia patients and control subjects at 150 msec, but patients had higher thresholds at 300 msec. Additionally, the frequency of eye tracking during speed discrimination was significantly correlated with speed discrimination in control subjects but not in patients, suggesting that eye-tracking initiation may benefit control subjects but not patients. These findings suggest that other factors may contribute to motion perception deficit in schizophrenia beyond eye"}
{"answers": "(1) There is little overlap between regions of CFAEs during AF and regions of SRF measured in the time domain or the frequency domain, (2) the majority of SRF appears to occur in regions with wave-front collision, (3) the distribution of SRF is similar in patients with AF and normal controls, suggesting that this may not have an important role in AF maintenance and may not be a suitable ablation target.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no significant relationship between complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAEs) recorded during atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm fractionation (SRF)."}
{"answers": "Continence function remained undisturbed after anastomotic leakage due to rectal resection", "prediction_text": "Yes, anastomotic leakage after rectal resection for cancer does affect functional outcome, as there was no significant difference in continence score between patients with and without leakage."}
{"answers": "No evidence was found for OPLL to have any effect on the initial neurologic status or recovery in motor function after traumatic cervical cord injury, suggesting that the neurologic outcome is not significantly dependent on canal space.", "prediction_text": "No, ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) does not significantly affect the neurological outcome after traumatic cervical spinal cord injury, according to the study.

{"answers": "The study data suggests a possible correlation between cervical discopathy and cervical MS plaque.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant relation between cervical cord plaques and discopathy in patients with multiple sclerosis. According to the study, 69.1% of patients with both cervical discopathy and cervical cord plaques had the plaques at the same site as the discopathy. This finding suggests that there may be a correlation between the location of the cervical discopathy and the location of the cervical cord plaques in MS patients."}
{"answers": "Higher MCVs and AST/ALT ratios in ASH reflect the severity of underlying liver disease and do not differentiate NASH from ASH. Instead, these biomarkers might prove useful in guiding selection of patients for liver biopsy and in targeting therapy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, routine laboratory markers are useful for differentiating nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) from alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH). The study found that high-grade fibrosis and an AST/ALT ratio >1 were more common in ASH, while the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) was elevated in ASH patients and normal in NASH patients. Multivariate analysis identified the MCV, AST/ALT ratio, and sex as relevant predictors of ASH, and the AST/ALT ratio and age as independent predictors of high-grade fibrosis. These findings suggest that routine laboratory markers can be useful in"}
{"answers": "We found no evidence that IBR compromised the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy, although there was a significant incidence of implant infection.", "prediction_text": "No, immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) does not compromise the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy. According to the study, there was no significant difference in the median time to chemotherapy between the IBR and mastectomy alone groups. Additionally, the overall complication rates were comparable between the two groups, with slightly higher rates of return to surgery in the IBR group and more seromas in the mastectomy group. These findings suggest that IBR does not have a significant impact on the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy."}

{"answers": "The homogeneity we found in the deprivation-mortality relationship across the regions of Scotland and the absence of a contextualized effect of region highlights the importance of taking a broader strategic policy that can combat the toxic impacts of socio-economic deprivation on health. Focusing on a few specific places (e.g. 15% of the poorest areas) to concentrate resources might be a good start but the impact of socio-economic deprivation on mortality is not restricted to a few places. A comprehensive strategy that can be sustained over time might be needed to interrupt the linkages between poverty and mortality.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study finds that context matters for the relationship between deprivation and all-cause mortality. The research shows that there are spatial hotspots of high mortality rates and deprivation in the West of Scotland, and coldspots of low mortality rates and deprivation in the rest of the country. The study rejects the hypothesis of spatial heterogeneity in the relationship between socio-economic deprivation and mortality, indicating that the relationship between the two variables is consistent across different regions."}
{"answers": "This study adds to the growing body of literature documenting the importance of the individual therapist as an important factor in the change process.", "prediction_text": "The study found that approximately 12% of the variability in the PTSD Checklist (PCL) scores at the end of treatment was due to differences between therapists. The trainer identified several characteristics and actions of effective therapists, including effectively addressing patient avoidance, using flexible interpersonal style, and developing a strong therapeutic alliance. These findings suggest that there is some degree of uniformity in the implementation of evidence-based treatments (EBTs) in practice, as effective therapists were able to produce similar outcomes despite differences in their individual styles and approaches. However, further research is needed to determine the extent to which these findings can be generalized to other"}
{"answers": "New depression diagnosis and antidepressant use was shown to be less likely in areas of higher own-ethnic density for some, but not all, ethnic groups.", "prediction_text": "Yes, depression diagnosis and antidepressant prescribing vary by location. The study found that black and minority ethnic groups are up to four times less likely to be newly diagnosed with depression or prescribed antidepressants compared to white British patients. However, the results also showed an inverse relationship between neighbourhood ethnic density and new depression diagnosis for some groups, with a reduced odds of depression for Pakistani, Indian, African, and Bangladeshi patients for every 10% increase in own-ethnic density. However, the opposite effect was found for black Caribbean patients."}
{"answers": "These findings suggest a malleable relationship between knee extensor strength, dynamic stability, and disease severity in PD.

{"answers": "Findings suggest that analgesic management of daily pain is better for nursing home residents enrolled in hospice than for those not enrolled in hospice.The prescribing practices portrayed by this study reveal that many dying nursing home residents in daily pain are receiving no analgesic treatment or are receiving analgesic treatment inconsistent with AMDA and other pain management guidelines. Improving the analgesic management of pain in nursing homes is essential if high-quality end-of-life care in nursing homes is to be achieved.", "prediction_text": "Yes, receipt of hospice care in nursing homes improves the management of pain at the end of life. According to the study, hospice residents were twice as likely as non-hospice residents to receive regular treatment for daily pain, even after controlling for clinical confounders."}
{"answers": "The continuity-of-care experiences of vascular trainees are suboptimal. This is especially true for postoperative clinic assessment. Same-day admission surgery accounted for most of the cases and was associated with the poorest continuity of care. To provide complete surgical training in an era of changing therapeutic modalities and same-day admission surgery, vascular programs must be creative in structuring training to include adequate ambulatory experience.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the continuity of care experience of residents in an academic vascular department was suboptimal, with only 57% of patients receiving complete in-hospital continuity of care. Emergent cases were associated with higher rates of preoperative assessment, while elective cases admitted before the day of surgery had higher rates of preoperative assessment and involvement in the decision to operate compared to same-day admission patients. The study suggests that trainees may not be learning complete surgical care."}
{"answers": "Simple detorsion was not accompanied by an increase in morbidity, and all patients studied had functioning ovarian tissue on follow-up despite the surgeon's assessment of the degree of ovarian ischemia. Detorsion is the procedure of choice for most cases of ovarian torsion in children.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, oophorectomy is not necessary for all children with ovarian torsion. The study found that 19 out of 34 children (56%) underwent oophorectomy, while 17 out of 36 (47%) underwent detorsion with or without ovarian cystectomy. The study suggests that detorsion alone may be a viable treatment option for many children with ovarian torsion, especially those with mild to moderate ischemia. However, the study also notes that the decision to perform oophorectomy should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the"}
{"answers": "Half-dose MR angiography using diluted contrast medium injected at a rate of 1 mL/second depicted the abdominal aorta and its branches as clearly as using a full single dose.", "prediction_text": "Yes, half-dose contrast-enhanced three-dimensional MR angiography is sufficient for depicting the abdominal aorta and pelvis, according to the study. The study found that the signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio of the abdominal aorta and common iliac artery were lower in the half-dose group compared to the full dose group, but the differences were not statistically significant. This suggests that half-dose contrast-enhanced three-dimensional MR angiography can provide adequate image quality for diagnosis and treatment planning in the abdominal aorta and pelvis."}

Demonstration PSNs generated slightly greater reductions in expenditures compared to Demonstration HMOs. PSNs appear to be a promising model for delivering care to Medicaid enrollees.", "prediction_text": "Yes, provider service networks (PSNs) result in lower expenditures compared to HMOs in Florida's Medicaid program. According to the study, among Supplemental Security Income (SSI) enrollees, the Demonstration resulted in lower increases in per member per month (PMPM) expenditures over time for PSNs compared to HMOs, with a difference of $7 more in savings. Similar results were seen among Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) enrollees, but to a lesser extent."}
{"answers": "In this series, in accordance to available testosterone, the prevalence of PADAM was determined to be high, in which the ADAM questionnaire rendered a low diagnostic efficiency. PADAM diagnosis could be clinically suspected when symptoms of sexual dysfunction are present.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the Androgen Deficiency of Aging Men (ADAM) questionnaire is useful for the screening of partial androgenic deficiency of aging men. The study found that the ADAM questionnaire had a sensitivity of 83.3% and specificity of 19.7% in detecting PADAM, with item 1 (decreased sexual desire) being a better predictor of hypogonadism than the complete questionnaire."}
{"answers": "We found that intrapartum VAS was an effective predictor of fetal acidosis in cases of FHR variable decelerations, but its predictability for fetal acidosis in cases of FHR late decelerations was limited. Both VAS and fetal blood pH are good predictors of neonatal morbidity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that intrapartum vibroacoustic stimulation (VAS) is an effective predictor of fetal acidosis during labor. The study found an excellent association between the acceleration response to VAS and fetal blood pH, with a negative response to VAS (no acceleration or decelerations) predicting fetal acidosis (pH<7.20) in both term and preterm fetuses. The study also found that the positive predictive value of fetal acidosis was higher when VAS was used alone compared to when fetal heart rate (FHR) variable decelerations or late decelerations were used alone."}

Specifically, health conditions prior to baseline and during follow-ups, perception of functioning, and vasomotor symptoms (VMS) were risk factors for first-onset MDD, while being peri- and post-menopausal, psychological symptoms, and a prior anxiety disorder were predominant risk factors for MDD recurrence."}
{"answers": "Most children undergoing congenital heart surgery can be extubated in the operating room. Most neonates, including many undergoing complex procedures, can be extubated within the first 24 hours after surgery. Early extubation was associated with low morbidity rates and short lengths of intensive care unit and hospital stays.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that early extubation should be the goal for children after congenital cardiac surgery. The study found that early extubation was associated with lower mortality and a lower rate of reintubation compared to delayed extubation. In addition, the implementation of an early extubation strategy was associated with low rates of complications, short lengths of intensive care unit stay, and short hospital stays. The study found that 63% of neonates were extubated within 24 hours, including 67% of arterial switch operations and 54% of total anomalous pulmonary venous return repairs.

The study found a significant correlation between the EQ-5D index score and the MacNew subscales, with a multiple linear regression analysis showing that the MacNew global score was a significant predictor of the EQ-5D index score. These findings suggest that the EQ-5D is able to measure quality of life in patients with acute coronary syndrome."}
{"answers": "We found an improved survival associated with cardiologist care and a mixture of general practitioner and cardiologist care compared with general practitioner care. The pattern of outpatient care may therefore be important for the survival of patients with CHF.", "prediction_text": "Yes, specialty care is associated with improved survival of patients with congestive heart failure. Compared to patients who received general medicine care only, those who received care from both general medicine and cardiology specialists had the lowest mortality rate (19%), while those who received no specialty care had the highest mortality rate (29%)."}
{"answers": "Comparison of mother-offspring and father-offspring associations for BMI suggests that intergenerational acceleration mechanisms do not make an important contribution to levels of childhood BMI within the population. Associations at later ages and for different components of body composition now require study.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found evidence for an intrauterine influence on obesity. The association between maternal BMI and offspring BMI was similar to the association between paternal BMI and offspring BMI, suggesting that the mother's environment during pregnancy may play a role in shaping the child's future weight."}
{"answers": "TEE is useful to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors. An FAC less than 50% is present in 36% of potential heart donors. Because left ventricular dysfunction is often reversible shortly after transplantation, an FAC below 50% may not necessarily preclude the use of hearts for transplantation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, marginally acceptable hearts are suitable for transplantation based on the study's findings. Of the 55 potential brain-dead donors evaluated, 20 (36%) had an FAC of less than 50%, which is within the acceptable range for transplantation. Of the 40 hearts harvested, 36 were successfully transplanted, and the FAC increased significantly from 51% to 57% in the recipients. The overall actuarial survival at 1 and 2 years was 86.2% and 64.6%, respectively, in the group with acceptable hearts (FAC < 50%)."}
{"answers": "Pediatricians should be alert to the earliest manifestations of AEA. Awareness of choking games among the young and, of those, a subset who eventually progress to potentially fatal AEA is strongly encouraged among all primary care professionals who may be able to interrupt the behavior.", "prediction_text": "Yes, autoerotic asphyxiation (AEA) can lead to unintended death. The study found that AEA is a common practice among children, preteens, and adolescents, and it can be conceptualized as a personalized, ritualized, and symbolic biopsychosocial drama involving an identification and sadomasochistic relationship with a female figure. While AEA can provide a sense of pleasure, it can also result in unintended death due to miscalculation or ineptitude. Pediatricians can play a crucial role in identifying and addressing AEA among young patients, which can help prevent tragedies."}
{"answers": "The whole-body MRI protocol for the detection of bone metastases could safely be limited to the T1w sequence in adults, especially at 3 T. There is no need for an additional STIR sequence. These initial results will have a major impact on the department's workflow if confirmed by larger studies as they will help reduce examination time and therefore save financial resources.", "prediction_text": "No, STIR imaging cannot be omitted for the diagnosis of bone metastases at 1.5 T and 3 T. The study found that T1-weighted (T1w) sequences revealed a significantly higher number of metastases compared to STIR images at both field strengths (p<0.05), with a sensitivity of 99.72% and 100.00% for T1w at 3 T and 1.5 T, respectively, compared to 70.99% and 79.34% for STIR at the same field strengths. Additionally, STIR imaging detected fewer bone metastases"}
{"answers": "This study found that there was poor agreement between the AD's decision and the subsequent MR's decision regarding the fitness of those seafarers who decided to appeal against the AD's initial assessment. The reasons for this are considered.", "prediction_text": "No, approved doctors and medical referees in the UK do not agree when assessing a seafarer's fitness. The study found that the extent of agreement between the two groups was poor (Kappa K = 0.18), with a significant difference in the categorization of seafarers as \"permanently unfit\" or \"fit with restrictions.\""}
{"answers": "In our study, we suggest that glomerular hyperfiltration due to pregnancy does not have adverse effects on kidney in women with more parities. Pregnancy may have possible protective mechanisms for kidney against adverse effects of glomerular hyperfiltration.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that glomerular hyperfiltration in pregnancy damages the kidney in women with more parities. Compared to women with no or one parity, women with four or more parities had significantly higher glomerular filtration rates (GFR), indicating kidney damage. The study suggests that the increased GFR in these women may be a sign of chronic kidney damage that can lead to long-term kidney disease."}
{"answers": "Implant coating with an antibacterial-loaded hydrogel reduces bacterial colonization and biofilm formation in vitro.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that coating implants with a fast-resorbable, antibacterial-loaded hydrogel (DAC hydrogel) reduced bacterial colonization and biofilm formation in vitro."}
{"answers": "Location of death varies by country of birth. BAME groups are more likely to die in a hospital and less likely to die at home or in a hospice. Further investigation is needed to determine whether these differences result from patient-centred preferences, or other environment or service-related factors. This knowledge will enable strategies to be developed to improve access to relevant palliative care and related services, where necessary.", "prediction_text": "Yes, ethnicity affects where people with cancer die. The study found that decedents from certain ethnic groups were more likely to die in hospitals, while those from other groups were more likely to die at home. Specifically, those born in Asia and Africa were more likely to die in hospitals, while those born in the Caribbean were less likely to die in hospitals. These findings suggest that there are geographical and ethnic variations in end-of-life care for people with cancer."}
{"answers": "Overall, 7% of women in our cohort met either clinical or molecular criteria for Lynch syndrome. All of these women had a prior history or a first-degree relative with an HNPCC-associated cancer. Limiting genetic evaluation to women with synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancer who have a family history suggestive of HNPCC may appropriately identify women with Lynch syndrome.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that 5% of women with synchronous primary cancers of the endometrium and ovary have Lynch syndrome, specifically germline mutations in MSH2, MSH6, or MLH1."}
{"answers": "CMV-IgM and IgG antibodies assessment was not a potential discriminative test to identify congenitally infected newborns. In addition, low birth weight and small head circumference at birth failed to predict congenital CMV infection. CMV-DNA detection in umbilical cord blood at the time of delivery using real-time PCR of all newborns is recommended as decisive, rapid and non-invasive test.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that low birth weight is a risk indicator for congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Of the 200 newborns studied, only one had CMV-DNAemia above the adopted weight limit (>2700 gram), indicating that low birth weight may be a predictor of CMV infection."}
{"answers": "The use of instrumental variables allowed us to demonstrate a significant relationship between better ambulatory process of care and better health-related quality of life. This finding underscores the importance of efforts to improve the process of care.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that better ambulatory process of care is associated with better health-related quality of life outcomes for patients with chronic disease. Specifically, the study found that patients who received better process of care had smaller declines in health-related quality of life scores over a 30-month observation window, and that the application of the best quartile of process of care to patients currently receiving poor process was associated with a 4.24 increment in delta SF-12-physical component summary scores."}
{"answers": "To date, the newly developed Singapore equation is the most accurate BMR prediction equation in Chinese and is applicable for use in a large BMI range including those overweight and obese.", "prediction_text": "No, the current prediction equations are not applicable for estimating basal metabolic rate in Chinese adults. The study found that the newly derived equation developed from the data of 121 men and 111 women in China had a higher accuracy rate (78%) compared to existing equations such as Harris-Benedict, Henry, Liu, Yang, Owen, and Mifflin. The equation developed in the study was found to be more accurate for a BMI range greater than 23, with an accuracy rate of 76% in cross-validation. These findings suggest that the current prediction equations may not be suitable for Chinese populations and that a new equation specifically developed for this group is"}
{"answers": "This preliminary study demonstrated that OSCE ratings by LEs and REs were reasonably comparable when using checklists. Remote examination may be a feasible and acceptable way of assessing students' clinical skills, but further validity evidence will be required before it can be recommended for use in high-stakes examinations.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that remote physician-examiners can replace on-site physician-examiners in an OSCE. The study found statistically significant correlations between local examiners (LEs) and remote examiners (REs) in assessing student performance at various stations, including history taking, physical examination, and management. While the correlations were not consistently high across all stations, the study suggests that remote examination technology can be used to bridge the \"pedagogical gap\" in distributed medical education."}
{"answers": "ACR is an independent prognostic factor for maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes in suspected preeclampsia. ACR may be useful to inform risk predictions within a prognostic model.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the first urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) in women with suspected preeclampsia is a prognostic factor for both maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes. The study found that a higher ACR was associated with an increased odds of adverse maternal and neonatal composite outcomes, as well as with reduced gestational age at delivery, in multivariate analysis."}
{"answers": "The effect on venous pressures caused by the change in patient positioning alone during liver surgery does not affect the risk of venous air embolism.", "prediction_text": "No, the position of the patient during liver surgery does not influence the risk of venous air embolism, according to the study."}
{"answers": "The observations from this study provide limited support for the possibility that occupational arsenic exposure could play a role in the development of diabetes mellitus. Many other metallic compounds are also used in art glass production, however, and there is a possibility of confounding.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found an increased risk of diabetes mellitus among Swedish art glass workers, particularly among those exposed to arsenic. The odds ratio for diabetes mellitus among glassworks employees was 1.2, with a higher risk observed in combination with cardiovascular disease. The highest risk was found among unspecified glass workers, who were probably exposed to high levels of arsenic."}
{"answers": "Hospital preparedness can be better defined by a fixed number of casualties rather than a percentile of its bed capacity. Only 20% of the arriving casualties will require immediate medical treatment. Implementation of this concept may improve the utilisation of national emergency health resources both in the preparation phase and on real time.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the current readiness guidelines based on the epidemiology of encountered HMCIs are not effective in predicting the surge capacity and injury severity distribution in terrorism-related multiple casualty incidents. The study suggests that the current guidelines may overestimate the need for immediate medical treatment, as only 28% of casualties required immediate medical attention. The study recommends re-evaluating the readiness guidelines to better predict the surge capacity and injury severity distribution in such incidents."}
{"answers": "While Italian primary care physicians appropriately target eradication therapy for H pylori infection in patients with peptic ulcer disease rather than nonulcer disease, the intervention was still underused in these patients. Improvements in this prescribing behavior are needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that primary care physicians underprescribe antibiotics for peptic ulcer disease (PUD). Of the 6866 patients included in the study, only 690 (10%) received eradication therapy, with a significantly lower proportion of patients with PUD (27.6%) compared to nonulcer dyspepsia (NUD, 2%). Additionally, there was a significant difference in the proportion of patients with a definitive diagnosis receiving eradication therapy, with 37.7% of PUD patients and 20.3% of PUD patients with a presumptive diagnosis receiving therapy. These find"}
{"answers": "When cerebral hemispherectomy is performed to control seizures associated with very early (in utero) insult, it has been found that the remaining right hemisphere is still able to support reading and phonological processing skills that are normally mediated by the left hemisphere. Our results also suggest the existence of variability in individuals after hemispherectomy, even within groups having the same etiology and similar timing of insult.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the isolated right hemisphere can read. The study found that about 60% of participants developed both word reading and paragraph reading in the average range, despite the fact that the left hemisphere was resected. Additionally, phonological awareness and verbal memory, which are components of phonological processing, were found to positively correlate with reading levels, suggesting that these skills are preserved in the right hemisphere after hemispherectomy."}
{"answers": "Improved office-based practices regarding influenza vaccination could significantly impact Healthy People 2020 goals by increasing influenza vaccine uptake and reducing corresponding racial and ethnic disparities.", "prediction_text": "Yes, routine offering of influenza vaccination in office-based settings can reduce racial and ethnic disparities in adult influenza vaccination. Eliminating \"missed opportunities\" for vaccination in these settings could cut racial and ethnic disparities in vaccination by roughly half."}
{"answers": "The SPI was accurate in predicting the presence or absence of esophageal varices in patients with compensated cirrhosis.", "prediction_text": "Yes, non-invasive diagnosis of esophageal varices in patients with compensated hepatic cirrhosis is possible by duplex Doppler ultrasonography. The study found that the splenic index (SPI) was the most accurate parameter for predicting the presence of esophageal varices, with a cut-off value of SPI at 5.0 offering the highest diagnostic accuracy. Of the 28 patients with SPI <5.0, 27 had no esophageal varices, with a high negative predictive value and sensitivity. Similarly, of the 28 patients with SPI \u22655.0, 22"}
{"answers": "This study showed for the first time that RALP induces lower tissue trauma than RRP.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that robotically assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) is less invasive than retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP) based on the levels of inflammatory markers (IL-6 and CRP) and lactate in the blood samples collected during and after surgery. The study found that RALP resulted in lower levels of IL-6 and CRP at various time points after surgery, and lower levels of lactate at the end of surgery and 12 hours after surgery. These findings suggest that RALP may be associated with less tissue damage and inflammation compared to RRP"}
{"answers": "The researchers studied a defined skin care protocol using a cleanser with aloe vera and a cleansing lotion, followed by application of either a moisture barrier with silicone or skin protectant with zinc oxide and menthol, undertaken at two different frequencies. Data revealed the incidence of moderate IAD was decreased in the experimental group (receiving the skin protocol every 6 hours and p.r.n.).", "prediction_text": "Yes, the frequency of skin care affects the severity of incontinence-associated dermatitis in critically ill patients. The study found that the intervention group, which received skin care every 6 hours, had a significantly lower incidence and severity of IAD compared to the control group, which received skin care every 12 hours."}
{"answers": "Patient coaching offers promise as a means of reducing racial/ethnic disparities in pain control. Larger studies are needed to validate these findings and to explore possible mechanisms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patient coaching can reduce racial/ethnic disparities in cancer pain control. The study found that minority patients who received individualized education and coaching sessions had significantly less pain at the 2-week follow-up compared to those in the control group, and the effect of the intervention was significant in reducing disparities."}
{"answers": "The association between plasma glucose levels and CVD risk is mainly explained by insulin resistance, which raises the question of whether glucose lowering per se without changes in the processes that underlie hyperglycemia should be the sole clinical paradigm in the treatment of type 2 diabetes or its prevention.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that insulin resistance drives the association between hyperglycemia and cardiovascular risk. The findings indicate that while both fasting and 2-hour plasma glucose levels are associated with higher Framingham risk score, the effect of fasting glucose becomes non-significant after adjusting for insulin sensitivity. Similarly, the association between 2-hour glucose and Framingham risk score disappears after adjusting for insulin sensitivity. However, insulin sensitivity remains significantly associated with Framingham risk score even after adjusting for glucose levels. These results suggest that insulin resistance plays a key role in the"}
{"answers": "Tracheobronchoscopy is a useful and safe procedure and should be recommended in tertiary centers for babies with EA before surgical repair.", "prediction_text": "Yes, preoperative tracheobronchoscopy (TBS) matters in newborns with esophageal atresia (EA). The study found that TBS was clinically useful in 45.2% of patients, including 24.2% of infants, in modifying the surgical approach. The procedure helped identify unsuspected fistulas and malformations of the respiratory tree, allowing for better diagnosis and treatment. No complications were observed. In conclusion, TBS is a valuable tool in the management of EA, particularly in identifying previously undetected anomalies that can impact surgical approach and outcomes."}
{"answers": "The recently released seventh edition of the primary tumor staging system for kidney tumors is a powerful predictor of CSS. However, some of the substages identified by the classification have overlapping prognoses, and other substages include patients with heterogeneous outcomes. The few modifications included in this edition may have not resolved the most critical issues in the previous version.", "prediction_text": "Yes, further improvements are needed. The study found that the 2009 TNM version was not able to accurately predict cancer-specific survival (CSS) in all subgroups of patients, including those with pT2b and pT3a tumors. The study suggests that the novel classification of the primary tumor was a powerful independent predictor of CSS, but the substratification of pT1 tumors did not retain an independent predictive role. These findings suggest that the current TNM staging system may not be adequately capturing the complexity of kidney cancer and that further improvements are needed to better predict patient outcomes."}
{"answers": "The Young-Burgess system is useful for predicting transfusion requirements. For the system to predict mortality or nonorthopaedic injuries, fractures must be divided into stable (APC1, LC1) and unstable (APC2, APC3, LC2, LC3, VS, combined mechanism of injury) types. LC1 injuries are very common and not always benign (overall mortality rate, 8.2%).", "prediction_text": "Yes, the Young-Burgess classification system predicts mortality, transfusion requirements, and non-orthopaedic injuries in patients with pelvic ring fractures. However, the system's ability to predict mortality only approached statistical significance, and it was not as useful at predicting head, chest, or abdomen injuries. Dividing fractures into stable and unstable types improved the system's ability to predict mortality rates, abdomen injury rates, and transfusion requirements. Overall mortality in the study group was 9.1%, which was unchanged from original Young-Burgess studies 15 years previously."}
{"answers": "Parity is not directly linked to insulin sensitivity deterioration, to CP/FPG increase during pregnancy, or to GDM appearance, although it is linked through the mediation of progressive ageing and weight gain either before or during pregnancy, when there is a sufficiently long time interval between pregnancies.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that parity (number of previous pregnancies) is associated with increased insulin resistance during pregnancy, as measured by the peripheral insulin sensitivity index (ISI(OGTT)) and the risk of gestational diabetes (GDM). Specifically, the study found that women with three or more parities had lower ISI(OGTT) and higher CP/FPG (a proxy for beta-cell function) compared to nulliparous women. Additionally, the study found that GDM was significantly related to parity and age, but not to pregestational body mass index (BMI) or weight gain."}
{"answers": "The relationship between cognitive functioning and recognition of frequency compressed speech-in-noise was not statistically significant. The findings may have been different if the participants had been provided with training and/or time to 'acclimatize' to the frequency-compressed conditions.", "prediction_text": "Yes. The study found a statistically significant relationship between cognitive function and frequency-compressed speech recognition in listeners with normal hearing and normal cognition, with better cognitive function associated with better speech recognition in the unprocessed condition but not in the frequency-compressed conditions."}
{"answers": "We conclude that beta1Gly49 homozygosity and TACC haplotype of ADRB2 gene, both loss-of-function genetic variations, may predispose to TTN.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that polymorphisms in the beta-adrenergic receptor (ADRB) encoding genes, specifically the beta1Gly49 homozygotes, are associated with an increased risk of transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN)."}
{"answers": "MSWM does not appear to confer additional benefit as compared to the standard preoperative bariatric surgery protocol in terms of weight loss and most behavioral outcomes after LAGB in our patient population.", "prediction_text": "No, participation in a preoperative medically supervised weight loss program (MSWM) does not improve bariatric surgery outcomes, including weight loss, patient adherence, eating behavior, patient activation, and physical activity, according to the study's findings."}
{"answers": "TAVI can be performed safely without balloon predilatation and with the same early results as achieved with the standard procedure including balloon predilatation. The reduction in the number of pacing periods required may be beneficial for the patient.", "prediction_text": "No, predilatation cannot be omitted in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVI) according to the study."}
{"answers": "In our study; sex is not a significant predictor of recanalization rate, time to recanalization or 3-month outcome in stroke patients following IV rt-PA.", "prediction_text": "No, the sex of acute stroke patients does not influence the effectiveness of rt-PA. According to the study, there was no significant difference in recanalization rates or clinical outcomes at 3 months between men and women receiving IV rt-PA."}
{"answers": "Serum sample might be alternatively used in the difficult time of getting tumor tissue for analyzing the status of EGFR mutation status in patients with advanced NSCLC.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that serum can be used for analyzing the EGFR mutation status in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The study found that EGFR mutations were detected in the serum samples of 11 patients and in the tumor samples of 12 patients, with a high correlation between the mutations detected in serum and the mutations detected in the matched tumor sample (correlation index 0.62; P<0.001). Additionally, the response to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors was significantly associated with EGFR mutations in both tumor samples and serum samples (P<0.05). These"}
{"answers": "Although the provision of high-quality evidence-based resources, electronic or otherwise, is essential for standardizing care and improving patient outcomes, the authors' findings demonstrate that this alone does not ensure uptake. It is important to understand end-users, the environment in which they operate, and the basic infrastructure required to implement such a system. Implementation must also be accompanied by continuing education and endorsement to ensure both long-term sustainability and use of the system to its full potential.", "prediction_text": "Yes, Web-based systems can play a major role in standardizing care in medical oncology, but factors such as clinician attitudes, hospital policies, and infrastructure availability can impact their use and adoption."}
{"answers": "This study has shown that being SGA was not a significant risk factor for any stage ROP or for severe ROP in this cohort and, also, that the risk factors for ROP were similar among SGA and AGA very-low-birth-weight preterm babies.", "prediction_text": "Yes, being small for gestational age (SGA) is a risk factor for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). According to the study, SGA infants had a higher prevalence of ROP compared to appropriate for gestational age (AGA) infants. After adjusted logistic regression analysis, weight gain from birth to sixth week of life and need for blood transfusions were found to be significant risk factors for ROP in both groups, with SGA infants having a higher risk of ROP than AGA infants."}
{"answers": "Frequent consumption of hamburgers showed a dose-dependent association with asthma symptoms, and frequent takeaway consumption showed a similar association with BHR.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that frequent consumption of hamburgers and takeaway foods is associated with an increased risk of wheeze and current wheeze in children. Specifically, compared to children who never ate hamburgers, those who consumed them less than once a week and 1+ times a week had a higher risk of wheeze and current wheeze. However, there was no effect on atopy."}
{"answers": "In patients with limb-threatening ischemia and lack of venous material for a straightforward venous femorocrural bypass, semi-closed endarterectomy of the superficial femoral artery combined with a short popliteo-crural bypass provides a good alternative.", "prediction_text": "Yes, semi-closed endarterectomy of the superficial femoral artery combined with a short venous bypass is an acceptable alternative for limb-threatening ischemia in cases where there is insufficient venous material for a straightforward femorocrural reconstruction. According to the study, the cumulative primary patency rate was 60.3% at 1 year and 48.4% at 3 years, and the limb salvage rate was 68.6% at both 1 and 3 years. These results suggest that the procedure is effective in maintaining blood flow to the affected limb and preserving limb function."}
{"answers": "Although the SLBM is quite repeatable, it underestimates mesopic pupil size and shows a too wide range of agreement with CIP. SLBM shows low sensitivity in detecting pupils larger than 6\u00a0mm, which may be misleading when planning anterior segment surgery. Previous grading-consensus training strategies may increase interrater reproducibility, and compensation for the systematic underestimation could improve accuracy of the SLBM.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study concludes that the cobalt blue light slit-lamp biomicroscopy method (SLBM) can measure mesopic pupil size. The mean difference between SLBM and Colvard infrared pupillometry (CIP) was -0.60 mm and -0.30 mm for each examiner using the average of the three readings, and they were very similar using the first reading. The intraobserver reproducibility of SLBM was excellent, with an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.97, and the interobserver reproducibility was also good, with an ICC of 0."}
{"answers": "Although there are different patterns of atrophy across the different FTLD-TDP types, it appears that genetic and pathologic factors may also affect the patterns of atrophy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that TDP-43 type confers a distinct pattern of atrophy in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). The study identified different patterns of atrophy across the three TDP-43 types (1, 2, and 3), with each type showing distinct patterns of brain atrophy. Specifically, type 1 showed frontotemporal and parietal atrophy, type 2 predominantly anterior temporal lobe atrophy, and type 3 predominantly posterior frontal atrophy. Additionally, the study found that within the type 1 group, subjects with a progranulin mutation had significantly more lateral temporal"}
{"answers": "A set of educational interventions designed for cancer patients significantly improved their satisfaction with information on clinical research, but did not improve clinical trial enrollment of these participants as of 1 year after the study.", "prediction_text": "No, increased patient awareness does not improve accrual into cancer-related clinical trials."}
{"answers": "There was little evidence that people at high risk of falls received systematic falls risk assessment during rehabilitation. When a risk was identified, generally a strategy was implemented. However, failure to assess some risk factors might have limited fall prevention strategies offered. Failure to adequately address risks during hospitalization could contribute to falls post-discharge. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2016; 16: 570-576.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that discharge documentation did not correctly identify falls risk for the majority of patients at high risk. Only nine of the 50 patients had their falls risk accurately identified in their discharge documentation. Additionally, there was limited assessment of falls risk factors such as osteoporosis, footwear, and visual assessment in the previous 2 years. The study suggests that there is a gap in meeting the guidelines for preparing patients at high risk of falls for discharge home after rehabilitation."}
{"answers": "Although most Medicare beneficiaries who received a new CIED between 2005 and 2009 did not have an initial in-person CIED follow-up visit within 2 to 12 weeks after device implantation, the rate of initial follow-up improved appreciably over time. This CIED follow-up visit was significantly more common in white patients than in patients of other races.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, experts' recommendations for follow-up of patients with new cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) are not fully implemented in routine clinical practice. The study found that only 42.4% of eligible patients had an initial in-person visit within 2 to 12 weeks after implantation, and the rate of follow-up within 0 to 16 weeks and 1 year improved but still fell short of the recommended guidelines."}
{"answers": "According to our study, there is a great variability when different brands and models of scanners are compared directly. Furthermore, the CT scan analysis and HU evaluation appears to gather insufficient information in order to characterize and identify the composition of renal stones.", "prediction_text": "The study found that there are significant differences in the mean CT attenuation values obtained with different CT scanner models, which can lead to pitfalls in urinary stone identification using CT attenuation values. The study showed that some stone types had mean CT attenuation values that were significantly different between scanner models, and that the Philips Brilliance model had mean values that were equal to those obtained with the Siemens Sensation and Toshiba Aquilion models. The study suggests that the use of different CT scanner models can result in different information being obtained, which can impact the accuracy of urinary stone identification."}
{"answers": "Ophthalmic pathology and basic science research show that SBK and ASA are improvements in excimer laser keratorefractive surgery compared to conventional LASIK or PRK, particularly with regard to maintaining corneal biomechanics and perhaps moderately reducing the risk of corneal haze. However, most of the disadvantages caused by wound healing issues remain.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a difference in the biomechanical and wound healing characteristics of corneas after excimer laser keratorefractive surgery between advanced surface ablation (ASA) and sub-Bowman's keratomileusis (SBK). The study found that ASA resulted in stronger and more rigid corneas, particularly in the anterior and peripheral regions, compared to SBK. This suggests that ASA may be biomechanically safer than SBK in reducing the risk of keratectasia after surgery. However, both techniques still have limitations in terms of inadequate reparative wound healing, which can lead to cor"}
{"answers": "The Internet would be a practical and accessible way of delivering sexual health education to young people, particularly if it is incorporated into activities and websites they enjoy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the Internet can be used to improve sexual health awareness in web-wise young people. According to the study, 62.4% of participants said they would use a GUM website, and a \"question line\" where they could e-mail questions to a health care professional was of interest to 70.4% of participants. These findings suggest that young people are open to using the Internet for sexual health information and support."}
{"answers": "Ultrasound not only has comparable sensitivity to that of X-ray for the identification of limb fractures but is also equally effective for the diagnosis of fracture type and dislocation. Thus, ultrasound can be used as an adequate alternative method to X-ray for pediatric fracture diagnosis.", "prediction_text": "No, ultrasound is not equal to X-ray in pediatric fracture diagnosis. The study found that X-ray was superior to ultrasound in the detection of fracture type, with 80 correct results using X-ray compared to 66 correct results using ultrasound. However, ultrasound was superior to X-ray for dislocation identification, with 51 correct results using ultrasound compared to 41 correct results using X-ray."}
{"answers": "Although initial infection control rate was substantially lower in the retention group than the removal group, final results were comparable at latest followup. We believe retention treatment can be selectively considered for non-S. aureus infection, and when applied in selected patients, polyethylene exchange should be performed.", "prediction_text": "No, the study does not support the recommendation of implant retention for the treatment of infected TKA. The study found that the infection control rate was lower in the retention group compared to the removal group, and the only factor associated with infection control was the type of treatment (retention versus removal). Additionally, the study identified Staphylococcus aureus infection and polyethylene nonexchange as contributing factors for failure of infection control in the retention group. These findings suggest that implant retention may not be an effective treatment option for infected TKA."}
{"answers": "The observed socioeconomic, demographic and microbiological differences between unmarried and married women could be responsible for the poor pregnancy outcome among unmarried pregnant women in Poland. Unmarried pregnant women should be covered by comprehensive medical care even before pregnancy. Further studies taking into account the role of psychological stress, patterns of sexual behavior and substance abuse during pregnancy could help identify the factors responsible for adverse pregnancy outcome among unmarried pregnant women.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that microbiological factors, specifically the presence of Mycoplasma hominis, account for poor pregnancy outcome among unmarried pregnant women in Poland. The unmarried status was found to be a borderline risk factor for BV, and the presence of M. hominis was identified as an independent risk factor for poor pregnancy outcome among unmarried women."}
{"answers": "In conclusion, concept mapping has a positive effect on students' academic achievement. These findings could provide valuable evidence for establishing concept mapping as a continuous teaching strategy for nursing students.", "prediction_text": "Yes, concept mapping enhances the learning outcomes of nursing students. The study found that the mean scores for cumulative tests were higher in the group that engaged in map construction compared to the group that only took quizzes. Additionally, there was a gradual increase in the mean scores of developed maps during the eight sessions of intervention."}
{"answers": "In this nationally representative population-based survey, HCMV seropositivity is associated with hypertension in women in the NHANES population. This association is largely explained by the association of hypertension with age and the increase in past exposure to HCMV with age.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is associated with hypertension in women, particularly in those aged 16-49 years. After adjusting for various factors, the association remained significant, with HCMV seropositivity being associated with a 1.55-fold increased risk of hypertension in women. However, the association was not significant after adjusting for age."}
{"answers": "Although the cost-effectiveness of a single-pill strategy was within the acceptable willingness-to-pay threshold, the QALY difference were minimal. Further research is recommended to explore the long-term impact of the strategy.", "prediction_text": "No, combining antiretroviral agents in a single dosage form does not significantly enhance the quality of life of HIV/AIDS patients. According to the study, the mean utility gained by using the FXD treatment over the FRC treatment was 0.085, but this difference was not statistically significant."}
{"answers": "2ME is able to enhance the antiproliferative activity of certain chemotherapeutics at pharmacological relevant concentrations. This estradiol metabolite is currently in a phase II trial in patients with refractary metastatic breast cancer and the tolerability has been shown to be very good. The combination of 2ME with chemotherapeutics may therefore offer a new clinically relevant treatment regimen for hormone-dependent cancer.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the combination of 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME) with certain chemotherapeutic compounds can result in an additive inhibitory effect on the proliferation of human ovarian cancer cells, potentially reducing the dosages of chemotherapy needed for treatment. Specifically, the study found a significant additive effect of 2ME with epirubicine and carboplatin in both human ovarian cancer cell lines at lower concentration ranges of these chemotherapeutic substances."}
{"answers": "Follow-up after endometrial cancer treatment varies in Italy. In this retrospective study, women with asymptomatic recurrence have shown a better clinical outcome compared with those with symptomatic relapse. The optimal approach is actually unknown, and guidelines comparing follow-up protocols have not been established. Prospective cost-effectiveness studies are needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that different follow-up modalities can play a role in the diagnosis of asymptomatic endometrial cancer relapses. The study found that among the 165 asymptomatic patients, 60 (36.4%) were detected through a clinical visit alone, 103 (62.4%) through imaging, and 2 (1.2%) through cytologic examination. These findings suggest that a combination of different follow-up modalities may be more effective in detecting asymptomatic relapses than relying on a single modality."}
{"answers": "Lower Infundibular height could be a good measurement tool for deciding which patients with lower calyceal lithiasis would benefit from SWL treatment. Height of less than 22 mm suggests a good outcome from lithotripsy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, infundibular height can predict the clearance of lower pole calyceal stones after extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy. According to the study, patients with a higher infundibular height had a lower likelihood of stone clearance after treatment."}
{"answers": "The interval from the onset of clinical symptoms to the initial surgical intervention seems to be the most important prognostic factor with a significant impact on outcome. Despite extensive therapeutic efforts, Fournier's gangrene remains a surgical emergency and early recognition with prompt radical debridement is the mainstays of management.", "prediction_text": "Yes, Fournier's gangrene is still dangerous. The mortality rate in the study was 36%, with 5 out of 14 patients dying. The risk of mortality was significantly associated with a higher leukocyte count."}
{"answers": "These four cases may belong to a variant form of HAM/TSP, predominantly involving the cervical cord levels.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that chronic progressive cervical myelopathy in patients with HTLV-I infection may be a variant form of HTLV-I-associated myelopathy (HAM)/tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP). The study found that two of the three patients examined had high risk of developing HAM/TSP in virologic and immunologic aspects, and biopsied spinal cord lesions showed inflammatory changes in one patient. These findings support the idea that HTLV-I infection may play a role in the development of chronic progressive cervical myelopathy."}
{"answers": "The results of the current study demonstrated that there are factors that increase the risk of a leakage which would enable surgeons to define risk groups, to more carefully select patients, and to offer a closer follow-up during the postoperative course with early recognition and adequate treatment. All future efforts should be focused on a further reduction of serious complications to make the LSG a widely accepted and safer procedure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found several risk factors that increase the rate of staple line leakage in patients undergoing primary sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity. These include male gender, higher BMI, concomitant sleep apnea, conversion to laparotomy, longer operation time, use of both buttresses and oversewing, and the occurrence of intraoperative complications. On multivariate analysis, only operation time and year of procedure were found to have a significant impact on staple line leak rate."}
{"answers": "Font influenced pregnant women's ratings of intervention complexity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the content and presentation of participant information sheets (PISs) can significantly influence recruitment and participation for an antenatal intervention. The study found that pregnant women rated the Double Awkward condition as more complex than the other conditions, which may deter them from participating in the intervention. Similarly, trainee midwives also rated the Awkward Title-Fluent Font condition as more complex, which may affect their willingness to recruit participants for the intervention. These findings suggest that the processing fluency of PISs can have a significant impact on recruitment and participation for an antenatal intervention."}
{"answers": "Results of this survey highlight the wide variety of practice patterns in the US for handling surgical margins in breast-conservation treatment. This issue remains controversial, with no prevailing standard of care. Consequently, additional study is needed in the modern era of multimodality treatment to examine the minimal amount of surgical treatment necessary, in conjunction with chemotherapy and radiation, to attain adequate local control rates in breast-conservation treatment.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no consensus among breast surgeons regarding the acceptable margins for negative breast-conservation operations, as there was a large range of answers in the survey regarding acceptable margins for ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive carcinoma."}
{"answers": "The findings showed that acupuncture of voice-related acupoints could bring about improvement in vocal function and healing of vocal fold lesions.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that acupuncture is efficacious for treating phonotraumatic vocal fold lesions. Both the genuine and sham acupuncture groups showed significant improvement in vocal function and perceived quality of life, but only the genuine acupuncture group demonstrated structural improvements in the reduction of vocal fold lesions."}
{"answers": "A policy of early cesarean delivery in eclampsia, carrying \u226534 weeks, is not associated with better outcomes.", "prediction_text": "No, the route of delivery does not significantly affect maternal and perinatal outcomes in women with eclampsia."}
{"answers": "Based on data derived from self-reported health conditions, and not withstanding the limitations of such a study, we conclude that there is good evidence to suggest that individuals with moderate to severe periodontal disease are at higher risk of suffering from rheumatoid arthritis and vice versa.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant relationship between rheumatoid arthritis and periodontal disease. The study found that individuals with rheumatoid arthritis were more likely to have periodontal disease, with a prevalence of 3.95% in the test group compared to 0.66% in the control group and 1% in the general population. Additionally, among patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 62.5% had advanced forms of periodontal disease."}
{"answers": "Present audit shows that the process of implementation of labor analgesia was quick, successful and safe, notwithstanding the identification of one cluster of women with suboptimal response to epidural analgesia that need to be further studies, overall pregnant womens'adhesion to labor analgesia was satisfactory.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the standard of effective analgesia for epidural analgesia during childbirth is not fully reachable in all women. Although the use of epidural analgesia increased from 15.5% to 51% during the study period, there were still significant variations in the effectiveness of labor analgesia, with a hierarchical clustering analysis identifying two clusters based on VAS time course. Cluster 1 had a more rapid decrease in VAS scores from before to after epidural analgesia, while cluster 2 had a slower decrease and a lower overall level of satisfaction. These findings suggest that while some women may benefit from epidural analgesia"}
{"answers": "The residency training sites of the Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine provide patient care opportunities similar to those found in a national survey of family and general practitioners.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the patient characteristics and reasons for visits at the ambulatory teaching centers of the seven community-based university-affiliated family practice residency programs in northeast Ohio were found to be similar to those of family physicians (FPs) and general practitioners (GPs) in the 1990 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS). The residency training sites saw slightly more children, women, blacks, and Medicare and Medicaid patients, but the most common reason for an office visit was an undifferentiated symptom in both populations. Additionally, the top 20 \"reason for visit\" codes and diagnoses were identical or similar between the"}
{"answers": "Our findings suggest that, in HT+ postmenopausal women, the rs2813544 polymorphism may influence LDL-C levels and, as previously described, ESR2 rs1256049 is associated with T-chol and LDL-C. No previous study has investigated the association of this SNP set with lipoprotein levels in women while taking into account the hormonal status of the patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, polymorphisms in the oestrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) and oestrogen receptor 2 (ESR2) genes are associated with lipid levels in response to hormone therapy (HT) in postmenopausal women. Specifically, the ESR1 rs2813544 polymorphism was associated with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in HT-treated postmenopausal women, while one ESR2 gene haplotype was associated with total cholesterol (T-chol) and LDL-C in HT-treated postmenopausal women."}
{"answers": "The prevalence of PAD is high in nursing home residents. AAI is not predictive for IHD mortality in this population. In very frail elderly traditional risk factors and PAD are less important predictors of death compared to poor functional status, nutritional factors and previous cardiovascular disease.", "prediction_text": "No, the presence of PAD was not related to total mortality or to mortality for ischemic heart disease (IHD), cerebrovascular disease or other causes in this study."}
{"answers": "The data demonstrate that vaccination has a relatively weak and short-lasting effect in old age. The results of the study should stimulate discussions about strategies how vaccinations can be made more effective in old age. Improved campaigns, shortened vaccination intervals as well as the design of novel vaccines tailored to fulfill the specific demands of the aging immune system are imaginable.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that vaccine protection in Austrian seniors is often inadequate. The study showed that many elderly individuals were not vaccinated according to recommended strategies, and even among those who were vaccinated, low antibody concentrations and short durations of protective humoral immunity were observed in many individuals, both frail and healthy."}
{"answers": "The introduction of a discharge coordinator improved the quality of discharge planning, but at additional cost.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that the introduction of a dedicated discharge coordinator improved the quality of hospital discharge. The coordinator resulted in a reduction in problems experienced by patients after discharge, and in perceived need for medical and healthcare services."}
{"answers": "Local anesthesia is not required to lower a patient's pain intensity when applying intra-articular contrast media for MR arthrography of the shoulder. This could result in reduced costs and a reduced risk of adverse reactions, without an impact on patient comfort.", "prediction_text": "No, the study suggests that local anesthesia is not necessary for MR arthrography of the shoulder. The mean pain level in the group that received local anesthesia (group A) was similar to the mean pain level in the groups that did not receive local anesthesia (groups B and C) (p>.05)."}
{"answers": "A routinely inserted ENBD tube did not improve the clinical course, despite patients having to endure increased procedure time and discomfort, and the insertion would therefore be unnecessary.", "prediction_text": "No, it is not necessary to insert a nasobiliary drainage tube routinely after endoscopic clearance of the common bile duct in patients with choledocholithiasis-induced cholangitis. The study found no significant difference in the recurrence rate of cholangitis or length of hospital stay between the group that received an endoscopic nasobiliary drainage (ENBD) tube and the group that did not receive one. However, the procedure time and discomfort score were higher in the ENBD group. These findings suggest that the routine insertion of an ENBD tube after endoscopic clearance of the common b"}
{"answers": "Regarding the pedigree, we discuss different modes of inheritance. The presence of consanguineous unions in this family suggests the possibility of a common ancestor and thus a recessive autosomal mode of inheritance.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is an inheritance pattern of nasal polyposis (NP) in this family. The study found that 19.7% of individuals older than 17 years were affected by NP within the family, which is significantly higher than the national French prevalence of 2.1%."}
{"answers": "Emergency DBE is feasible, safe and effective in acute OGIB and may avoid major surgery, diagnosing and successfully treating most patients. Combined approach with RT viewing by CE is especially useful to identify recurrent bleeding vascular lesions such as DL that may be easily misdiagnosed by non-emergency DBE.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that emergency double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) combined with real-time viewing of capsule endoscopy (CE) is a feasible approach in the management of acute overt-obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB). The study found that emergency DBE in patients with overt OGIB was successful in diagnosing and treating 23 lesions amenable to endoscopic hemostasis, with a higher detection rate of Dieulafoy's lesions (DL) in the emergency DBE group compared to OGIB patients with DBE done 24 hours after symptom onset. Additionally"}
{"answers": "Laparoscopic antireflux surgery significantly improved quality of life in reflux patients whose symptoms were well controlled on medical therapy. Although on the basis of a noncomparative trial with a relatively short follow-up period, we believe such patients should be considered for laparoscopic antireflux surgery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, laparoscopic antireflux surgery improves quality of life in patients with well-controlled gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) who prefer surgery over continued medical therapy. The study found significant improvements in physical, mental, and gastrointestinal symptom quality of life scores after surgery compared to preoperative levels."}
{"answers": "Patients in regional and rural settings were willing partners in developing skills of junior medical students, who had greater involvement in patient consultations than previously reported for urban students. Our study extends the findings from urban general practice that patients are underutilised partners in community-based medical training. The support of patients from regional and rural settings could facilitate the expansion of primary care-based medical education in these areas of workforce need.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that patients are willing participants in the new wave of community-based medical education in regional and rural Australia. The majority of patients surveyed (99%) were positive about their doctor and practice being involved in student teaching, and they felt they played an important role in the educational process. While some patients initially expressed reluctance to allow students to conduct certain aspects of the consultation independently, most reported they would have accepted higher levels of involvement after the consultation."}
{"answers": "Overall, in a US Air Force population, OSA does not predict a decrease in aerobic fitness as measured by cycle ergometry. However, patients with an apnea-hypopnea index of greater than 20 have a statistically significant decrease in aerobic fitness compared to the normal population. This study demonstrates the effects of OSA on aerobic fitness. Further correlation of fitness testing results with OSA severity and treatment is needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) affects aerobic fitness. Patients with OSA have an objective increase in VO2max compared to a normal population, but individuals with an apnea-hypopnea index of greater than 20 have a decreased VO2max compared to normalized values."}
{"answers": "Pictorial HWLs with didactic textual forms seem to work better than those with testimonial narratives. Future research should determine which pictorial HWL content has the greatest real-world impact among consumers from disadvantaged groups, including assessment of how HWL content should change to maintain its impact as tobacco control environments strengthen and consumer awareness of smoking-related risks increases.", "prediction_text": "Yes, pictorial warning labels on cigarette packages can address smoking-related health disparities, particularly among individuals with higher levels of educational attainment. The study found that didactic textual forms were more effective than testimonial forms in terms of credibility, relevance, and impact, and that graphic imagery of diseased organs was more effective than imagery of human suffering. These findings suggest that pictorial warning labels can be an effective tool in reducing smoking rates and addressing smoking-related health disparities among different populations."}
{"answers": "Preferential transmission of AVPR1A to hypersexual or uninhibited people-seeking probands was not supported.", "prediction_text": "No, the arginine vasopressin V1a receptor microsatellites were not found to be related to hypersexuality in children with a prepubertal and early adolescent bipolar disorder phenotype in this study. The transmission disequilibrium test and case-control analyses did not reveal any significant associations between the number of AVPR1A GATA or complex repeats and hypersexuality or uninhibited people-seeking in the study population."}
{"answers": "We suggest that regardless of family history, all children over 5 years should be screened for hyperlipidemia. Education about hyperlipidemia and precautions for its complications should be given to both children and families. The best and easiest way to reach children is to screen them at schools. School is also a good place for education of children about hyperlipidemia and risk factors.", "prediction_text": "No, family history is not a reliable indicator for cholesterol screening in school children. The study found no significant relations between family history of hyperlipidemia and serum lipid levels in the children."}
{"answers": "These data indicate digoxin use may be associated with a reduction in risk of PCa. Given the potential mechanisms by which digoxin may exert an anti-neoplastic effect and other recent studies showing a negative association between digoxin use and PCa, further research is warranted.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that use of digoxin for cardiovascular disease is associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer. In multivariate analysis, digoxin use was associated with a reduction in the odds ratio of prostate cancer, with a stronger reduction observed among those with \u22653 PSA tests over the preceding 5 years."}
{"answers": "GHD men receiving GH treatment have a mortality rate not different from the background population. In women, after exclusion of high-risk patients, mortality was not different from the background population except for CVD. Mortality due to malignancies was not elevated in adults receiving GH treatment. Next to gender, the heterogeneous etiology is of influence on mortality in GHD adults with GH treatment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, growth hormone replacement therapy reduces mortality in adults with growth hormone deficiency. According to the study, the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for all-cause mortality was 1.27 (95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.56) in the treatment group compared to the expected mortality, indicating a reduced risk of death. This effect was observed in women, with a higher SMR for cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality after excluding high-risk patients. Mortality due to malignancies was not elevated. In contrast, mortality was not different from the background population in the control"}
{"answers": "It seems quite admissible and justified to encourage medical students to officiate as examiners in undergraduate emergency medicine OSCE formative testing, but not necessarily in summative assessment evaluations.", "prediction_text": "Yes, student examiners (SE) can be a reasonable substitute for faculty examiners (FE) in an undergraduate OSCE on medical emergencies. The study found that students in the SE track performed significantly better in certain OSCE stations, such as Trauma Management (TM), Airway Management (AM), and Obstetrical Emergencies (OE), and had a higher overall OSCE score compared to the FE track. However, the effect sizes were small. In the post-assessment evaluation portion of the study, students gave higher ratings for the ACS station and \"overall OSCE evaluation\" in the FE track, but the effect sizes were also small. These findings"}
{"answers": "Expression of ER is a constitutional feature of the connective tissue and smooth muscle cells of the anal continence organ. Estrogen receptors and PR are not detectable in the striated muscle fibers of the external anal sphincter in either sex. The presence of ER in the stroma and smooth muscles of the anal canal suggests that these tissues are targets for estrogen. This constitutes a theoretical basis for the beneficial effects of estrogen and progestin replacement on anal continence in postmenopausal women.", "prediction_text": "The study found that hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone) are present in the tissues of the anal canal, specifically in smooth muscle cells of the internal sphincter and perimuscular connective tissue in females, and in smooth muscle cells of the internal sphincter in males. The presence of these receptors suggests that hormonal influences may play a role in anal continence in women, with about 50% of ER-positive tissues also positive for PR. The study implies that hormonal modulation of anal smooth muscle tone may be an important factor in the development and maintenance of anal incontinence, particularly in women."}
{"answers": "In women with bothersome MUI, concomitant AA repair does not result in additional improvement in OAB symptoms over MUS alone. Patients with postoperative complications exhibit less improvement in OAB symptoms.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that concomitant anterior/apical repair during midurethral sling does not improve the overactive bladder component of mixed incontinence. The primary outcome, OAB-q SS change score, showed no significant differences between the MUS-only and MUS + AA cohorts (p = 0.20)."}
{"answers": "An association was found between sublingual varices and hypertension. Examining the lateral borders of the tongue is easily done, causes no harm and could be a valuable method for the dental profession to take active part in preventive healthcare.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a connection between sublingual varices and hypertension. The study found an association between the presence of sublingual varices and hypertension, with an odds ratio of 2.25 and a p-value of <0.002. Additionally, the study found that patients with grade 1 sublingual varices had higher mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared to those with grade 0 varices. The positive predictive value of sublingual varices for hypertension was 0.5, and the negative predictive value was 0.80."}
{"answers": "Our data suggested that visually impaired pedestrians can make accurate and reliable street crossing decisions like those of normally sighted pedestrians. When using auditory information only, all subjects significantly overestimated the vehicular gap time. Our finding that blind pedestrians performed significantly worse than either the normally sighted or visually impaired subjects under the hearing only condition suggested that they may benefit from training to improve their detection ability and/or interpretation of vehicular gap times.", "prediction_text": "Yes, normally sighted and visually impaired pedestrians were accurate and reliable in their street crossing decision-making ability when using either vision plus hearing or vision only. However, blind pedestrians were the least accurate under the hearing only condition."}
{"answers": "Initial single scrotal incision can be recommended for orchidopexy, even in the more difficult cases of impalpable undescended testes. Advantages seem to include shorter operative time, a cosmetically appealing single incision, and possibly less pain. The scrotal incision technique significantly reduces the need for laparoscopy in impalpable testes. Surprisingly, it even allows successful orchidopexy of abdominal testes, provided an open processus is present.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that the scrotal approach should be considered as the first choice for both palpable and impalpable undescended testes. The study found that in 78% of impalpable cases, the testes could be diagnosed and treated successfully using only a scrotal incision, with a limited number of postoperative complications. These findings support the use of the scrotal approach as a valid and effective alternative to laparoscopy for the management of undescended testes."}
{"answers": "Center differences in enteral feeding advancement occur and may have a significant impact on short-term outcomes such as nosocomial sepsis. Large, multicenter, prospective trials are required to further elucidate the optimal feeding strategy for VLBW infants.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the enteral feeding advancement affects short-term outcomes in very low birth weight infants. VLBW infants born in centers with slow advancement (SA) had a higher rate of sepsis, particularly late-onset sepsis, compared to those born in centers with rapid advancement (RA). Additionally, more central venous lines and antibiotics were used in centers with SA."}
{"answers": "There appears to be no difference in the numbers of emboli detected when the first vascular clamp is applied to the proximal aorta or iliacs.", "prediction_text": "No, the sequence of clamp application during open abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery does not influence distal embolization. The study found no significant difference in the number of emboli detected between the groups that had the proximal aorta clamped first versus the iliac vessels clamped first. Additionally, there was no correlation between the number of emboli and dissection time. However, there was a higher number of emboli in the sub-group of current smokers."}
{"answers": "GP hospitals seem to reduce the utilisation of general hospitals with respect to admissions as well as occupied bed days.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that populations with access to general practitioner hospitals (GP hospitals) utilize general hospitals less than populations without such access. The total rate of admission to general hospitals was lower in peripheral municipalities with a GP hospital than in central municipalities without this kind of institution, with differences of 26-52% for men and women respectively. The differences were most pronounced for certain diagnoses, such as respiratory diseases, cardiac failure, cancer, stroke, and fractures, where patients are regularly transferred from general hospitals to GP hospitals for longer term follow-up care."}
{"answers": "The EBP unit was associated with better patient outcomes and more efficient performance than achieved by the same physicians previously or by SP concurrently.", "prediction_text": "Yes, evidence-based practice (EBP) improves patient outcomes. The study found that patients treated by EBP doctors had a lower risk of death (6.27% vs 7.75%, P < 0.001) and shorter length of stay (6.01 vs 8.46 days, P < 0.001) compared to patients treated by standard practice (SP) doctors. No significant improvements were seen in SP doctors' performance."}
{"answers": "Although travel burden is associated with timely diagnosis and treatment for some types of cancer, we did not find evidence that driving time was, in general, better at predicting timeliness of cancer diagnosis and treatment than driving distance. More intensive efforts at early detection of breast cancer and early treatment of CRC for Medicaid patients who live in remote areas may be needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, distance to provider is a barrier to care for Medicaid patients with breast, colorectal, or lung cancer. The study found that later stage at diagnosis for breast cancer patients and longer time-to-treatment after diagnosis of CRC patients are associated with travel burden, indicating that distance to provider is a significant barrier to timely diagnosis and treatment."}
{"answers": "Our results indicate that training managers in transformational leadership behaviours may have a positive impact on healthcare workers' health over time. However, more research is needed to examine the mechanisms by which transformational leadership brings about improved sleep quality; self-efficacy was not found to be the explanation.", "prediction_text": "No, self-efficacy does not mediate the relationship between transformational leadership behaviors and healthcare workers' sleep quality."}
{"answers": "The use of US helps in making a correct diagnosis and in the follow-up with objective criteria and also convinces the patient and the family that the treatment needs to be continued.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that ultrasound can be used for the diagnosis and follow-up of constipation in children. The study found that there was a positive correlation between rectal diameter and age, height, weight, and bladder capacity, and a significant difference in rectal diameter between constipated and control groups. The cutoff point of rectal diameter for a diagnosis of constipation was determined as 2.44 cm, with a sensitivity of 71% and specificity of 76%. Additionally, the study showed that there was a significant decrease in constipation score and fecal load after treatment for a month, but the rectal diameter had not yet reached normal limits"}
{"answers": "Brachytherapy with ruthenium applicators is an effective therapy for small- and medium-size posterior uveal melanomas. Our results are comparable to other series. The treatment outcome does not seem to be capable of improvement by increasing the apical dose. An internationally accepted model for defining the dosage in brachytherapy is needed.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, escalation of the apical dose did not significantly improve treatment outcomes in beta-radiation of posterior choroidal melanomas with 106Ru plaques. The overall 5-year survival rate and disease-specific 5-year survival rate were similar in both the 100 Gy and 160 Gy groups (90% and 92%, respectively). The study found that local control was achieved in 90% of patients with conservative therapy alone, regardless of the apical dose. The main side effects were uncomplicated retinopathy in 30% of cases, with macular degeneration"}
{"answers": "The addition of epinephrine to ACLS-SAPO increases vital organ perfusion pressures and improves outcome from cardiac arrest. There appears to be a profound loss of arterial vasomotor tone after prolonged arrest. This loss of vasomotor tone may make exogenous pressors necessary for resuscitation after prolonged cardiac arrest.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, a pressor is not necessary during aortic perfusion and oxygenation therapy of cardiac arrest. The study found that infusion of epinephrine during SAPO resulted in higher aortic pressures, but did not improve the rate of return of spontaneous circulation. In contrast, the placebo group had a lower rate of return of spontaneous circulation. These findings suggest that a pressor may not be necessary during SAPO, as it may actually hinder the effectiveness of the therapy."}
{"answers": "In a leading specialty journal, cited reviewers gave higher scores than noncited reviewers. However, this\u00a0was likely due to their being assigned higher-quality manuscripts and not because they were cited in the manuscript. Reviewer requests that their work be cited were rare.", "prediction_text": "Yes, reviewers' scores are influenced by citations to their own work. The study found that manuscripts that contained citations to the reviewer's work received higher evaluations than those that did not, and reviewers were more likely to suggest adding citations to their own work than to other work. After controlling for manuscript quality, the unadjusted odds ratio for the manuscript desirability score was 1.6, indicating that citations to the reviewer's work were associated with higher scores."}
{"answers": "Preoperative education delivered by nurses reduced anxiety and postoperative complications of patients undergoing cardiac surgery, but it was not effective in reducing readmissions or length of stay.", "prediction_text": "Yes, nurse-led preoperative education can reduce anxiety and postoperative complications of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The study found that patients who received preoperative education by specially trained nurses had lower levels of state anxiety on the day before surgery and during the follow-up period compared to those who received standard information from ward personnel. Additionally, the intervention group had a lower proportion of chest infections. Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that education and trait anxiety scale score on admission were independent predictors of a reduction in state anxiety."}
{"answers": "Improving hospital efficiency by shortening length of stay does not appear to result in increased rates of readmission or numbers of physician visits within 30 days after discharge from hospital. Research is needed to identify optimal lengths of stay and expected readmission rates.", "prediction_text": "No, discharging patients earlier from Winnipeg hospitals does not adversely affect quality of care. The study found that decreasing lengths of stay over time for selected diagnostic categories was not associated with increased hospital readmission rates or mean number of physician visits after discharge. In fact, the readmission rates for some categories (such as uterine or adnexal procedures) actually decreased over time. The study suggests that shorter lengths of stay may not negatively impact quality of care, and may even lead to better outcomes for some patients."}
{"answers": "Solitary kidney in a canine model is more resistant to ischemia than paired kidneys based on radiological, pathological and genetic evidence.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that a solitary kidney is not more resistant to warm ischemia compared to a paired kidney. In fact, the study showed that a solitary kidney is more susceptible to ischemic damage, with a greater reduction in clearance and more pronounced tubular necrosis than a paired kidney. The expression of proinflammatory markers was also higher and more sustained in the solitary kidney group."}
{"answers": "Elective re-siting of intravenous cannulae every 48 hours results in a significant reduction in the incidence and severity of PVT. We recommend that this should be adopted as standard practice in managing all patients who require prolonged intravenous therapy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, elective re-siting of intravenous cannulae every 48 hours decreases the incidence and severity of peripheral thrombophlebitis (PVT) in patients receiving intravenous fluids/drugs."}
{"answers": "We conclude that 3-phase bone scintigraphy prior to surgery could be a useful method to determine the amputation level in a diabetic foot. We conclude that further, comparative, more comprehensive, long-term, and controlled studies are required.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that 3-phase bone scintigraphy is a useful method for determining amputation levels in diabetic foot. The study found that scintigraphy was able to accurately identify the level of amputation in 90% of patients, with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 90%. Additionally, the study found that scintigraphy was able to identify amputation levels that were not visible on Doppler ultrasound. The study concludes that scintigraphy can be a valuable tool in determining amputation levels in diabetic foot, and may help to improve treatment outcomes by allowing for more accurate assess"}
{"answers": "At baseline assessment patients of lower socioeconomic status showed lower health related quality of life. Since there was no clear trend at follow-up assessment this suggests that patients from different socioeconomic status responded to treatment similarly. In general, the findings suggest that quality of life is not only the outcome of the disease and its treatment, but is also highly dependent on each patients' socioeconomic characteristics.", "prediction_text": "Yes, socioeconomic status (SES) matters in quality of life (QoL) in lung cancer patients. At baseline, patients of lower SES had more health problems, less functioning, and more symptoms compared to affluent patients. However, there was no significant difference between patient groups at follow-up."}
{"answers": "General surgery research residents' intraoperative leadership skills showed significant correlations to their perceptions of skill decay and task difficulty during a bowel repair. Evaluating resident's directional instructions may provide an additional individualized intraoperative assessment metric. Further evaluation relating to operative performance outcomes is warranted.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found a significant relationship between residents' leadership skills and their technical skills. Specifically, residents who rated lower levels of decay in their intraoperative decision-making and small bowel repair skills were found to use their assistants more by giving more instructions during the simulated surgical procedure. Additionally, a higher number of instructions was associated with lower perceived difficulty in selecting the correct suture, suture pattern, and completing the entire surgical task."}
{"answers": "The severity of TAI is influenced by the sharpness of the aortic arch. There is an inverse relationship between the severity of aortic injury and the aortic arch index.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the anatomy of the aortic arch significantly influences the severity of traumatic aortic injury (TAI). The study found that the aortic arch angle was significantly associated with the occurrence of type III damage, with a higher angle corresponding to a higher risk of severe injury."}
{"answers": "Clinical variables, either isolated or as components of a model, could not identify all children with pathologic radiographs.", "prediction_text": "No, clinical variables do not accurately predict pathologic radiographs in the first episode of wheezing."}
{"answers": "The results showed no overall first night effect on severity of RMMA frequency in young and healthy patients with SB. In clinical practice, one-night sleep recording may be sufficient for moderate-high frequency SB patients. However, low RMMA frequency in the first night could be confirmed by a second night based on the patient's medical and dental history.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a first night effect on sleep bruxism. The study found that while there was no significant difference in overall sleep variables such as total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and stage transitions between the two nights, there were significant time and group interactions for some sleep bruxism variables, including the burst index, bruxism time index, and mean burst duration. Specifically, the second night showed higher values in these variables compared to the first night, indicating a first night effect on sleep bruxism."}
{"answers": "Athletes engaged in competitive sports are more likely to develop ventricular arrhythmias during exercise. These arrhythmias subside over time when athletes are engaged in non-competitive sports.", "prediction_text": "Yes, ventricular arrhythmias in athletes tend to subside over time. According to the study, athletes who experienced ventricular arrhythmias during their initial exercise test had fewer arrhythmias during their follow-up test, with a significant decrease in the number of athletes who experienced ventricular premature beats (VPB) and/or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT)."}
{"answers": "A well developed collateral circulation does not predict an increased risk of restenosis after PCI.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that a well-developed collateral circulation does not predispose to restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In fact, the study found that patients with good collaterals had more severe coronary stenoses at baseline compared to those with poor collaterals. Additionally, restenosis rates were similar in both groups. The study did not find any correlation between collateral flow and restenosis, and multivariate analysis revealed that stent diameter, stent length, residual stenosis, and smoking history were the only predictors of restenosis."}
{"answers": "We conclude that patient and graft survival on transplanting kidneys from elderly donors to young recipients is superimposable on that obtained with young donors. However, renal function is better in the group of young donors.", "prediction_text": "No, it is not appropriate to implant kidneys from elderly donors in young recipients based on the study's findings. The study found that the survival rate of the graft and the recipient was significantly lower in the group that received kidneys from elderly donors compared to the group that received kidneys from younger donors. Specifically, the 10-year survival rate of the graft was 76.6% in the elderly donor group versus 94.4% in the younger donor group, and the 10-year survival rate of the recipient was 76.6% versus 98.8%. Additionally, the"}
{"answers": "Many patients do not understand their ED care or their discharge instructions. Moreover, most patients appear to be unaware of their lack of understanding and report inappropriate confidence in their comprehension and recall.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, patients are not always aware of when they do not understand their emergency department (ED) care and instructions. The study found that 78% of patients demonstrated deficient comprehension in at least one domain, with 51% of patients having deficiencies in two or more domains. However, only 20% of patients perceived difficulty with comprehension, indicating that they were not aware of their lack of understanding."}
{"answers": "The results of this study suggest that normothermic CPB does not prevent the development of the \"euthyroid sick syndrome\" during and after CPB. Despite these changes in thyroid function, most patients in both groups had a normal postoperative recovery.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, cardiopulmonary bypass temperature does not affect the development of postoperative euthyroid sick syndrome. The study found that both hypothermic and normothermic CPB resulted in reduced levels of total thyroxine (TT4) and total triiodothyronine (TT3) beginning with CPB and persisting for up to 5 days after CPB, but the incidence of postoperative euthyroid sick syndrome was similar in both groups. Additionally, the study found that free T3 was reduced for up to 3 days after CPB, and mean serum reverse T3 was elevated on postoperative days 1 and 3,"}
{"answers": "Severe hypoglycaemia is associated with an increased risk for CV outcomes in people at high CV risk and dysglycaemia. Although allocation to insulin glargine vs. standard care was associated with an increased risk of severe and non-severe hypoglycaemia, the relative risk of CV outcomes with hypoglycaemia was lower with insulin glargine-based glucose-lowering therapy than with the standard glycaemic control. Trial Registration (ORIGIN ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00069784).", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that severe hypoglycaemia was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, including the composite of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke, mortality, CV death, and arrhythmic death."}
{"answers": "EDWS is a safe and effective treatment for esophagogastric varices secondary to portal hypertension in selected patients. Patients treated with EDWS had a lower complication rate of portal venous system thrombosis compared with those treated with conventional MED.", "prediction_text": "Yes, esophagogastric devascularization without splenectomy (EDWS) is safe and effective in the treatment of portal hypertension. The study found that the morbidity rate of portal venous system thrombosis was significantly lower in the EDWS group compared to the modified esophagogastric devascularization (MED) group. Additionally, the 1- and 3-year recurrence rates of esophagogastric variceal hemorrhage were lower in the EDWS group compared to the MED group."}
{"answers": "Significant postoperative pain can be expected in the following situations: pain after prior surgery, presence of chronic pain sustained for more than six months, intense preoperative pain, state of depression.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the postoperative pain level can be predicted preoperatively based on the following factors: prior history of surgical pain, duration of prior pain, intensity of preoperative pain, and depression."}
{"answers": "The general practice selection process is predictive of future performance in the MRCGP.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that general practice selection scores predict success at the MRCGP examination. The overall selection score and scores from each individual stage of selection were found to be significantly correlated with examination performance, with a strong correlation coefficient of 0.491 for the AKT and 0.526 for the CSA (P<0.01)."}
{"answers": "Although the association of prostate and lung cancer is uncommon, the possibility of synchronous tumors should be considered in patients with urinary and pulmonary symptoms suggestive of neoplasm. It is important to determine if the lesion is a metastasis, since the prognosis depends on the second tumor.", "prediction_text": "According to the research paper, the authors found that prostatic syndrome and pleural effusion are not different diseases, but rather different manifestations of the same underlying disease process. The study found that in patients with both prostate and lung cancer, the pleural effusion was often a sign of advanced disease and was frequently associated with metastasis to other sites, including the bones and liver. The authors concluded that prostatic syndrome and pleural effusion are not distinct entities, but rather part of a continuum of disease progression in patients with prostate cancer."}
{"answers": "The practice of intensive observation for the first transfusion in pediatric patients is probably unnecessary.", "prediction_text": "No, intensive monitoring during the first transfusion in pediatric patients is not necessary, based on the study's findings. Of the 150 patients who experienced acute reactions during transfusions, only 8.7% had clinically mild reactions during their first transfusion, and none required ICU management. In contrast, 3.4% of patients experienced severe reactions during subsequent transfusions. These findings suggest that temporary ICU admission for the first transfusion is not warranted, as the majority of mild reactions can be managed on a regular ward."}
{"answers": "There is no indication of a rebound aggravation of symptoms 12 to 14 days after a 5-day treatment with lansoprazole 60 mg once daily in patients with reflux symptoms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, short-term treatment with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) such as lansoprazole can cause rebound aggravation of symptoms."}
{"answers": "Our long-term study showed significantly better (2-fold) results regarding the continence score for the abdominal approach compared with the transanal pull-through. The stool pattern and enterocolitis scores were somewhat better for the TERPT group. These findings raise an important issue about the current surgical management of HD; however, more cases will need to be studied before a definitive conclusion can be drawn.", "prediction_text": "No, the long-term results of the transanal endorectal pull-through (TERPT) are not equal to those of the transabdominal (ABD) pull-through for the treatment of Hirschsprung disease (HD). The study found that the continence score was significantly better in the ABD group, while the stool pattern score was better in the TERPT group."}
