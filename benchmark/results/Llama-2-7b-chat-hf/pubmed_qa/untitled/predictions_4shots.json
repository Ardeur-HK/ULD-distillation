{"answers": "These data suggest that being willing and fit enough for a chemotherapy protocol is a good prognostic factor for invasive bladder cancer. This eligibility bias emphasizes the need for prospective, randomized trials, and indicates that single-group studies using historical or matched controls have to be interpreted with caution.", "prediction_text": "Yes, eligibility for an adjuvant chemotherapy protocol after radical cystectomy is a good prognostic factor for invasive bladder cancer. The study found that patients who were eligible for the protocol had better overall survival, recurrence-free survival, and lower rates of tumor progression and cancer-related death compared to those who were not eligible."}
{"answers": "An additional delayed phase through the abdomen in routine contrast-enhanced CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis is of low yield, particularly if reliable follow-up imaging to further elucidate uncertain findings is available.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that delayed imaging in routine CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis may not be worth the additional cost of radiation and time for most patients. While there were a few incidental findings that were only visible in the delayed phase, the majority of patients (95.8%) did not benefit from the additional imaging. In fact, the use of the delayed phase resulted in a significant increase in effective radiation dose. Therefore, the authors recommend that radiologists and clinicians should carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks of delayed imaging before performing it in routine CT examinations."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that the SCL 90-R is best viewed as an indicator of unidimensional emotional distress and somatic effects of structural brain injury.", "prediction_text": "No, the SCL 90-R obsessive-compulsive dimension does not identify cognitive impairments in individuals with brain tumors. The subscale was only related to symptoms of depression, anxiety, and subjective complaints of memory problems, but not to objective measures of attention, verbal memory, or age."}
{"answers": "The results suggest that NA treatment can be stopped in selected patients with CHB as long as they are not cirrhotic, have completed a minimum period of treatment, have normal ALT and sustained undetectable DNA. These patients should be closely monitored during the first year and then indefinitely.", "prediction_text": "Yes, it is possible to stop treatment with nucleos(t)ide analogs in patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B, but the rate of virological relapse is high, with 54.54% of patients experiencing a relapse within 6 months after discontinuation."}
{"answers": "The results of this study do not support the hypothesis that there is a direct link between atmospheric pressure values and abdominal aortic aneurysm ruptures.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the diameter of the aneurysm is important in determining the influence of atmospheric pressure on aortic aneurysm rupture. The study found that larger aneurysms (>7 cm) were more likely to rupture in situations where the atmospheric pressure increased between the day before the rupture and the day of the rupture, and this trend was more pronounced in patients with hypertension."}
{"answers": "Findings from these studies support discordance between device-recorded and self-reported hot flashes. In addition, the studies reveal further limitations of SSC monitoring, including difficulties with data collection and lack of consistency in interpretation. Based on these results and other recent trials identifying issues with SSC methodology, it is time to find a better physiologic surrogate measure for hot flashes.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the sternal skin conductance (SSC) device may not be a reliable measure of hot flashes, with a concordance rate of only 24% between self-reported and device-recorded hot flashes. While the device was considered acceptable by some women, technical issues and interference with daily activities were reported. Therefore, the SSC device may not be a reasonable surrogate for hot flash measurement."}
{"answers": ": Prophylactic fixation with a cephalomedullary nail was not found to be cost-effective for the average older woman who sustained a hip fracture. However, it may be appropriate for select patient populations. The study supports the need for basic science and clinical trials investigating the effectiveness of prophylactic fixation for patient populations at higher lifetime risk for contralateral hip fracture.", "prediction_text": "Prophylactic fixation of the uninjured hip is not cost-effective in the base-case analysis for a 79-year-old woman, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $142,795 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. However, prophylactic fixation may be a cost-effective method to prevent contralateral hip fracture in certain subgroups, such as women aged 71-75 years with a 30% greater relative risk for a contralateral fracture, or women younger than age 70 years. The cost-effectiveness of prophylactic"}
{"answers": "We found that USMLE Step 2, number of honors in medical school clerkships, and AOA membership demonstrated the strongest correlations with resident performance. Our goal in analyzing these data was to provide residency programs at large a sense of which criteria may be \"high yield\" in ranking applicants by analyzing data from within our own pool of residents. Similar studies across a broader scope of programs are warranted to confirm applicability of our findings. The continually emerging complexities of the field of orthopaedic surgery lend increasing importance to future work on the appropriate selection and training of orthopaedic residents.", "prediction_text": "Yes, preresidency selection criteria can predict performance in orthopaedic surgery residency. Specifically, objective measures of resident knowledge and performance, such as USMLE Step 2 scores and ABOS Part I scores, are moderately correlated with preresidency selection criteria. Subjective ratings by faculty, such as global evaluation scores and faculty rankings, are also influenced by preresidency selection criteria, with AOA membership being associated with higher scores in these areas."}
{"answers": "In vitro fertilization outcome is strongly correlated with both maternal ages, basal cycle, day 3 follicle, stimulated hormone, and antral follicle assessment. Antral follicle assessment was a better predictor of in vitro fertilization outcome than were age or follicle stimulated hormone. Antral follicle assessment may provide a marker for ovarian age that is distinct from chronological age or hormonal markers.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that baseline antral follicle assessment may be a better predictor of in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcome than maternal age and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels. The clinical pregnancy rate was significantly higher in the group with baseline antral follicle >6 compared to those with antral follicle < or = 6, even after controlling for patient age and basal FSH levels. Additionally, the cancellation rate was significantly higher in the group with baseline antral follicle < or = 6 compared to those with antral follicle > or = 6"}
{"answers": "Neither insertion of PEG tubes nor timing of insertion affect survival.", "prediction_text": "No, feeding tube insertion and its timing do not improve survival in patients with advanced cognitive impairment and new problems eating. After adjusting for selection bias using propensity score weights, there was no difference in survival between residents who had a feeding tube inserted within 1 year of developing eating problems and those who did not. Additionally, the timing of PEG tube insertion relative to the onset of eating problems was not associated with survival."}
{"answers": "In this well established early discharge program with nurse home visits, newborn metabolic screening is not compromised by early discharge.", "prediction_text": "Yes, early discharge with nurse home visits affects the adequacy of newborn metabolic screening. Early discharge infants had a higher rate of initial filter paper specimens being inadequate, but a higher rate of repeat specimens when the initial specimen was inadequate, and were more likely to have an adequate specimen within the first 9 days of life."}
{"answers": "The palliative treatment concept of 25\u00a0Gy applied in 5\u00a0fractions is sufficient for radiation of lung cancer, given that there was no obvious survival improvement in patients treated with the higher total dose regimen.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no significant benefit in overall survival for palliative lung cancer patients who receive high-dose radiotherapy (50 Gy in 20 fractions) compared to those who receive lower dose radiotherapy (25 Gy in 5 fractions). In fact, the median survival time was shorter for the high-dose group in patients with a poor overall condition."}
{"answers": "Although elevated leukocyte count and CRP value cannot effectively establish the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the elderly, unelevated values exclude it. Accordingly, appendectomy is not recommended to be performed in an elderly patient with unelevated leukocyte count and CRP value, although clinical symptoms and signs indicate acute appendicitis.", "prediction_text": "The study found that there was no statistically significant difference in leukocyte counts or CRP values between patients with an uninflamed appendix and those with acute appendicitis in the elderly population. However, the study did find that there were no patients in the acute appendicitis group with both leukocyte count and CRP values that were unelevated, suggesting that both markers may have a role in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the elderly."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrates that in patients at risk for cardiac morbidity undergoing vascular surgery, desflurane is effective to control intraoperative hypertension without fear of major cardiac depressant effect.", "prediction_text": "Yes, desflurane can alter left ventricular function when used to control surgical stimulation during aortic surgery. The study found that the addition of desflurane to control hypertension during surgery resulted in an increase in afterload, as measured by systemic vascular resistance index, end-systolic wall stress, and left-ventricular stroke work index. However, there were no changes in heart rate, cardiac index, mean pulmonary arterial pressure, stroke volume, end-diastolic and end-systolic cross-sectional areas, fractional area change, or left ventricular circumferential fiber shortening."}
{"answers": "Development of tolerance to gluten seems possible in some patients with CD. Further follow-up will show whether this tolerance is permanent or only a long-term return to latency. This feature may be associated with genetic characteristics, especially with HLA genotypes that differ from DQ2 or DQ8. More insight into the mechanisms of the development of gluten tolerance may help to distinguish those CD patients that might not require life-long GFD.", "prediction_text": "Of the 53 patients with biopsy-proven CD who were followed for 20 years or more, 23% had a gluten-containing diet, 15% admitted gluten transgression, and 62% followed the gluten-free diet (GFD). Only two patients were considered to have developed tolerance to gluten, and one of them was HLA-DQ2/DQ8 negative."}
{"answers": "No home-prepared replacement milks in South Africa meet all estimated micronutrient and essential fatty acid requirements of infants aged<6 months. Commercial infant formula is the only replacement milk that meets all nutritional needs. Revisions of WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF HIV and infant feeding course replacement milk options are needed. If replacement milks are to provide total nutrition, preparations should include vegetable oils, such as soybean oil, as a source of linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids, and additional vitamins and minerals.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF-recommended replacement milks for infants of HIV-infected mothers in a rural region of South Africa are not entirely appropriate in terms of nutritional adequacy, cost, and preparation time. While the milks provided some essential nutrients, they were often inadequate in terms of vitamins and minerals, and the preparation process was time-consuming. Additionally, the cost of the ingredients for home-prepared replacement milks was found to be more affordable than commercial formula. Overall, the study suggests that the WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF"}
{"answers": "We have shown that eosinophilic inflammation of the airway wall may increase PD and that the association of eosinophil counts with ICSs may result in lessening the PD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) appear to affect the perception of dyspnea during bronchoconstriction in asthma patients. In the study, ICS-treated patients had lower VAS scores for dyspnea during a methacholine-induced FEV1 decrease compared to ICS-naive patients. Additionally, eosinophil counts and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) were found to be negatively associated with PD in ICS-treated patients, while eosinophil counts were positively associated with PD in ICS-naive patients. These findings suggest that ICSs may have a"}
{"answers": "High socioeconomic status was associated with a higher acceptance rate of preventive home visits, but the association was attenuated by invitational procedures. The results indicate that the social inequality in acceptance of publicly offered preventive services might decrease if municipalities adopt more proactive invitational procedures.", "prediction_text": "Yes, acceptance rates of a national preventive home visit program for older people are socially imbalanced, with older people from higher socioeconomic backgrounds (i.e. those with high financial assets) more likely to accept the program than those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. The association between socioeconomic status and acceptance was attenuated when adjusting for invitational procedures, suggesting that the way in which the program is promoted and invitations are issued may influence the acceptance rates."}
{"answers": "In the present study, FT and androstenedione were statistically significantly correlated with sexual desire in the total cohort of women. ADT-G did not correlate more strongly than circulating androgens with sexual desire and is therefore not superior to measuring circulating androgens by mass spectrometry.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a correlation between androgens and sexual desire in women. The study found that sexual desire correlated with circulating androgens, such as total testosterone (TT), calculated free testosterone (FT), androstenedione, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), in both the total cohort of women and in a subgroup of women aged 25-44 years. Additionally, in women aged 45-65 years, androstenedione correlated with sexual desire. However, the study did not find a correlation between the level of the primary androgen metabolite, androsterone glucuronide ("}
{"answers": "The results of these analyses suggest that marginally higher rates of depression to age 35 amongst the comorbid MD/AUD group were explained by increased exposure to adverse childhood circumstances amongst members of the comorbid group. Adolescent MD/AUD comorbidity is likely to be a risk marker, rather than a causal factor in subsequent MD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, comorbidity between major depression (MD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD) in adolescence is associated with poorer outcomes of MD in adulthood, after adjusting for confounding factors such as gender, childhood behavior problems, and exposure to abuse."}
{"answers": "There are no statistically apparent motion differences between SUP-CTV and INF-CTV. Current uniform planning target volume (PTV) margins are adequate to cover both portions of the CTV.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no statistically significant difference in target motion between the superior and inferior portions of the clinical target volume (PB-CTV) in the study population."}
{"answers": "Combined end points for adverse events are acceptable in the octogenarian. Carotid endarterectomy remains the gold standard for treatment of extracranial carotid disease in all age groups. Age alone should not place patients in the high-risk category for carotid endarterectomy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, octogenarians (patients aged 80-89 years) are considered high-risk for carotid endarterectomy due to the presence of associated risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, and history of smoking. The study found that 4 perioperative neurologic complications occurred in octogenarians, including 1 transient ischemic attack, 2 minor strokes, and 1 major stroke."}
{"answers": "Lysosomotropic amines in combination with cyclosporine appear to be synergistic in the suppression of T-cell proliferation to MiHC and MHC. Use of chloroquine in combination with cyclosporine may result in improved control of GVHD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, synergy exists between lysosomotropic amines (such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) and cyclosporine in suppressing T-cell responses to minor and major histocompatibility antigens in mice. The combination of these two drugs results in additive or synergistic immunosuppression, leading to decreased T-cell proliferation and activation."}
{"answers": "The results of this study suggest that the cardiovascular response to exercise training may be different in men and women. Women may benefit more from interventions aimed to increase physical activity as a tool for prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.", "prediction_text": "Yes, exercise training has a significant effect on heart rate and QT interval in healthy young individuals, with trained individuals showing lower heart rate and higher heart rate variability compared to sedentary subjects. Additionally, there are gender differences in the effects of exercise training on the QT/RR slope, with a more pronounced effect in women."}
{"answers": "Although BD is correlated with GCS at presentation and RTS, it is not a reliable prognostic marker for outcome and mortality in patients with isolated TBI.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no statistically significant difference in means of base deficit between survivors and non-survivors in patients with isolated severe traumatic brain injury."}
{"answers": "\"Aquagenic maladies\" could be a pediatric form of the aquagenic urticaria.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the paper suggests that syncope during bathing in infants can be a form of water-induced urticaria, similar to aquagenic urticaria. The study found that all six infants in the study had dermographism, and there was an increase in blood histamine levels after a trial bath in two of the infants. The evolution of the \"aquagenic maladies\" was favourable after a few weeks without baths, but three out of seven infants continued to suffer from troubles associated with sun or water after a 2-7 year follow-up."}
{"answers": "Laparoscopic procedures caused detectable damage to Kupffer and endothelial cells as reflected by elevation of post-operative HA serum levels. The damage to the liver hepatocytes and perisinusoidal cells has no clinical significance and the laparoscopic procedure itself is the probable cause of the Kupffer and endothelial cells damage, while other mechanisms caused damage to the hepatocytes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, laparoscopic cholecystectomy appears to influence peri-sinusoidal cell activity, as evidenced by the significant increase in serum hyaluronic acid (HA) levels in patients who underwent the procedure."}
{"answers": "Sleep disorders are common in the general adult population of Japan. Correction for reporting heterogeneity using anchoring vignettes is not a necessary tool for proper management of sleep and energy related problems among Japanese adults. Older age, gender differences in communicating sleep-related problems, the presence of multiple morbidities, and regular exercise should be the focus of policies and clinical practice to improve sleep and energy management in Japan.", "prediction_text": "Yes, adjustment for reporting heterogeneity is necessary in sleep disorders. The study found that after adjusting for reporting heterogeneity, age, the number of comorbidities, and regular exercise were significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems, while sex was no longer a significant factor. The use of anchoring vignettes in the CHOPIT model allowed for the estimation of these associations while accounting for the non-response bias caused by differences in response category cut-points for each individual."}
{"answers": "Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is often challenging in men on account of more adhesions and inflammation. This leads to higher conversion rates and more postoperative complications. Optimized planning and a more experienced operating surgeon may help overcome these problems.", "prediction_text": "Yes, sex affects the outcome of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Male patients have a higher conversion rate, longer operating time, and a higher incidence of bile duct injuries, gallbladder perforation, and gallstone spillage compared to female patients. However, there were no significant differences in mean hospital stay, wound infection, and port-site herniation between men and women."}
{"answers": "To uphold the notion for radiation exposure to be as low as reasonably achievable, ureteroscopic stone retrieval can safely be done without the use of fluoroscopy in a significant number of patients.", "prediction_text": "No, fluoroscopy is not essential for the retrieval of lower ureteric stones in this study. Complete clearance without the use of fluoroscopy was achieved in 94.2% of patients, and fluoroscopy was only required in 4% of patients for specific reasons such as calcified strictures, duplex systems, narrow and tortuous meatus, and confirmation of spontaneous passage of the stone."}
{"answers": "Surrogates of injury severity, including days in the ICU and non-ICU hospital LOS>10 days, were associated with the development of HO in our cohort of acetabular fracture patients. Prophylaxis with XRT was significantly protective against the development of HO, and the ability to provide prophylaxis is very likely related to the severity of injury.", "prediction_text": "Yes, surrogates of injury severity, such as length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU, and the use of external radiation beam therapy (XRT), were found to be significantly associated with the development and severity of heterotopic ossification (HO) in patients with acetabular fractures treated with a posterior approach."}
{"answers": "In this series of 35 patients, the use of epidural analgesia for HIPEC does not seem to be associated with a worse risk of haemodynamic instability, spinal haematoma, meningitis or epidural abscess. HIPEC with platinum salt is not incompatible with the safety of epidural analgesia, with an optimized fluid management peroperatively and the following of perimedullary anesthesia practice guidelines.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found no evidence of a significant risk of spinal haematoma, meningitis, or epidural abscess when using epidural analgesia for surgical treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis. However, there was a slight increase in thrombopenia and leukopenia in some patients."}
{"answers": "The Diabeo system improved glycaemic control in both high and low users who avidly used the IDA function, while the greatest improvement was seen in the low users who had the motivational support of teleconsultations.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that technology alone may not be sufficient to improve glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes, as the improvement in HbA1c levels was similar in both the high and low user groups, despite the former group using the IDA function and teleconsultations more frequently."}
{"answers": "Despite a lower risk of breast cancer, the Sami attended the NBCSP more frequently than the control group. The recall and cancer detection rate was lower among the Sami compared with the non-Sami group.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that the attendance rate and outcome of the Norwegian Breast Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP) were lower in the Sami-speaking municipalities compared to a control group of non-Sami municipalities. Specifically, the attendance rate in the NBCSP was 78% in the Sami population and 75% in the non-Sami population, and the recall rates were 2.4% and 3.3% in the Sami and non-Sami populations, respectively. Additionally, the rate of invasive screen-detected cancer was not significantly lower in the Sami group, but the percentage of all breast cancers detected in the NBCSP"}
{"answers": "GP ablation did not prove to be beneficial for postoperative stable NSR. A complete left atrial lesion set and biatrial ablation are advisable for improving rhythm outcomes. Randomized controlled trials are necessary to confirm our findings.", "prediction_text": "No, ganglionated plexi ablation during Maze IV procedure does not appear to be beneficial for postoperative long-term stable sinus rhythm."}
{"answers": "It is concluded that serum pancreatic lipase is a more accurate biomarker of acute pancreatitis than serum amylase.", "prediction_text": "Based on the study, serum pancreatic lipase may be a more accurate biomarker than serum amylase for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for serum pancreatic lipase was higher than that for serum amylase, indicating better diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, a lower proportion of acute pancreatitis patients had elevated serum amylase but not serum pancreatic lipase, suggesting that serum pancreatic lipase may be more specific for this condition. However, further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these findings and establish the clinical usefulness of serum pan"}
{"answers": "Transgastric endoscopic splenectomy in a porcine model appears technically feasible. Additional long-term survival experiments are planned.", "prediction_text": "Yes, per-oral transgastric splenectomy is technically feasible using a flexible endoscope in a porcine model. The study demonstrated that the procedure can be performed without complications during gastric incision and entrance into the peritoneal cavity, and visualization of the spleen and other intraperitoneal organs was good. The splenic vessels were successfully ligated and the spleen was mobilized using endoscopic loops and clips."}
{"answers": "Brachial systolic blood pressure difference is related to the severity of SSS and can be used as a screening tool for SSS. However, it performed better in severe steal than milder steal phenomena.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a higher blood pressure difference between arms can predict the severity of subclavian steal syndrome (SSS). In this study, patients with complete reversal or alternating flow in the vertebral artery waveform had higher blood pressure differences between arms compared to those with systolic deceleration waveform. This suggests that the degree of blood pressure difference between arms may be a useful marker for predicting the severity of SSS."}
{"answers": "a-tDCS could be useful in identifying residual connectivity markers in clinically-defined UWS, who may lack of purposeful behavior as a result of a motor-output failure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can be useful in differentiating unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) from minimally conscious state (MCS) patients. The study found that a-tDCS can boost cortical connectivity and excitability in all healthy individuals, MCS, and even unmask excitability/connectivity in some UWS patients. This suggests that tDCS may be able to differentiate between these two states by revealing residual neural activity in UWS patients that is not present in MCS patients."}
{"answers": "Most people in France are influenced by situational factors when deciding if a physician should breach confidentiality to protect the spouse of a patient infected with STD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that lay people and health professionals in France generally find it acceptable to breach confidentiality to protect the wife of a patient with a sexually transmitted disease. The study found that the patient's intentions to protect his wife and to inform her of the disease had the greatest impact on acceptability, and that lay people and psychologists were more likely to find breaching confidentiality acceptable than physicians."}
{"answers": "Most students do not encounter all 10 conditions during patient encounters throughout a 4-week EM rotation, although most have exposure to at least eight. Certain conditions are far less likely than others to be encountered, and may need to be taught in a nonclinical setting.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that the majority of medical students (76.9%) saw at least eight of the ten core emergent conditions identified by the Clerkship Directors in Emergency Medicine (CDEM) National Curriculum Task Force during their 4-week Emergency Medicine (EM) clerkship."}
{"answers": "The findings indicate that the clinical significance of symptomatic BDS is similar to that of CBD stones. Bile duct sludge seems to be an early stage of choledocholithiasis.", "prediction_text": "Bile duct sludge (BDS) is less common in patients than common bile duct stones (CBD stones), and its clinical significance is poorly defined. However, this study found that BDS was more common in females and was associated with a lower frequency of common bile duct dilation after endoscopic clearance. Additionally, there was no significant difference in the recurrence of CBD stones between the BDS and CBD stone groups after endoscopic therapy. Therefore, BDS may have a different clinical significance than CBD stones."}
{"answers": "Routine placement of nasogastric tube in patients operated of LSG seems not useful in reducing leaks' incidence.", "prediction_text": "Yes, nasogastric decompression is useful in preventing staple line leaks after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. The study found that the incidence of staple line leaks was significantly lower in the group that underwent nasogastric decompression during the procedure."}
{"answers": "The results obtained in this study demonstrate that LUS is an accurate and highly sensitive procedure in staging colorectal cancer, providing a useful and reliable diagnostic tool complementary to laparoscopy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, laparoscopic sonography (LUS) is a reliable and sensitive procedure for staging colorectal cancer, particularly for evaluating hepatic metastases, with a sensitivity of 100% compared to preoperative diagnostic means and laparoscopy. However, it has a low specificity (53%) for nodal metastases."}
{"answers": "Most community providers believe IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion; this belief is associated with increased resource use. Experts comply more closely with guidelines to diagnose IBS with minimal testing. This disconnect suggests that better implementation of guidelines is warranted to minimize variation and improve cost-effectiveness of care.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, experts in IBS are less likely to consider IBS as a diagnosis of exclusion compared to non-experts."}
{"answers": "Correlation between level of radiographic transition zone on contrast enema and length of aganglionosis remains low. Systematic preoperative biopsy by coelioscopy or ombilical incision is mandatory.", "prediction_text": "The correlation between the radiographic transition zone on contrast enema and the level of aganglionosis on the specimen in Hirschsprung's disease is moderate, with an agreement of 58.1% and a kappa coefficient of 0.39."}
{"answers": "The presence of a high signal intensity change on T2-weighted MRI and the pyramidal tract sign can be used as prognostic factors for patients with CSA.", "prediction_text": "Yes, signs of spinal cord involvement, such as the presence of T2 high signal intensity areas (T2 HIA) on MRI, are associated with a poorer neurological recovery in patients with cervical spondylotic amyotrophy (CSA). The number of T2 HIA on MRI and conversion to surgery also have a significant impact on the recovery of muscle strength in patients who require surgical treatment. The presence of the pyramidal tract sign is also associated with a poorer recovery at the final follow-up after surgery."}
{"answers": "We conclude that not all low-tone sudden deafness (SD) patients suffered from endolymphatic hydrops even if they had vertigo attack at the onset and that electrocochleography (ECochG) was a useful prognostic tool.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that low-tone sudden deafness does not inevitably progress to Meniere's disease. While there is a higher risk of recurrent hearing loss in patients with low-tone SD, the progression to Meniere's disease is not significantly different between the low-tone and high-tone SD groups."}
{"answers": "It is concluded that ACE-DD genotype may be a risk factor for the causation and development of chronic kidney failure among hypertensive patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that ACE-1 gene polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) among hypertensive patients. The DD genotype of the ACE gene was found to be associated with higher levels of blood urea and serum creatinine, and the D allele was also found to be a risk factor for CKD among hypertensive patients."}
{"answers": "Older people with a history of amblyopia who develop visual loss in the previously normal eye can experience recovery of visual function in the amblyopic eye over a period of time. This recovery in visual function occurs in the wake of visual loss in the fellow eye and the improvement appears to be sustained.", "prediction_text": "No, the visual loss in amblyopic eyes is not permanent. The study found that in 9 out of 12 cases of improvement in visual acuity, the eye with amblyopia showed a mean improvement of 3.3 lines in distance and 1.9 lines in near acuity over a period of 12 months, indicating that visual loss in amblyopia can be improved with treatment."}
{"answers": "These results suggest that quantitative real-time PCR assays for BCRABL detection can be comparable between laboratories despite significant differences in methodologies if the same positive control cell line and quality control gene are used. It is imperative that some level of assay standardization be adopted between laboratories, not only for patients who are monitored at different facilities, but also for larger investigative studies in which hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular responses are to be compared.", "prediction_text": "Yes, correlated results are possible between homebrew assays for BCRABL transcript detection by quantitative real-time PCR. In this study, a strong correlation (r(s) = 0.9435, p < 0.00001) was observed between the results obtained using different methods and reagents at two different laboratories."}
{"answers": "Although the exact mechanism of SSDH in this case is unclear, we speculate that this SSDH was a hematoma that migrated from the intracranial subdural space. Low CSF pressure because of continuous drainage and intrathecal thrombolytic therapy may have played an important role in the migration of the hematoma through the spinal canal. It is important to recognize the SSDH as a possible complication of the SAH accompanied with intracranial subdural hematoma.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the case report suggests that spinal subdural hematoma can be a sequela of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm, specifically a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The patient in the report developed a subdural hematoma in the lumbosacral region after undergoing a craniotomy for a ruptured internal carotid aneurysm, despite prophylactic treatments for vasospasm. The hematoma resolved gradually over time without any neurological deficit."}
{"answers": "LAA occlusion device resulted in a slightly movement in QRS axis, reduced HR and increased the mean-mean QT interval duration. In addition, LA diameter and ARD seemed to be larger after device implantation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, LAA occlusion device altered the echocardiography and electrocardiogram parameters in patients with atrial fibrillation. After LAA occlusion, a slight and measureable movement of QRS electric axis was observed, and significant differences were observed in heart rate and the mean-mean QT interval between pre- and post-operation for all patients. However, there were no significant differences in echocardiographic parameters between before and after device implantation."}
{"answers": "The study results suggested that spinal cord untethering may be unnecessary in patients with MM who are undergoing scoliosis corrective surgery and do not present with clinical symptoms of a tethered cord, even though tethering is radiographically demonstrated.", "prediction_text": "Based on the study, untethering is not necessary prior to scoliosis correction in patients with myelomeningocele. The study found that no patient experienced neurological complications such as new cranial nerve palsy, shunt malfunction, change in urological function, or upper extremity weakness/sensory loss after undergoing scoliosis correction without untethering. However, it is important to note that this study had a small sample size and a limited follow-up period, and further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Under the conditions of this study, pulpotomy offered a viable alternative to root canal treatment for teeth with vital pulps in the short term. However, there is insufficient clinical evidence to consider this technique for the treatment of every permanent tooth. Nevertheless, it should be considered as a potential alternative approach to be further developed for future applications.", "prediction_text": "Based on the study, pulpotomy with ProRoot MTA\u00ae can be considered a permanent treatment for vital pulps in premolar or molar teeth, with an estimated survival rate of 82% at 24 months without any complementary treatment. However, two teeth required root canal treatment for pain control and one for prosthetic reasons, indicating that the treatment may not be 100% effective. Therefore, pulpotomy should not be seen as a permanent treatment, but rather as a temporary measure that may require additional treatment in the future."}
{"answers": "The site of access in our study does not appear to influence complications specifically neural injury or recurrence rates.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no significant difference in early outcomes between patients in whom access was gained above or below the mid-calf level during endovenous laser ablation for small saphenous varicose veins."}
{"answers": "Retinal haemorrhages following a convulsive episode are rare. Such a finding should trigger an extensive search for other reasons, including child abuse.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a retinal hemorrhage after a convulsion should prompt further investigation to rule out systemic disorders or child abuse."}
{"answers": "Clear and distinct differences between the two studied groups were found indicating the root of this increased confidence may have developed due to exposure to the Pathway program.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the Global Longitudinal Pathway (GLP) medical education curriculum has influenced medical students' skills and attitudes toward culturally diverse populations. A statistically significant difference was found in students' confidence ratings at the end of Years 2, 3, and 4, and qualitative results also showed similar findings."}
{"answers": "In normal daily practice, only a small number of clinically important adenomas are missed. The problem of missed adenomas probably is being exaggerated.", "prediction_text": "Based on the study, it appears that a small percentage of colorectal cancers (1.3%) may be due to missed adenomas during previous endoscopies."}
{"answers": "Emotional prosody, therefore, seems to be partially processed outside the focus of spatial attention. Whereas at early sensory processing stages spatial attention modulates the degree of emotional voice processing as a function of emotional valence, emotional prosody is processed outside of the focus of spatial attention at later processing stages.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the processing of affective prosody is influenced by spatial attention. The study found that the processing of emotional prosody differed as a function of spatial attention, with effects of emotional prosody interacting with effects of spatial attention at early processing levels, but becoming additive at later processing stages."}
{"answers": "Pancreas retransplantation is a safe procedure with acceptable graft survival that should be proposed to diabetic patients who have lost their primary graft.", "prediction_text": "Yes, pancreas retransplantation can be a successful option for diabetic patients who have lost their primary graft, with similar survival rates to primary graft survival and better survival than their first pancreas transplantation."}
{"answers": "Weekend hospitalization leads to delayed provision of intensive procedures and elevated 1-year mortality for elderly AMI patients. The existence of measurable differences in treatments raises questions regarding the efficacy of a single input regulation (e.g., mandated nurse staffing ratios) in enhancing the quality of weekend care. My results suggest that targeted financial incentives might be a more cost-effective policy response than broad regulation aimed at improving quality.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study finds that hospitals provide lower quality care on weekends. Weekend-admitted patients are less likely to receive immediate intensive cardiac procedures, such as catheterization, angioplasty, and bypass surgery, and experience higher rates of adverse health outcomes, including higher mortality and readmission rates for congestive heart failure, compared to weekday-admitted patients. The primary effect is delayed treatment, as weekend-weekday procedure differentials narrow over time from the initial hospitalization."}
{"answers": "The presence of more than one virus in hospitalized children with ARI is very frequent but it does not seem to have a major clinical impact in terms of severity. However bacterial superinfection increases the severity of the disease course. On the contrary, pneumococcal vaccination plays a protective role.", "prediction_text": "No, the presence of multiple viruses in children with acute respiratory infection (ARI) does not significantly correlate with the severity of the infection. However, bacterial superinfection is associated with increased severity, and pneumococcal vaccination is found to be a protective factor in terms of respiratory distress, PICU admission, clinical score, respiratory support requirement, and oxygen necessity."}
{"answers": "In our study, it was observed that although longer ETA was associated with longer hospitalization, ETA was not correlated with postoperative complications. Our results inclined toward the position that appendectomy can be performed as a semielective surgery.", "prediction_text": "Delaying appendectomy beyond 8 hours was not found to be a significant predictor of increased complications in this study. In fact, patients who underwent surgery within 8 hours had a significantly shorter hospital stay compared to those who had a longer ETA."}
{"answers": "Fetal gender does not affect the risk of having an ED visit for asthma during pregnancy, and it is not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes among women who had an asthma-related ED during pregnancy.", "prediction_text": "No, fetal gender was not associated with emergency department visits for asthma during pregnancy in this study. The odds ratio for fetal gender was 1.01 (95% CI 0.85-1.19), indicating that the risk of an ED visit for asthma was similar for both male and female fetuses."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that working exposure increases the risk or leads to the clinical manifestation of rotator cuff tears. Although a detailed analysis of individual physical exposure is not available yet, the statistical results indicate that rotator cuff tears must be taken into consideration as a result of ergonomic exposure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that rotator cuff tears are more common among males working in certain occupations, particularly those in agriculture and forestry, and the building industry."}
{"answers": "High-quality training, strict compliance with evidence-based guidelines, and thorough documentation is associated with significant reductions in CLABSIs. Mindful organizing may lead to a better understanding of what goes into a unit's ability to handle peak demands and sustain extraordinary performance in the long-term.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the zero central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) rate achieved in the NICU of the Floating Hospital for Children at Tufts Medical Center was found to be sustainable for at least 1 year. The study showed that ongoing training, surveillance, and vigilance with catheter insertion and maintenance practices, as well as improved documentation, were key drivers of success in maintaining the low CLABSI rate."}
{"answers": "Ketamine sedation was successful and well tolerated in all cases. The use of atropine as an adjunct for intramuscular ketamine sedation in children significantly reduces hypersalivation and may lower the incidence of post-procedural vomiting. Atropine is associated with a higher incidence of a transient rash. No serious adverse events were noted.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that atropine is not needed with ketamine sedation in children, as atropine did not provide any additional benefit in reducing hypersalivation or side effects compared to placebo. In fact, atropine was associated with a higher risk of transient rash. The study suggests that placebo may be a sufficient adjunct to ketamine sedation in children."}
{"answers": "Findings depict wandering and PNA as overlapping, but nonequivalent phenomena. Evidence supporting construct validity of wandering was more robust than that for PNA. Results have implications for accuracy in scientific and clinical detection and labeling of wandering and agitation.", "prediction_text": "No, wandering and physically nonaggressive agitation (PNA) are not equivalent concepts. While there is a significant correlation between wandering and PNA, they are distinct phenomena, as evidenced by the different factor structures revealed through factor analysis."}
{"answers": "An advance care planning model is feasible for community palliative care services. Quality audit processes are an essential component of the Model with documentation of advance care planning discussion established as an important outcome measure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that an advance care planning model is feasible in community palliative care settings. The model was successfully embedded in the organizational structures of three community palliative care services in Victoria, Australia, and resulted in increased advance care planning conversations and involvement of family."}
{"answers": "The study allows us to determine that FB can move through the body but not towards the heart. The study also serves as a warning sign: in cases of prolonged histories of FB ingestion, imaging studies are mandatory before endoscopic examination.", "prediction_text": "Yes, foreign bodies (FB) can migrate through the body towards the heart, a phenomenon known as \"FB walk to the heart.\" This can occur through various mechanisms, including the movement of FB through the mucosa, the bloodstream, and the lymphatic system. The study discussed in the medical paper analyzed four cases of extra-lumen migration of FB and described the mechanisms and risks involved in FB migration, as well as the methods for diagnosing it."}
{"answers": "Although most players in the study believe that rugby headgear may prevent concussion, only a minority reported wearing it. Coaches tended to be less convinced than the players that rugby headgear can prevent concussion.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, the players believed that the headgear could prevent concussion, but the coaches were less convinced. Only a minority of players reported wearing headgear and few felt that its use should be made mandatory."}
{"answers": "Early oral intake is possible after laparotomy and colorectal resection. Thus, the laparoscopic surgeon's claim of early tolerated oral intake may not be unique to laparoscopy.", "prediction_text": "No, early postoperative oral intake does not have to be limited to laparoscopy. The study found that patients who underwent laparotomy (an open surgical procedure) were able to resume regular food intake after resolution of ileus, which occurred at a similar rate as in the laparoscopy group."}
{"answers": "Both medial and lateral PTS were significantly steeper in failures of ACLR than the control group. Medial or lateral PTS \u22655\u00b0 was a new risk factor of ACLR failure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that failures of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) are associated with steep posterior tibial slopes (PTS). Specifically, the medial and lateral PTS were significantly steeper in the ACLR failure group compared to the control group. The odds ratio of ACLR failure for medial PTS \u2265 5\u00b0 was 6.8, and for lateral PTS \u2265 5\u00b0 was 10.8. These findings suggest that assessing PTS may be a useful tool in predicting the risk of ACLR failure."}
{"answers": "These results suggest the need to provide interventions that are specifically designed to increase awareness of potential stroke signs and symptoms and appropriate subsequent clinical actions.", "prediction_text": "Only 14% of elderly patients correctly endorsed their intention to call 911 when presented with signs and symptoms of acute stroke, using a standardized questionnaire. Lower levels of education were associated with correctly endorsing the intention to call 911, with those with higher levels of education being more likely to do so."}
{"answers": "We conclude that routine CXR after bronchoscopy with TBB is necessary only in patients with symptoms suggestive of pneumothorax. In asymptomatic patients, pneumothorax is rare and usually small, so routine CXR is not necessary in this category of patients.", "prediction_text": "No, routine chest radiography after transbronchial biopsy is not necessary, as pneumothorax occurs in only 2.9% of cases and symptoms suggestive of pneumothorax are present in only 7% of cases."}
{"answers": "Early surfactant administration is associated with shorter duration of ventilation but does not appear to be significantly protective against CLD/mortality among premature infants. This may support the growing evidence for consideration of CPAP as an alternative to routine intubation and early surfactant administration. Further investigation from large randomized clinical trials is warranted to confirm these results.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the timing of initial surfactant treatment makes a significant difference in the rates of chronic lung disease (CLD) and mortality in premature infants. The study found that infants who received early surfactant (within one hour of birth) had lower rates of CLD and mortality compared to those who received late surfactant (after one hour of birth)."}
{"answers": "The study supports the hypothesis that nurses' aides who were exposed to ETS at home during childhood have an increased risk of long-term sickness absence.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that nurses' aides who were exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) at home during childhood had an increased risk of long-term sick leave, particularly for neck and back pain, and any illness. The risk was found to be higher for those who were exposed to ETS for a longer duration and for those who had a family history of smoking."}
{"answers": "We concluded that depiction of the superior wall of the mandibular canal cannot be improved by changing the thickness of images.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mandibular depiction can be improved by changing the thickness of double-oblique computed tomography images. The study found that the highest value for mandibular depiction was obtained with 0.9 mm-thick images in the alveolar crest and the whole of the mandibular canal."}
{"answers": "Exclusive CRT approach is not safe to treat patients with low infiltrative rectal carcinoma.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that chemoradiation therapy (CRT) may not be a safe option for treating mid and low rectal tumors, as the majority of patients who achieved a complete response (CR) after CRT experienced local recurrence within a short period of time. The study found that among the 10 patients who achieved CR, 8 experienced local recurrence within 3.7 to 8.8 months. Additionally, the study found that overall survival was negatively affected by lymph node metastases and perineural invasion. Therefore, it can be concluded that CRT may not be a safe option for treating mid and low rectal tumors."}
{"answers": "Random survival forests did not yield higher performance compared to Cox proportional hazards. We found improvement in prediction performance when coupling the genetic SNP score with clinical/demographic markers, which warrants further investigation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, multiple SNP testing in BRCA2 and BRCA1 female carriers can be used to improve risk prediction models in conjunction with clinical assessment. The study found that including both a genetic SNP score and clinical/demographic variables in multivariable Cox proportional hazards models or random survival forests improved the predictive ability of risk models for BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers, with average concordance index values of 0.221 and 0.215, respectively."}
{"answers": "Bedtime NPH insulin added to maximal therapy with sulfonylurea and metformin is an effective, simple, well-tolerated approach for patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, continuing oral hypoglycemic agents in addition to starting insulin therapy may be a better approach than starting insulin monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes. The study found that the insulin combination group (IC group) had better outcomes in terms of treatment failure, weight gain, and hypoglycemic events compared to the insulin monotherapy group (IM group). However, the difference in HbA1c reduction between the two groups was not statistically significant. Therefore, the study suggests that continuing oral hypoglycemic agents in addition to starting insulin therapy may be a more effective and safer approach"}
{"answers": "PET data show that amoxapine's profile is very similar to that of the established atypical antipsychotics. These data, together with amoxapine's in vitro pharmacologic profile, effectiveness in animal models, and efficacy in psychotic depression raise the possibility of amoxapine as an \"atypical\" antipsychotic agent in the treatment of schizophrenia.", "prediction_text": "Yes, amoxapine is an atypical antipsychotic, as it meets the criteria mentioned in the medical paper:"}
{"answers": "In gravid ewes, intravenous infusion of<or = 1.67 micrograms/min epinephrine altered neither maternal hemodynamics nor uterine blood flow. To the extent that sheep data can be extrapolated to humans, these results suggest that continuous intravenous infusion of epinephrine in local anesthetic solutions is safe if the epidural catheter should enter a blood vessel during the infusion.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a continuous intravenous infusion of low-concentration epinephrine (0.125% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 or 1:400,000 epinephrine) impaired uterine blood flow in pregnant ewes, decreasing it to 68 +/- 14% of baseline."}
{"answers": "These data indicate that major blunt trauma enhances the migratory capacity of circulating neutrophils. This is manifest within 2 hrs of admission and may be attributable to alteration in interleukin-8 receptor expression, affinity, or downstream signaling. In patients who later develop ARDS, initially elevated circulating neutrophil counts decrease rapidly, over the same time course. Early enhanced neutrophil migratory activity coupled with elevated pulmonary concentrations of interleukin-8 may be central to the establishment of the neutrophil infiltration that is characteristic of ARDS.", "prediction_text": "Yes, increased neutrophil migratory activity after major trauma may play a crucial factor in the etiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The study found that neutrophils isolated from major trauma patients exhibited an enhanced migratory response to high concentrations of interleukin-8 throughout the first 24 hours of admission, in contrast to the normal physiologic attenuation of migration seen in neutrophils isolated from normal laboratory volunteers. This suggests that the early post-injury inflammatory response may play a key role in the development of ARDS."}
{"answers": "Memory provocation increased the sensitivity of rCBF-SPECT for the detection of AD-related blood flow changes in the brain at the group level. Further studies are needed to evaluate MP-SPECT as a diagnostic tool at the individual level. If a higher sensitivity for AD at the individual level is verified in future studies, a single MP-SPECT study might be sufficient in the clinical setting.", "prediction_text": "The study found that memory-provoked rCBF-SPECT (MP-SPECT) can increase the diagnostic sensitivity of rCBF SPECT in differentiating between Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and normal controls, with a significant reduction in left parietal cortex rCBF observed in AD patients compared to healthy elderly during a memory provocation task."}
{"answers": "1. DBE is a safe and and accurate method to diagnose small bowel disorders; 2. this method permits chromoscopy, biopsies and treatment of the lesions.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) is an accurate method for diagnosing small-bowel disorders, with a diagnostic yield of 75% and a therapeutic yield of 63.6%. The study found that DBE was able to identify the source of bleeding in 75% of patients with occult or obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, and diagnose other small-bowel disorders such as duodenal adenocarcinoma, jejunal tuberculosis, and lymphangiectasia due to blastomycosis. The study also found that DBE was safe, with no"}
{"answers": "Reorganization of care to offer a primary angioplasty service was acceptable to patients and their carers. Satisfaction levels were high regardless of the type of care received, with the exception of discharge and aftercare.", "prediction_text": "Yes, primary angioplasty is an acceptable alternative to thrombolysis for patients experiencing acute myocardial infarction. The study found that patients who received primary angioplasty were more satisfied with the speed of treatment and overall care compared to those who received thrombolysis. However, carers of patients who received primary angioplasty reported lower convenience of visiting the hospital compared to the control group. Despite this, the majority of patients and carers accepted the added inconvenience of visiting the primary angioplasty site in the context of life-saving treatment."}
{"answers": "The leukocyte count at presentation can be used as an adjunct in the evaluation of the severity of injury in blunt trauma patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the leukocyte count at presentation correlates positively with the severity of injury, as measured by the Injury Severity Score (ISS), but negatively with the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and Revised Trauma Score (RTS)."}
{"answers": "Right ventricular recovery following PVR for chronic significant pulmonary regurgitation after repair of TOF may be compromised in the adult population. In order to maintain adequate RV contractility, pulmonary valve implant in these patients should be considered before RV function deteriorates.", "prediction_text": "No, the study suggests that pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) is not performed too late in adults late after repair of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). The study found that right ventricular volume and function remained unchanged after PVR, and the rate of maintaining a normal right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) was higher in patients with pre-operative RVEF > or = 0.40. These findings suggest that PVR can be safely performed in adults with significant pulmonary regurgitation late after TOF repair, and that timing of surgery may not be critical for optimal outcomes."}
{"answers": "Combined approach tympanoplasty (CAT) allows for successful treatment of cholesteatoma with rates of recurrent and residual disease comparable to open mastoid surgery. Early timing of second-look procedures allows easier removal of any recurrent or residual disease, which reduces the conversion rate to open mastoidectomy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, early second-look tympanoplasty can reduce the rate of conversion to modified radical mastoidectomy. In this study, the rate of conversion was 3% among patients who underwent early second-look surgery, compared to 10.6% among those who did not undergo early second-look surgery."}
{"answers": "In 1995, the first year that the MQSA was in effect, there was a significant improvement in the quality of mammography in North Carolina. This improvement probably resulted from facilities' compliance with federal regulations.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the implementation of the MQSA in 1992 had a significant positive impact on the quality of mammography in North Carolina, as evidenced by the improvement in the percentage of facilities meeting quality standards and the passing rates for phantom image evaluation, darkroom fog, and developer temperature."}
{"answers": "HIE was associated with reduced repeat imaging in EDs. This study is among the first to find empirical support for this anticipated benefit of HIE.", "prediction_text": "Yes, health information exchange (HIE) was associated with a reduction in the probability of repeat imaging in emergency departments (EDs) for all three modalities studied (computed tomography, ultrasound, and chest x-ray). The reduction in repeat imaging ranged from 44% to 67% relative to the sample means."}
{"answers": "Gestational age misclassification is an unlikely explanation for the reported divergence in average birth-weights for Aborigines and whites. The results might help with the interpretation of other between-population comparisons.", "prediction_text": "No, gestational age misclassification does not explain the difference in birthweights for Australian Aborigines and whites. The study found that while the reported gestational age data can affect the estimated birthweight distributions, extreme types of misclassification are required to remove the divergence in median birthweights for the two groups."}
{"answers": "W-d HCCs were clinically demonstrated not to be early cancer, because there was no significant difference in disease free survival between the patients with w-d and l-d HCCs.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that well-differentiated small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may not be clinically early cancer, as there were no significant differences in the incidence of intrahepatic metastasis or portal vein invasion between the well-differentiated and less differentiated HCCs. However, the study did find that well-differentiated HCCs had lower incidences of fibrous capsule formation, which may be a prognostic factor. The study also found that minute cancerous foci may have been present at the time of operation, suggesting that the disease may be more aggressive than previously thought. Therefore, the prognosis"}
{"answers": "The incidence of post-tonsillectomy late haemorrhage in our study population was 1.78%. A statistically significant difference was found between night-time and day-time haemorrhages. Even though no significant distribution of haemorrhages per hour was observed, we underline that we recorded 32 (54.2%) events in 2 periods of the day: from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. and from 6 to 9 a.m.", "prediction_text": "Yes, according to the study, post-tonsillectomy late haemorrhage is more likely to occur at night-time (71.2%) than during the day-time (28.8%)."}
{"answers": "Biased estimates of asthma severity may contribute to racially disparate asthma care. Interventions to improve physicians' assessments of asthma severity and patient-physician communication may minimize racial disparities in asthma care.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that physician estimates of asthma severity were less accurate in black than in white patients. Black patients were more likely to have their asthma severity underestimated by their physicians, with a odds ratio of 1.39 (95% CI 1.08-1.79)."}
{"answers": "Many factors contribute to the erroneous reporting of hCG results, including (a) the complexity of hCG molecule and confusion of nomenclature on the various forms of hCG; (b) laboratory personnel's lack of awareness of the distinctions of the forms of hCG and failure to recognize the specificity of assays for their measurement; (c) lack of clarity and uniformity in manufacturers' reagent labeling; and (d) most product inserts' lack of information on the specificity of each method to the various forms of hCG.", "prediction_text": "No, laboratories are not reporting serum quantitative hCG results correctly. The study found errors in the reporting of intact hCG results as total beta hCG (9.3%) and total beta hCG as intact hCG (13.1%)."}

{"answers": "These data suggest that either apoptosis is not involved in cell loss in MTS, or a very slow rate of cell demise may have precluded detecting TUNEL-positive neurons dying through apoptosis. Increased Bax expression and activation of caspases support the latter possibility.", "prediction_text": "The study found that there was no evidence of DNA fragmentation by TUNEL staining or typical apoptotic changes in nuclear morphology in the temporal lobe specimens from patients with mesial temporal sclerosis, suggesting that the cell death in this condition is not primarily apoptotic."}
{"answers": "Golytely was more efficacious than MiraLAX in bowel cleansing, and was independently associated with both bowel prep quality (BBPS \u2265 7) and higher adenoma detection. Golytely should be used as first line for bowel prep for colonoscopy. Studies with larger populations are needed to confirm these results.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant difference in the adenoma detection rate between MiraLAX and Golytely. Golytely was found to be associated with a higher adenoma detection rate than MiraLAX, with a relative risk of 2.28 (95% CI 1.05-4.98, P = 0.04) in multivariate analysis."}
{"answers": "Patient's age (>60 y) and large polyp size (>10 mm) were significant predictive factors for neoplastic GB polyps. GB polyps less than 10 mm in diameter do not require surgical intervention simply because they grow.", "prediction_text": "No, the growth rate of a gallbladder polyp cannot predict a neoplastic polyp. According to the study, older age and larger size of the polyp are significantly associated with neoplastic polyps, but the growth rate is not."}
{"answers": "These data suggest that the R14C KCNQ1 mutation alone is insufficient to cause AF. Rather, we suggest a model in which a \"second hit\", such as an environmental factor like hypertension, which promotes atrial stretch and thereby unmasks an inherited defect in ion channel kinetics (the \"first hit\"), is required for AF to be manifested. Such a model would also account for the age-related increase in AF development.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found a stretch-sensitive KCNQ1 mutation (R14C) that was associated with atrial fibrillation in older individuals with atrial dilation, suggesting a link between genetic and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation. The mutation led to altered channel kinetics and a leftward shift in the voltage dependence of activation, which may contribute to the development of atrial fibrillation in response to stretch."}
{"answers": "The real-time PCR approach revealed promising results in pollen identification and quantification, even when analyzing pollen mixes. Future perspectives could concern the development of multiplex real-time PCR for the simultaneous detection of different taxa in the same reaction tube and the application of high-throughput molecular methods.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach can be a rapid, accurate, and automated tool for the detection and quantification of airborne allergenic pollen taxa, offering a new perspective for aerobiological monitoring."}
{"answers": "The Ambu SIB was able to accurately deliver targeted pressures across all three models from preterm to infant. The Neopuff infant resuscitator was unable to deliver the targeted pressures in the infant model developing clinically significant levels of inadvertent PEEP which may pose risk during infant resuscitation.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the Ambu self-inflating bag (SIB) provided more accurate and safe manual inflations compared to the Neopuff T-piece resuscitator, particularly in the infant model. The Neopuff was unable to reach set peak inflation pressures and exhibited elevated positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) in this model, while the Ambu SIB accurately delivered targeted pressures in all three models. Therefore, the Ambu SIB may be a better option for manual resuscitation of infants up to 10\u2005kg weight."}
{"answers": "This longitudinal study found no significant effect of menopausal transition on quality of life among Taiwanese women. The decline in the role limitations due to emotional problems was related to vasomotor symptoms.", "prediction_text": "No, the menopausal transition itself does not significantly affect the quality of life in middle-aged women in Kinmen, according to the study. However, vasomotor symptoms, such as hot flashes, were found to have a negative impact on role limitation due to emotional problems after adjusting for other factors."}
{"answers": "The incidence of CPM is not increased in IVF/ICSI pregnancies compared with spontaneous conceptions. CPM probably does not account for the adverse perinatal outcomes following IVF/ICSI.", "prediction_text": "No, confined placental mosaicism does not account for adverse perinatal outcomes in IVF pregnancies. The incidence of confined placental mosaicism was lower in IVF/ICSI pregnancies compared to spontaneous conceptions, and the incidence of fetal chromosomal anomalies was increased in IVF/ICSI pregnancies, but these differences were not statistically significant."}
{"answers": "For risk stratification in emergency surgical patients, it is essential to measure the APACHE II score before surgical treatment. Longitudinal APACHE II scoring reveals continuous improvement of the score in surviving patients but has no therapeutic relevance in the individual patient.", "prediction_text": "The APACHE II score is not an independent marker of physiological impairment in emergency surgical patients, as it is influenced by the effects of treatment and might lead to bias in the comparison of defined groups of patients and the evaluation of treatment policies. The score is also clinically irrelevant for postoperative monitoring."}
{"answers": "The methodologic weaknesses of the studies do not permit acceptance of increased risk of tubal pregnancy or infertility as a consequence of perforation of the appendix, so a causal relationship cannot be supported by the data currently available. Only a well-designed case-control study with unbiased ascertainment of exposure and adjustment for confounding variables will provide a definitive answer.", "prediction_text": "The evidence suggests that perforation of the appendix may be associated with an increased risk of tubal infertility and ectopic pregnancy, although the estimates of risk vary widely across studies and are affected by limitations in study design and reporting."}
{"answers": "Cancellous bone plays an important role in primary stability of mini-implants in the presence or absence of cortical bone.", "prediction_text": "Yes, trabecular bone is related to the primary stability of miniscrews. Lower levels of primary stability were observed when the bone mineral density (BMD) of trabecular bone was lower and when cortical bone was absent. Trabecular number, thickness, bone volume density, and total BMD were found to be correlated with primary stability."}
{"answers": "Despite recent efforts, a large proportion of newly confirmed TB patients could not adhere to standard TB treatment, and patients' lost to follow-up was still a serious problem. Poor treatment supervision and heavy financial burden might be the main causes for non-adherence. More needs to be done to enhance treatment supervision policies and financial supports to both health providers and TB patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that a significant proportion of TB patients in China (36.0%) were non-adherent to their prescribed treatments, and the loss to follow-up was high (28.2%). Factors that increased the likelihood of non-adherence included being observed by family members and paying monthly service expenses above 450 RMB, while supervision by home visit and phone calls were protective factors."}
{"answers": "While not providing conclusive evidence, this single institution experience suggests that neoadjuvant chemotherapy for Stage IV NPC patients improves both survival and disease control. Recurrence within the irradiated volume was the most prevalent mode of failure and future studies will evaluate regimens to enhance local regional control.", "prediction_text": "Yes, induction chemotherapy has a significant role in the management of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The study found that patients who received induction chemotherapy had better overall survival, freedom from relapse, and local control compared to those who did not receive chemotherapy. The benefit of induction chemotherapy was particularly evident in patients with poorly differentiated carcinoma, NOS (UNPC), who had a 5-year distant failure rate of 13% when treated with chemotherapy and controlled in the primary and neck. In contrast, patients who did not receive chemotherapy had a higher distant failure rate. The study suggests that induction chemotherapy should be considered as a"}
{"answers": "There was increased expression of TGF-\u03b21 and VEGF in polyps compared to adjacent normal endometrial tissue. It suggested that these cytokines might play a role in endometrial polyp formation. In addition, there was a significant correlation between steroid receptor expression and VEGF and TGF-\u03b21 expression.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that endometrial polyp formation is associated with increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-\u03b21) in the glandular and stromal cells of endometrial polyps. Specifically, the expression of VEGF was significantly higher in glandular cells and TGF-\u03b21 was significantly higher in both glandular and stromal cells of endometrial polyps compared to adjacent endometrial tissue. Additionally, there was a significant correlation between the expression of steroid receptors (estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor) and VEGF and"}
{"answers": "Primary eosinophilic esophagitis is characterized by fragile esophageal mucosa that readily tears in response to minor trauma during otherwise uneventful diagnostic endoscopy. This \"cr\u00eape-paper\" sign may alert endoscopists to the presence of the disease when other mucosal alterations are lacking. Dilation is effective for patients with symptoms with minimal morbidity, despite development of disquieting lesions in response to the procedure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the fragility of the esophageal mucosa is a pathognomonic endoscopic sign of primary eosinophilic esophagitis."}
{"answers": "Preoperative platelet count is a predictive factor for long-term survival in ESCC, especially in nodal-positive patients. We conclude that 205 (\u00d710(9)/L) may be the optimum cutoff point for platelet count in predicting survival in ESCC patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, preoperative platelet count is a prognostic factor in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The study found that patients with a preoperative platelet count \u2264 205 had a significantly better 5-year survival than patients with a platelet count > 205. Additionally, multivariate analysis showed that platelet count, T grade, and N staging were independent prognostic factors."}
{"answers": "From this study we conclude that there is no increase in testicular atrophy in patients less than 13 months.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the age at which orchiopexy is performed affects the survival of the testis. Testicular atrophy was highest for orchiopexy performed between 13-24 months of age, compared to those less than 13 months or greater than 24 months."}
{"answers": "The results suggest that a longer duration of treatment may prevent return into mental health care in some groups. However, because of the design of the study, no causal inference can be drawn. Further research, preferably in a RCT, is needed to determine whether the trend towards lower intensity treatments is associated with repeated mental health care use.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the duration of psychological treatment for depression is related to the likelihood of returning into treatment. Patients who received shorter durations of treatment (5-250 minutes, 251-500 minutes, and 751-1000 minutes) were slightly more likely to return for additional treatment compared to those who received longer durations of treatment (>1000 minutes)."}
{"answers": "Written information sheets contribute to the process of informed consent. As patients' recall of information is generally poor, the sheets may also be useful medicolegally, as a permanent record of what was discussed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a written information sheet improves recall of the consent interview for total hip arthroplasty compared to verbal information alone. The patients receiving written information had a significantly higher rate of correct answers on a questionnaire completed 18 days later."}
{"answers": "Although theoretically plausible, bicompartmental knee arthroplasty was not superior in knee muscle strength and physical performance at 1 year compared with total knee arthroplasty.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that there was no significant difference in isokinetic knee muscle strength, position sense, and physical performance between patients who underwent bicompartmental knee arthroplasty and those who underwent total knee arthroplasty (TKA) at any time point, including preoperatively, 6 months, and 12 months after surgery."}
{"answers": "These results indicate that T-cell deficiency may affect spatial learning performance following toluene exposure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, T-cell deficiency can affect spatial learning ability following toluene exposure. In the study, nude mice, which have a T-cell deficiency, showed impaired spatial learning ability compared to wild-type mice after exposure to toluene at 90 ppm."}
{"answers": "Histology usually demonstrated moderate to severe inflammation when VLEM were present. VLEM may be a highly specific endoscopic feature of esophagitis in children.", "prediction_text": "Yes, VLEM is a true endoscopic manifestation of esophagitis in children, with a high specificity and sensitivity for detecting eosinophilic esophagitis."}
{"answers": "At the gas flows studied, HFNC are not noisier than BCPAP for preterm infants.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no evidence to suggest that high flow nasal cannulae (HFNC) are noisier than bubble continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for preterm infants. In fact, HFNC was found to be quieter than BCPAP at low frequencies (500 Hz)."}
{"answers": "Patients with a history of ACD are at an increased risk of having recurrent preterm birth and cervical shortening in a subsequent pregnancy compared with women with prior preterm birth associated PPROM or PTL.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the clinical presentation of a prior preterm birth (SPTB) predicts the risk of recurrent preterm birth in a subsequent pregnancy. Women with a history of advanced cervical dilatation (ACD) have a higher risk of recurrent preterm birth compared to those with a history of preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) or preterm labor (PTL)."}
{"answers": "This illustrates that Paget's disease does exist in India and a high index of suspicion is required to clinch the diagnosis.", "prediction_text": "Yes, Paget's disease exists in India, as demonstrated by the present study of 21 patients with the condition."}
{"answers": "The results of the present study show that idiopathic incidental misty mesentery appearance has a significant prevalence. Also, the high body mass index of these patients and the growing evidence of obesity-induced inflammatory changes in adipose tissue are suggestive of an association between obesity and misty mesentery appearance on CT.", "prediction_text": "The prevalence of incidentally detected idiopathic misty mesentery on multidetector computed tomography (CT) is 7%. Obesity may be a triggering cause of this condition, as 67.5% of the patients were classified as obese and 17.5% as overweight."}
{"answers": "Percutaneous ethanol injection without aspiration of ethanol-mixed fluid seems to be the preferable method of treatment of benign cystic thyroid nodules from the perspective of both the physician and the patient.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no significant advantage in aspirating the ethanol-mixed fluid during percutaneous ethanol injection for benign cystic thyroid nodules. The success rates, side effects, and complications were similar between the two groups."}
{"answers": "The present study, which is based on internationally accepted assessment tools for SLE patients, shows a significant relationship between increased disease activity and reduced physical function. This result emphasizes the importance of optimizing treatment aiming at reducing disease activity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there are significant associations between health status, disease activity, and damage in patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). Increased disease activity is associated with reduced physical function, and greater damage is associated with reduced role function due to emotional limitations."}
{"answers": "The morbidity associated with desmoid tumors has not been shown to differ, whether they arise after restorative proctocolectomy or ileorectal anastomosis.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no significant difference in the clinical course of intra-abdominal desmoid tumors between patients with restorative proctocolectomy and those with ileorectal anastomosis. The rates of complications, including surgical intervention, were similar between the two groups."}
{"answers": "These findings provide evidence for the existence of a high-IQ variant of schizophrenia that is associated with markedly fewer negative symptoms than typical schizophrenia, and lends support to the idea of a psychosis spectrum or continuum over boundaried diagnostic categories.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that there may be a clinically distinct sub-type of schizophrenia among patients with high intelligence, characterized by lower levels of negative and disorganized symptoms and better global functioning and insight."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that hearing loss caused by GM otic drops may be reduced by the inclusion of BM and benzalkonium chloride. Our finding that BM alone was associated with hearing loss suggests that the benzalkonium chloride may be the protective agent in combination otic drops.", "prediction_text": "No, the addition of betamethasone to gentamicin-containing ear drops did not reduce the cochlear toxicity of the aminoglycoside. In fact, there was a significant increase in hearing loss in the betamethasone-treated ears compared to the untreated ears."}
{"answers": "A fetal anatomic survey on follow-up sonograms may identify unanticipated fetal anomalies, especially when the indication is for fetal growth.", "prediction_text": "Yes, fetal anatomic assessment on follow-up antepartum sonograms is clinically useful in detecting unanticipated fetal anomalies, particularly for renal pyelectasis. Repeated sonography for fetal growth evaluation yields a higher incidence of unexpected fetal anomalies compared to other indications."}
{"answers": "Patients with BRAF-mutant PTC had a significantly longer PFS than BRAF wild-type when treated with TKIs. However, due to the small number of BRAF-mutant patients, further investigations are required, especially to understand the potential positive effect of BRAF mutations in RAIR TC patients while having a negative prognostic impact in RAI-sensitive PTC patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the molecular genotype of radioiodine-refractory thyroid cancers (RAIR-TCs) can provide useful information in guiding therapy. In this study, BRAF mutation was found to positively influence progression-free survival (PFS) in both the entire TKI-treated cohort and the TKI-treated papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) subtype. However, in the multivariate analysis, the PDTC histologic subtype was the only independent prognostic factor for PFS. These findings suggest that BRAF mutation status may be a useful predictive biomarker for"}
{"answers": "The frequency and topographic distribution of LNM are not modified by NACT, and clinical non-responders showed more involved LNs. A systemic and extensive lymphadenectomy should be performed in patients treated with NACT plus surgery regardless of the response to NACT.", "prediction_text": "Yes, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) can modify the extent of lymphadenectomy in cervical cancer. The incidence of lymph node metastasis was significantly decreased in the NACT-responsive group compared to the non-responsive group, and the metastatic rates for every lymph node group also declined in the NACT-responsive group except for the deep inguinal and the para-aortic lymph node groups. Additionally, deep stromal invasion and lymph vascular invasion, but not the response to NACT, were independently associated with upper LNM."}
{"answers": "A prior benign prostate biopsy may be independently associated with more favorable surgical and biochemical outcomes after prostatectomy. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings.", "prediction_text": "Yes, prior benign prostate biopsy predicts better outcome for patients treated with radical perineal prostatectomy. Patients with prior benign biopsies had more favorable pathologic features, including more organ-confined and less margin-positive disease, and lower probability of biochemical failure."}
{"answers": "This clinical trial evaluated the possible reduction in intervention-related myocardial damage that was attributable to remote postischemic conditioning.", "prediction_text": "Remote postischemic conditioning (RPIC) may have a protective effect against myocardial damage in patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for stable angina or non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome, with a reduction in the maximum increase in troponin levels in the first 24 hours. However, the effect of RPIC in diabetic patients is less clear."}
{"answers": "These results indicate that prophylactic treatment with edaravone prevents I/R-induced ovarian damage during pneumoperitoneum in an experimental rat model.", "prediction_text": "Yes, edaravone offers protection against ischemia/reperfusion-induced ovarian damage in rats. The study found that administration of different doses of edaravone significantly prevented degenerative changes in the ovary and reduced caspase-3 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, biochemical measurements of oxidative stress markers revealed that prophylactic edaravone treatment attenuated oxidative stress induced by I/R injury."}
{"answers": "Sonography has no place in the diagnosis of undescended testis.", "prediction_text": "No, ultrasonography did not detect retractile testes and missed undescended testes in 67% of cases where they were palpable. Therefore, ultrasonography is not a reliable method for evaluating undescended testes in boys."}
{"answers": "Mammographic density is not associated with an increased need for re-excision or resection of unnecessary margins at initial BCS.", "prediction_text": "No, mammographic density was not found to have an impact on the margin re-excision rate after breast-conserving surgery in this study."}
{"answers": "Septal suturing after septoplasty offers the following advantages: elimination of discomfort for the patients, minimal complications, the outcome is almost the same as with nasal packing, and finally the hospital stay is less than with nasal packing. Therefore, suturing of the nasal septum after septoplasty should be a preferred alternative to nasal packing.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that suturing the nasal septum after septoplasty is not an effective alternative to nasal packing. The study found a higher incidence of minor oozing, bleeding, and septal hematoma in the group that underwent suturing, as well as a longer operating time. Additionally, a higher percentage of patients in the suturing group developed postoperative adhesions and had remnant deviated nasal septum."}
{"answers": "The present study does not support the recommendation of ultrasound as a conclusive diagnostic tool for internal derangements of the temporomandibular joint.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that ultrasound imaging has lower sensitivity compared to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in detecting internal derangements of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Therefore, ultrasound may not be a reliable diagnostic tool for detecting TMJ internal derangements."}
{"answers": "Our results showed that the serum leptin level has no prognostic indications in advanced lung cancer patients. Leptin is decreased in lung cancer, and there is lack of correlation with tumour\u2011related factors including prognosis. Therefore, leptin is not a useful clinical marker in lung cancer (Tab. 2, Fig. 2, Ref. 22).", "prediction_text": "No, serum leptin levels were not found to be a prognostic factor for overall survival in advanced lung cancer patients."}
{"answers": "We found no evidence of serovar specific immunity in our population. It remains possible that populations with a higher prevalence of gonorrhoea and more frequent infections may have a quantitatively greater immune response.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no evidence of serovar-specific immunity to Neisseria gonorrhoeae, as the study found no significant difference in the prevalence of serovars isolated following a repeat infection compared to those without repeat infections."}
{"answers": "BPPV is associated with positive viral serology, particularly during certain months of the year, mainly in spring and autumn. Viral infection might promote BPPV attacks due to the development of vestibulopathy or induce secondary BPPV via viral infection-related neurolabyrinthitis.", "prediction_text": "Yes, viral infections are associated with an increased risk of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). The study found that the majority of viral agents tested were more prevalent in the BPPV group than in the control group, with seasonal variations in the prevalence of certain viruses. These findings suggest that viral infections may play a role in the development of BPPV."}
{"answers": "We found increased post-ictal serum cytokine levels in patients with several epilepsy syndromes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that cytokines play a role in epilepsy. The levels of certain cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6) were found to be elevated in the serum of patients with epilepsy compared to healthy controls. Additionally, there was a correlation between certain cytokine levels and various clinical parameters, such as male gender, positive family history, and duration of epilepsy. Furthermore, serial analysis during the seizure-free period revealed a decrease in cytokine levels in some patients. These findings suggest that cytokines may play a role in the pathophysiology"}
{"answers": "Neuromedin U reduces insulin and increases somatostatin secretion. Blockade of somatostatin action abolishes the inhibition of insulin secretion by NmU. The results of the study suggest that somatostatin mediates the inhibitory action of NmU on insulin secretion.", "prediction_text": "Yes, somatostatin confers insulinostatic effects of neuromedin U in the rat pancreas."}
{"answers": "Patients with fewer or anterior sutures have shorter OR times. However, 30-day readmission, band-related reoperation, and postoperative weight loss were unaffected by number or location of suture. The technical aspects of HHR did not appear to be associated with readmission or reoperation, and therefore a standardized approach may not be necessary.", "prediction_text": "The location and number of sutures used for hiatal hernia repair during laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) may have an impact on the rate of reoperation for band-related problems. Specifically, patients who had fewer sutures (on average 1 suture) had shorter operating room (OR) times, while those with posterior suture placement had longer hospital lengths of stay (LOS). There was no significant difference in other outcomes such as readmission rates, reoperation rates, and postoperative body mass index (BMI) or excess weight loss (EWL)."}
{"answers": "Survivors of lobar ICH with atrial fibrillation should not be offered long-term anticoagulation. Similarly, most patients with deep hemispheric ICH and atrial fibrillation should not receive anticoagulant therapy. However, patients with deep hemispheric ICH at particularly high risk for thromboembolic stroke or low risk of ICH recurrence might benefit from long-term anticoagulation.", "prediction_text": "The decision to anticoagulate a patient with a history of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) should be individualized based on the patient's specific characteristics and the potential risks and benefits of anticoagulation. A decision-analysis model suggests that for patients with a history of lobar ICH, withholding anticoagulation therapy may be the preferred option, improving quality-adjusted life expectancy by 1.9 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). However, for patients with a history of deep hemispheric ICH, the gain in QALYs is"}
{"answers": "This study showed that FDG is not a good surrogate tracer for tumor hypoxia under either ambient or hypoxic conditions. Only specific hypoxia tracers should be used to measure tumor hypoxia.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that (18)F-FDG is not a reliable surrogate tracer to measure tumor hypoxia, as there is a decreasing similarity between the (14)C-EF3 and FDG activity in the tumor tissue under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. The Dice similarity index (DSI) was used to evaluate the similarity between the two tracers and it was found that under hypoxic conditions, the DSI was higher for SCCVII tumors. These findings suggest that (18)F-FDG may not accurately reflect the tumor hypoxia status, and other tracers may be needed to detect hy"}
{"answers": "A task-specific intervention designed to improve gait speed may potentially provide secondary benefits by positively impacting depression, mobility and social participation for people post stroke.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there are secondary benefits of treadmill training for people in the chronic stage of recovery from stroke, including improvements in depression, mobility, and social participation."}
{"answers": "Orthostatic myoclonus is often underdiagnosed and can be considered a possible cause of unsteadiness in subjects with neurodegenerative diseases. Electromyography surface recording is thereby an aid for investigating unsteadiness of unknown origin.", "prediction_text": "Yes, orthostatic myoclonus (OM) is an underrecognized cause of unsteadiness in neurodegenerative diseases. The study found that OM was the most frequent disorder in patients with unexplained unsteadiness/gait impairment, and that 68.7% of patients with OM had an associated neurodegenerative disease. The study suggests that OM should be considered as a potential cause of unsteadiness in patients with neurodegenerative diseases, and that further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of antimyoclonic treatment for OM."}
{"answers": "Severely injured patients treated at a level III center had a higher mortality rate than those treated at a level I center. Most problems identified occurred in the emergency department and were related to delays in care provision. This research highlights the importance of efficient prehospital, in-hospital, and regional trauma systems, performance monitoring, peer review, and adherence to protocols and guidelines.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the level of trauma center providing treatment to severely injured adult trauma patients in an Australian health service makes a significant difference in terms of mortality and hospital length of stay. Specifically, patients who presented to a level III trauma center had a higher risk of death compared to those who presented to a level I trauma center, after controlling for various factors such as age, sex, Injury Severity Score (ISS), and prehospital time. Additionally, peer review of deaths at the level III center identified problems in care delivery in 15 cases, highlighting the importance of adequate resources and quality of care at higher level trauma centers."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that very few genes, which change their expression level during the WOI, show a quantitative homogeneous expression in endometrially-receptive patients. In conclusion, in this study only six genes showed a homogeneous expression, and are probably involved in embryo implantation mechanisms.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no uniform basal endometrial gene expression profile during the implantation window in women who became pregnant in a subsequent ICSI cycle. Only 6 genes (VEGFA, PLA2G2A, ALPL, LIF, NNMT, and STC1) showed a statistically uniform expression among patients who subsequently became pregnant."}
{"answers": "While SSA would be the first region to experience the huge benefits of implementing the \"test and treat\" policy of the WHO, the region is not yet prepared to manage the consequential increased burden of ART-related toxic and metabolic complications. Urgent measures should be taken to fill the lacunae if SSA is not to become over-burdened by the consequences of the \"test and treat\" policy.", "prediction_text": "Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is unlikely to cope effectively with the increased incidence of antiretroviral therapy (ART) related adverse effects resulting from the new \"test and treat\" policy of the World Health Organization (WHO). The region faces significant challenges in terms of poverty, weak health systems, inadequate health services, lack of qualified personnel, and inaccessibility to medicines, which will exacerbate the situation. Additionally, there is a lack of data on the incidence and predictive factors of ART-related adverse effects in SSA, making it difficult to prepare an adequate response plan."}
{"answers": "In summary we believe sudden onset chest wall rigidity may be a significant and previously unreported factor leading to an increased mortality, from illicit IV fentanyl use. Fentanyl and norfentanyl ratios and concentrations suggest a more rapid onset of death given the finding of fentanyl without norfentanyl in many of the fatalities. Chest wall rigidity may help explain the cause of death in these instances, in contrast to the typical opioid-related overdose deaths. Intravenous heroin users should be educated regarding this potentially fatal complication given the increasingly common substitution and combination with heroin of fentanyl.", "prediction_text": "Yes, chest wall rigidity could be a factor in rapid death from illicit fentanyl abuse. The study found that in half of the cases, there was no measurable norfentanyl (the active metabolite of fentanyl) present, suggesting a very rapid onset of death, consistent with acute chest rigidity. Additionally, the lack of any appreciable concentrations of norfentanyl in 42% of the cases and the presence of strikingly high fentanyl concentrations without any norfentanyl detected in some cases also support the idea that chest wall rigidity may play a role in rapid death from illicit f"}
{"answers": "There appears to be no benefit in metformin co-treatment before and during IVF in women with PCO without any other features of PCOS. Clinical Trials.gov: NCT01046032.", "prediction_text": "No, women with ovaries of polycystic morphology without any other features of PCOS do not benefit from short-term metformin co-treatment during IVF in terms of increasing live birth rates or reducing severe OHSS rates."}
{"answers": "The study suggests that ventilating an adult patient is possible with a smaller, pediatric-sized BVM. The tidal volumes recorded with the pediatric BVM were more consistent with lung-protective ventilation volumes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, EMS providers can provide appropriate tidal volumes in a simulated adult-sized patient with a pediatric-sized bag-valve-mask (BVM). The study found that the pediatric BVM provided lower median tidal volumes compared to the adult BVM in all three categories of airway devices, and a greater percentage of breaths delivered in the recommended range occurred when the pediatric BVM was used."}
{"answers": "Our results suggest that colonoscopy does not affect the management of patients with acute diverticulitis nor alter the outcome. The current practice of a routine colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis, diagnosed by typical clinical symptoms and CT needs to be reevaluated.", "prediction_text": "No, a colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis does not significantly affect its management."}
{"answers": "Pretreatment ECG is of limited value for patients with an unremarkable cardiovascular history and a normal heart rate and blood pressure. Hypotension may occur during treatment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, cardiovascular evaluation is necessary prior to and during beta-blocker therapy for infantile hemangiomas. The study found that while there were no serious complications, 6.5% of patients had ECG abnormalities and 9 patients experienced hypotension that did not require therapy adjustment. Additionally, 81% of parents reported side effects during treatment."}
{"answers": "Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is a promising option for lifelong treatment of type 2 diabetes. It has the potential to improve or cure a selected spectrum of type 1 diabetes when performed early in the disease. Further animal model studies or randomized controlled trials are needed to support our conclusion.", "prediction_text": "The current evidence suggests that Roux-en-Y gastric bypass can provide a lifelong solution for diabetes mellitus in obese patients with type 2 diabetes. The article highlights the evolving nature of surgical treatment for diabetes, moving from complex pancreatic and islets transplantation for type 1 diabetes to metabolic surgery, including gastric bypass. The authors note that gastric bypass has proven to be highly effective in treating obese patients and non-obese animals with type 2 diabetes, and that there are shared criteria between types 1 and 2 diabetes that make a selected spectrum of"}
{"answers": "Collectively, results suggest that behavioral adaptation to ESC is likely in certain drivers; however, its proven effectiveness in reducing the likelihood of being involved in a serious crash probably outweighs any potential increases in unsafe driving. To fully benefit from ESC, vehicle manufacturers are encouraged to market ESC-equipped vehicles in a realistic, safe manner. Driver training and safety organizations are also encouraged to provide balanced educational information about ESC to their members.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that the widespread introduction of ESC into the Canadian vehicle fleet may lead to behavioral adaptation among drivers, as some drivers may become too reliant on the technology and change their driving habits as a result."}
{"answers": "The results of the study demonstrate that when clinical supervision uses best practice principles, it can provide professional support for allied health workers, even during times of rapid organisational change.", "prediction_text": "The study found that longer and more frequent supervision sessions, as well as a greater duration of supervision overall, were associated with higher levels of perceived effectiveness of clinical supervision. Additionally, having a say in the allocation of a supervisor and having a clear supervision agreement in place were also significant predictors of higher effectiveness. These findings suggest that clinical supervision can be an effective mechanism for supporting and developing allied health professionals, particularly when it is of a sufficient duration and frequency, and when professionals have a say in the supervision process. However, the study did not specifically address the sustainability of clinical supervision in the current healthcare landscape, and further research is needed to determine the"}
{"answers": "Both 'economic/employment' and 'social/welfare' dimensions of social exclusion significantly influence suicide mortality among males. The influence of 'economic/employment' and 'social/welfare' dimensions of social exclusion on female suicide mortality is controversial. Social exclusion might be considered as a risk factor for suicide mortality in Europe.", "prediction_text": "Yes, some aspects of social exclusion, particularly the \"economic/employment\" and \"social/welfare\" dimensions, are significantly associated with suicide mortality in both males and females in Europe. The relationship between these dimensions and suicide mortality is negative, indicating that better socio-economic conditions are associated with lower suicide rates. However, the influence of the \"social/welfare\" dimension is stronger among females than among males. Additionally, GDP has a positive influence on suicide mortality in both models."}
{"answers": "While ultrasound examination is inexpensive and easily done, it is not accurate enough for staging small penile cancers located at the glans penis. However, for larger tumors ultrasound can be a useful addition to physical examination by delineating reliably the anatomic relations of the tumor to structures such as the tunica albuginea, corpus cavernosum, and urethra.", "prediction_text": "Yes, ultrasound examination is a useful addition to clinical staging in squamous cell carcinoma of the penis, particularly in assessing the extent of invasion into the corpora."}
{"answers": "This study confirms that a large percentage of patients use metered-dose inhalers improperly. It also demonstrates a significant lack of understanding by health care providers of the proper use of metered-dose inhalers. Furthermore, this study supports the use of respiratory care practitioners in the outpatient setting, since they were the most proficient among all the health care providers in the proper use of metered-dose inhalers.", "prediction_text": "Health care providers, including house staff, nurses, and respiratory care practitioners, have varying levels of proficiency in the proper use of metered-dose inhalers. While respiratory care practitioners were the most knowledgeable, a significant percentage of patients and health care providers had a poor understanding of the technique used with metered-dose inhalers."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrated that the regional or global apex of a given curve is the most rotated level in only a minority of the curves. The most rotated level may be as far as two levels from the global apex and one level from the regional apex.", "prediction_text": "No, the transverse apex (most rotated vertebral level) does not always coincide with the coronal apex levels (regional or global) in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. The study found that the regional and global apex levels were at the same level in 54.5% of curves, within half a level in 45.4%, and one level higher in 2% of curves. There was a higher variability in the difference between the most rotated levels and the regional and global apex levels, extending up to two levels for the global apex."}
{"answers": "Generalization of the RCT sample was supported, because only 7.8% of Phenomenology subjects did not fit the RCT criteria. Nevertheless, because the RCT subjects were more severely ill, it is unclear if treatment findings from the RCT will be applicable to children with less severe mania.", "prediction_text": "The \"Treatment of Early Age Mania (TEAM)\" sample does not generalize well to the diagnostic characteristics of child bipolar I disorder. The TEAM sample had a higher prevalence of mania symptoms, ultradian rapid cycling, psychosis, and suicidality compared to the \"Phenomenology and Course of Pediatric Bipolar Disorders\" sample."}
{"answers": "Experts across Europe asserted the right to culturally sensitive health care for all immigrants. There is a broad consensus among experts about the major principles of good practice that need to be implemented across Europe. However, there also is some disagreement both within and between countries on specific issues that require further research and debate.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a broad European consensus on most factors that constitute good practice in health care for immigrants, despite local political debates, level of immigration, and the nature of local health care systems influencing the selection and rating of factors within each country. However, discordance remains both within and between countries, highlighting the need for further discussion and consistency in governance of health care services for immigrants."}
{"answers": "Biochemical analysis of injured cervical intervertebral disks reveals the presence of inflammatory markers such as MCP, fragments of structural matrix proteins such as FAC, and a correlation with pH. Further evaluation of the FAC as a potential diagnostic biomarker or therapeutic target is warranted in the cervical spine.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the fibronectin-aggrecan complex (FAC) was present in the lavage fluid of patients with cervical disk disease, and its concentration was positively correlated with that of monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)."}
{"answers": "Affect-regulated exercise to feel 'good' can be used in a training programme to regulate exercise intensity. This approach led to a 19% increase in time to reach ventilatory threshold, which is indicative of improved fitness.", "prediction_text": "Yes, training at an intensity that feels \"good\" through affect-regulated exercise leads to improved fitness, specifically an increase in time to reach ventilatory threshold, over the course of an 8-week training program in sedentary females."}
{"answers": "In Southern Italy, hepatitis G virus infection is widespread among patients with chronic hepatitis, independently of parenteral risk factors. Its frequency in subjects with cryptogenic liver disease parallels that observed in hepatitis C virus chronic liver disease, thus ruling out an aetiologic role of hepatitis G virus. TT virus infection is uncommon in patients with cryptogenic or hepatitis C virus-related liver disease who do not have a history of parenteral exposure.", "prediction_text": "The study found that hepatitis G virus infection was not significantly different between patients with cryptogenic chronic liver disease and those with hepatitis C virus-related chronic liver disease. However, the study did detect hepatitis G virus RNA in 4 out of 23 patients with cryptogenic chronic hepatitis and 6 out of 40 with hepatitis C virus chronic hepatitis, indicating that hepatitis G virus may play a role in some cases of chronic liver disease."}
{"answers": "Our findings suggest that somatic complaints may represent one, but not necessarily the most important, risk factor for the subsequent development of depressive symptoms in women in nonclinical populations. The results also highlight the importance of including social variables in studies on women's depression as well as conducting additional research to further examine predictors of depressive symptoms in men.", "prediction_text": "Yes, somatic complaints predicted subsequent symptoms of depression in women, but not in men. Baseline scores on the SCL-90-R somatization subscale significantly predicted subsequent self-reported symptoms of depressed mood 5 years later in women, but not in men."}
{"answers": "Peak inspiratory pressure, PEEP, and ventilation index values could distinguish survivors from nonsurvivors by day 3. This may assist in early application of supportive nonconventional therapies in children with malignancy and ARDS.", "prediction_text": "Yes, early respiratory predictors such as peak inspiratory pressure, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and ventilation index can predict outcome in children with hemato-oncology malignancy who develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). These predictors can distinguish between survivors and non-survivors by day 3 after onset of mechanical ventilation, and a significant relationship between respiratory data and outcome related to efficiency of oxygenation is present from day 8."}
{"answers": "In this small study serum inhibin concentrations higher than those found in the early follicular phase one to two weeks after evacuation of a hydatidiform mole seemed to be specific for persistent trophoblastic disease. Further data are needed to confirm these promising results.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that inhibin may be a useful new circulating marker for the diagnosis and monitoring of hydatidiform mole. The concentrations of inhibin in serum and tissue were found to be significantly higher in patients with hydatidiform mole compared to normal pregnant women, and the levels decreased significantly after evacuation of the mole. Additionally, none of the patients whose serum inhibin concentrations were 0.4 U/ml or less after evacuation developed persistent trophoblastic disease. These findings suggest that inhibin may be a useful marker for the early detection and monitoring of hydatidiform mole."}
{"answers": "The integration of whole-lesion dynamic data tends to improve specificity. However, no statistical significance backs up this finding.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that while whole lesion time curve distribution analysis may not be necessary for diagnostic accuracy in MR-mammography, it can provide additional information that may be useful in certain cases. The most suspect curve and combined dynamic data had higher diagnostic accuracy than the curve-type distribution percentage, but the differences did not reach statistical significance. Therefore, while the study suggests that whole lesion time curve distribution analysis may not be essential, it can be a useful tool in certain cases."}
{"answers": "The seemingly exaggerated traditional fear of anaphylaxis seems to discourage surgeons from more widely adopting minimal access techniques for the treatment of hydatid cyst.", "prediction_text": "Yes, fear of anaphylactic shock is a significant discouragement for surgeons to adopt percutaneous and laparoscopic techniques in the treatment of liver hydatid cysts."}
{"answers": "Grandmultiparous women had increased maternal and neonatal morbidity, and neonatal mortality even after controlling for confounders, suggesting a need for closer observation than regular multiparous patients during labor and delivery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, grandmultiparity is an independent risk factor for several adverse perinatal outcomes, including abruptio placentae, preterm delivery, fetal macrosomia, neonatal death, postpartum hemorrhage, and blood transfusion."}
{"answers": "No single data source is likely to provide a complete health profile for an individual. For women with depression in pregnancy and dispensed antidepressants, the hospital admission data do not adequately capture all cases.", "prediction_text": "The study found that only 13.6% of pregnant women who were dispensed antidepressants had depression recorded as a comorbidity on their hospital records, indicating that many women with major depression in pregnancy may not be identifiable in population health data using administrative records alone. The study suggests that data linkage methods can help identify a larger proportion of women with depression, with an estimated prevalence of around 16%."}
{"answers": "These data suggest a pattern of diagnostic stability over time for manic and mixed episodes in patients with bipolar disorder. Careful prospective studies of this issue are needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the manic/mixed episode distinction in patients with bipolar disorder runs true over time, with a significantly higher proportion of patients experiencing consistent patterns of manic and mixed episodes compared to what would be expected by chance."}
{"answers": "The analyses show that structural characteristics of a practice are not associated with uptake of a new IT facility, but that its use may be influenced by post-graduate education in the relevant clinical condition. For this diabetes system at least, practice nurse use was critical in spreading uptake beyond initial GP enthusiasts and for sustained and rising use in subsequent years.", "prediction_text": "Yes, general practice characteristics are associated with uptake of an IT innovation in primary care, specifically the numbers of diabetes-educated staff. Greater use of the IT innovation was found among practices with more diabetes-educated staff, particularly among nurses."}
{"answers": "GAPS, a simple clinical score, is a better predictor of admission than triage nurses, unless the nurse is sure about the outcome, in which case their clinical judgement should be respected.", "prediction_text": "Yes, nurses were found to be better than a simple objective score (GAPS) in predicting admission at triage. While GAPS had a similar discrimination (AUC) to nurses, it was significantly worse in terms of calibration and accuracy, overestimating admission likelihood by 6.6% compared to nurses. When using GAPS but over-ruling it when clinical certainty was \u226595%, a hybrid approach that incorporates both objective scoring and clinical judgement, accuracy improved to 82.5%."}
{"answers": "Our data showed no difference in 25(OH) D levels between normal children and those with CD when adjusted for body mass index.", "prediction_text": "No, vitamin D deficiency is not a feature of pediatric celiac disease in this study. There was no significant difference in vitamin D levels between children with celiac disease and non-celiac children, and when the patients were subdivided into obese and non-obese groups, the non-obese celiac patients had a higher vitamin D level than the obese normal children."}
{"answers": "Granulomatous myelotoxicity and enteritis developed in a 21 year old female within 3 weeks of initiating sulfasalazine for rheumatoid arthritis. Following a short course of corticosteroids, the patient had resolution of her cholestatic hepatitis, rash, eosinophilia, and gastrointestinal symptoms with no residual manifestations at 7 months follow-up. Although severe reactions to sulfasalazine are rare and unpredictable, practicing physicians should be aware of unusual clinical presentations of toxicity when prescribing sulfasalazine.", "prediction_text": "No, the patient in the paper does not have Crohn's disease. The patient is described as having rheumatoid arthritis, which is a different inflammatory bowel disease."}
{"answers": "Healthy lifestyles lead to an increase in the utilization of preventive health services. However, there is not much significantly reducing the number of outpatient visits in people with health behaviors. Specifically, people with regular exercise habits and who take their blood pressure measurement regularly have an increased number of outpatient visits. It is suggested that more available and accessible health consultation services be provided to inculcate in the general public the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle.", "prediction_text": "Yes, this study found that individuals with better health behaviors (e.g. exercise habits, dietary habits, regular blood pressure measurement, and abstinence from drinking) had lower utilization of healthcare resources, as measured by the number of outpatient visits and health examinations."}
{"answers": "Parental restriction of R-rated movie viewing is associated with both lower adolescent smoking susceptibility and lower smoking rates.", "prediction_text": "Yes, parental restriction of R-rated movie viewing is associated with lower adolescent smoking susceptibility. The study found that adolescents who had partial or no restriction on R-rated movie viewing were more likely to be susceptible to smoking compared to those with full restriction, after controlling for demographic factors and family and friend smoking."}
{"answers": "Having a usual physician can be an effective tool in improving access to care for low-income populations, although it is most effective when combined with insurance coverage. However, the effectiveness of managed care in linking more low-income persons to a medical home is uncertain, and may have unintended consequences for uninsured persons.", "prediction_text": "No, managed care does not enable more low-income persons to identify a usual source of care. In fact, high managed care penetration in the community is associated with a lower likelihood of having a usual source of care for uninsured persons."}
{"answers": "Locally 1.0% ropivacaine administration significantly relieves the pain of pediatric tonsillectomy and, it is a safe and effective method. High concentrations of ropivaciane may produce clinically significant pain relief. It is more effective to reduce of post-operative analgesic requirement after first hour.", "prediction_text": "Yes, topical ropivacaine hydrochloride reduces post-tonsillectomy morbidity in pediatric patients, specifically in terms of pain control, with a statistically significant difference observed in the first hour after surgery, and thereafter."}
{"answers": "Minimally invasive mitral valve repair using neochords provided a high rate of repair, reproducible results in a routine cardiac surgery setting and stable repair during follow-up. This has become our preferred technique for mitral valve surgery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, minimally invasive mitral valve repair with artificial chords is reproducible and applicable in routine surgery. The study found that the use of neochords in video-assisted mitral valve repair resulted in a high repair rate, low regurgitation rates, and low complication rates, with all patients remaining free of mitral regurgitation at follow-up."}
{"answers": "Comparisons of absolute EOA values grouped by the manufacturers' valve sizes are misleading because of specific differences in geometric dimensions. The EOA:patient aortic annulus area ratio provides a new hemodynamic index which may facilitate objective comparisons between different valve types.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the effective orifice area (EOA) / patient aortic annulus area ratio is a better way to compare different bioprostheses, as it takes into account the individual patient's anatomy and valve dimensions, rather than just the prosthesis size."}
{"answers": "Women compared to men often delay seeking treatment for an AMI, which further increases their risks. Our findings suggest specific characteristics that can serve as a profile to those African Americans most likely to delay seeking treatment for AMI.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that women were more likely than men to delay seeking medical help due to reasons related to social and cultural factors, such as being alone when symptoms began and not having someone to accompany them to the hospital."}
{"answers": "A reduced alveolar macrophage phagocytic host response to apoptotic cells or NTHi may contribute to neutrophilic inflammation and NTHi colonization in both PBB and bronchiectasis. Whether this mechanism also contributes to the progression of PBB to bronchiectasis remains unknown.", "prediction_text": "Yes, alveolar macrophage phagocytic dysfunction is a forerunner to bronchiectasis in children with protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB). Children with PBB and bronchiectasis have lower phagocytic capacity and efferocytosis compared to control subjects, indicating impaired macrophage function. Reduced mannose receptor expression and increased IL-1\u03b2 levels further support the idea that macrophage dysfunction is a key feature of these diseases."}
{"answers": "Cervical physical therapy can have a positive effect on subjective tinnitus complaints in patients with a combination of tinnitus and neck complaints. Larger studies, using more responsive outcome measures, are however necessary to prove this effect.", "prediction_text": "Yes, multi-modal cervical physical therapy significantly improved tinnitus complaints in patients with cervicogenic somatic tinnitus (CST). Tinnitus scores decreased significantly after treatment and remained lower after follow-up at 6 weeks."}
{"answers": "Because workers may have an elevated relative aerobic workload for several hours each working day, this relationship may elucidate a mechanism behind the increased risk for cardiovascular disease among workers exposed to high levels of occupational physical activity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a positive relationship between aerobic workload and ambulatory blood pressure."}
{"answers": "Our investigation did not undoubtedly prove that significant changes of fetal biometric parameters occurred in the last three decades. It is possible that secular growth acceleration does not exist in prenatal period but also the observed time period could have been short for this phenomenon to manifest.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no statistically significant difference in fetal biometric parameters between the current population and those from 35 years ago, indicating that secular growth acceleration does not occur during fetal life."}
{"answers": "Consistent with prior studies, we found an inverse relationship between obesity and serum prostate specific antigen. However, the magnitude of the difference was small. Thus, adjusting prostate specific antigen for body mass index does not appear warranted.", "prediction_text": "No, prostate specific antigen should not be adjusted for body mass index in men without prostate cancer, as there was no significant association between the two variables after adjusting for age."}
{"answers": "Emergency laparotomy carries a high rate of mortality, especially in those over the age of 70 years, and more needs to be done to improve outcomes, particularly in this group. This could involve increasing acute surgical care manpower, early recognition of patients requiring emergency surgery, development of clear management protocols for such patients or perhaps even considering centralisation of emergency surgical services to specialist centres with multidisciplinary teams involving emergency surgeons and care of the elderly physicians in hospital and related community outreach services for post-discharge care.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that there is a significant difference in 30-day and 1-year mortality rates between patients aged <70 and >70 years undergoing emergency laparotomy, with higher mortality rates observed in the older age group. This highlights the need for improved care and strategies to establish best practices in this area to reduce mortality rates."}
{"answers": "[corrected] This observation is exceptional in many aspects: very early age of onset of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, no immune deficit, association with a rare congenital neurological syndrome. We discuss the possible link between this entity and the occurrence of tuberculosis.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a possible causative link between Say-Barber-Miller syndrome and the occurrence of cerebromediastinal tuberculosis in an immuno-competent child."}
{"answers": "The signal intensity on DWI showed no significant difference in the development of vascularization.", "prediction_text": "No, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is not a significant indicator of the development of vascularization in hypovascular hepatocellular lesions (HHLs). The study found that the 730-day cumulative development of vascularization in hypointense, isointense, and hyperintense lesions was not significantly different."}
{"answers": "General practitioners should consider using patients' first names more often, particularly with younger patients.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, the majority of patients (223) liked being called by their first names by general practitioners, while only 77 disliked it. However, the majority of patients (324) did not want to call the doctor by their first name. Therefore, the answer to the question is no, general practitioners should not call patients by their first names."}
{"answers": "Patients after ART treatment suffer from higher C-section rates during their stage of delivery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that patients who conceived through Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) had higher rates of cesarean sections (C-sections) compared to those who conceived spontaneously. Specifically, the groups of fresh transferred embryos and slow freezing had higher risks of both elective and emergency C-sections."}
{"answers": "Trauma patients have a significant complication rate related to anticoagulation therapy, and predicting which patients will develop a complication remains unclear. Prospective studies are needed to determine which treatment regimen, if any, is appropriate to safely anticoagulate this high risk population.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the incidence of complications of therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients was 21%. The patient factors associated with complications were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, use of unfractionated heparin (UH), and lower initial platelet count. The study suggests that therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients is not entirely safe and that patient factors need to be carefully considered when initiating anticoagulation therapy."}
{"answers": "A significant difference in dental health between recruits to each Service does exist and is a likely to be a reflection of the sociodemographic background from which they are drawn.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant differential in dental health between new recruits to the British Armed Forces, with the Army having the highest prevalence of dental decay and greatest treatment resource need compared to the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force."}
{"answers": "In light of the large sample size and prior pilot testing of presented images, results suggest that episodic migraineurs do not differentially attend to headache-related facial stimuli. Given modest evidence of attentional biases among chronic headache samples, these findings suggest potential differences in attentional processing between chronic and episodic headache subforms.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no evidence to suggest that episodic migraineurs selectively attend to headache-related visual stimuli. The study found no differences in attentional bias indices between migraine and non-migraine groups, both for headache-related and happy facial stimuli."}
{"answers": "Under the conditions of this study, preclerkship (year 2) CPEs strongly predicted medical students at risk for failing a senior CPE. This finding opens the opportunity for remediation of deficits prior to or during clerkships.", "prediction_text": "Yes, students' scores on preclerkship clinical performance examinations can predict that they will fail a senior clinical performance examination. The study found that students who performed poorly on year 2 clinical performance examinations were at a high risk of failing the senior examination."}
{"answers": "Our results suggest that people do not attach a simple fixed premium to \"safety-related\" interventions but that preferences depend more subtly on context. The use of the results of such public preference surveys to directly inform policy would therefore be premature.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the public values interventions that prevent hospital-acquired infections more highly than interventions related to genetic disorders, and gives less weight to interventions related to lifestyle and sports injuries."}
{"answers": "Minimising the radiation dose to one of the parotid glands with the help of IMRT in patients with advanced head and neck cancers can prevent xerostomia in most patients and parotid scintigraphy is a useful method of documenting xerostomia.", "prediction_text": "The study found that dose reduction to one parotid gland does not prevent xerostomia in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancers undergoing intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with or without chemotherapy. In fact, the study found that only 2 out of 19 patients had grade III xerostomia, despite the parotid gland being spared on one side in most of the patients. The study suggests that other factors, such as the total dose received by the parotid gland and the timing of radiation therapy, may be more important in predicting xerostomia than the unilateral sparing of the parotid"}
{"answers": "It is important to continue FA supplementation over the long term in patients on methotrexate and FA in order to prevent them discontinuing treatment because of mouth ulcers or nausea and vomiting. Our data suggest that FA supplementation is also helpful in preventing neutropenia, with very little loss of efficacy of methotrexate.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that stopping folic acid supplementation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) established on methotrexate and folic acid may result in increased toxicity, including neutropenia, and may also lead to decreased efficacy of methotrexate. Therefore, the authors recommend continuing folic acid supplementation in these patients long term."}
{"answers": "LF and cruroplasty is feasible and has good results in terms of GERD symptoms control and additional weight loss. The high rate of postoperative complications observed in this series remains a matter of concern. A re-sleeve procedure might be considered as an alternative to RYGB/DS conversion restricted to selected patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, laparoscopic fundectomy (LF) is safe and effective as revision surgery for patients with residual fundus or neofundus after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) for GERD symptoms. The study found that LF resulted in significant improvements in GERD symptoms and weight loss in both groups, with Group B experiencing additional weight loss of 53.4% at 24 months. However, there were some postoperative complications, including bleeding, mid-gastric stenosis, and leaks, with a total of 10.5% of complications occurring."}
{"answers": "VAT area measurement at a single level 3 cm above the lower margin of the L3 vertebra is feasible and can reflect changes in VAT volume and body weight. Advances in knowledge: As VAT area at a CT slice 3cm above the lower margin of L3 can best reflect interval changes in VAT volume and body weight, VAT area measurement should be selected at this location.", "prediction_text": "Yes, visceral adipose tissue area measurement at a single level (specifically, 3 cm above the lower margin of L3) can represent visceral adipose tissue volume changes. The study found the strongest correlations between VAT area and VAT volume changes at this slice location."}
{"answers": "Barrett's cytokeratin 7/20 pattern can be a useful marker for the diagnosis of short-segment Barrett's oesophagus, although the false positive or false negative rate is approximately 25%.", "prediction_text": "Yes, cytokeratin immunoreactivity is useful in the diagnosis of short-segment Barrett's oesophagus in Korea. The study found that Barrett's cytokeratin 7/20 pattern was observed in 77.8% of short-segment Barrett's oesophagus cases, with a sensitivity and specificity of 77.8 and 77.5%, respectively."}
{"answers": "In this paper the effect of lunar phases on the time of delivery is shown. This influence seems to be especially relevant in the case of multiparae and plurigravidae. Nevertheless, it is too weak to allow for prediction regarding the days with the highest frequency of deliveries.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the lunar position appears to influence the time of delivery, with a higher frequency of spontaneous full-term deliveries occurring around the full moon, particularly in multiparae and plurigravidae."}
{"answers": "Financial incentives for smoking cessation in pregnancy are highly cost-effective, with an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life years of \u00a3482, which is well below recommended decision thresholds.", "prediction_text": "Financial incentives of up to \u00a3400 for smoking cessation during pregnancy are likely to be cost-effective, with an incremental cost per quitter of \u00a31127 and an incremental cost-utility ratio (ICER) of \u00a3482 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). However, the results are uncertain and may vary depending on relapse rates after birth. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggests that additional research is potentially worthwhile to reduce uncertainty."}
{"answers": "This data demonstrates the robust nature of the short stay ward. At these two very different institutions we have shown improved bed efficient and patient care in a cost-effective way. We have also reported on greater parental satisfaction and early return of the child with their family to the community.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the short stay or 23-hour ward in a general and academic children's hospital is effective in increasing hospital efficiency and reducing costs. The study found that the short stay ward accounted for a significant proportion of admissions (10.3% and 14.7% at Westmead Hospital and the New Children's Hospital, respectively), with similar admission patterns and outcomes compared to the main hospital wards. The average length of stay in the short stay ward was significantly shorter than in the main hospital wards, and the rate of patient admission to an in-hospital bed and unscheduled visits within 72 hours of discharge was low. Additionally, there"}
{"answers": "Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery is a safe method of treatment in patients with Cushing's disease. Operative findings, radiological and histological findings, together with early postoperative serum cortisol and urine free cortisol estimates may identify failures in treatment. Alternative treatment might then be required for these patients. Because of the risk of late relapse, patients require life-long follow-up.", "prediction_text": "Yes, several factors can predict the outcome of transsphenoidal pituitary surgery in patients with Cushing's disease. These include:"}
{"answers": "Patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms have a great diversity of functional somatic symptoms. They use more somatic and psychotropic drugs than controls in the years before diagnosis. Moreover, they show high rates of referrals and psychiatric morbidity. The diversity of symptoms of patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms supports the concept that symptoms do not cluster in well defined distinct syndromes. Therefore, patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms should preferably not be classified into medical subspecialty syndromes.", "prediction_text": "No, the study suggests that chronic functional somatic symptoms are not a single syndrome, but rather a complex and heterogeneous group of conditions. The study found distinctive features in patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms, including more comorbidity, higher medication use, and more frequent referrals to mental health workers and somatic specialists, compared to controls. However, the study did not support the hypothesis of a single somatic syndrome."}
{"answers": "The vast majority of MDT decisions are implemented. Management alteration was most often due to patient choice or additional information available after the MDT. A minority of management alterations were 'unjustifiable' and the authors recommend that any patient whose treatment is subsequently changed should have MDT rediscussion prior to treatment.", "prediction_text": "In this study, 91.5% of multidisciplinary team decisions for breast cancer management were found to be concordant with subsequent patient management, while 4.5% were discordant and 4% had no MDT decision. Of the discordant decisions, 17.8% were considered \"unjustifiable\" as there was no additional information available after the MDT to account for the change in management, while the remaining 82.2% were considered \"justifiable\" due to patient choice, additional information available after the MDT, or MDT error."}
{"answers": "We found that 1.6% of S. aureus (all MSSA) from bacteraemic patients were PVL-positive. This low incidence suggests that PVL-positive S. aureus are of no particular significance as causative agents of S. aureus bacteraemia.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL) is not associated with the pathogenesis of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia in the UK. Of the 244 S. aureus isolates from bacteraemic patients, only four (1.6%) were PVL-positive, and none of these isolates were oxacillin-resistant (methicillin-resistant S. aureus). The study suggests that other factors may be more important in the pathogenesis of S. aureus bacteraemia in this population."}
{"answers": "These findings are in accordance with previous experimental work and provide additional support for the assertion that dogs can prime autistic children for therapy. Ultimately, this study may contribute toward a change for full acceptance of canine-assisted therapy programs within the medical milieu. Additional studies using a similar research protocol on more autistic children will certainly help professionals to work on the most effective methods to individually serve this population through canine-assisted interventions.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that dogs can prime autistic children for therapy. The participant exhibited more frequent and longer durations of positive behaviors, such as smiling and physical contacting, and less frequent and shorter durations of negative behaviors, such as aggressive manifestations, when exposed to the treatment condition with a certified therapy dog present. This suggests that the dog may have helped the participant to engage in more positive behaviors and reduce negative behaviors during therapy."}
{"answers": "We conclude that increased cardiovascular risk of the DD genotype is not mediated through insulin resistance or abnormalities in fibrinolysis. Conversely, we report an increased sensitivity in NIDDM subjects with the ACE DD genotype.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the insertion allele (I) of the ACE gene I/D polymorphism is associated with insulin resistance in non-insulin-dependent diabetic (NIDDM) subjects, as well as in nondiabetic white subjects."}
{"answers": "A history of PIPE may be a risk factor for the development of IPE. Yet, the disappearance of significance on multivariate analysis indicates that it is not an independent predictor.", "prediction_text": "Yes, postictal psychotic episodes (PIPE) are predictive of the development of interictal psychotic episodes (IPE) in patients with a partial seizure disorder. In this study, a history of PIPE, male gender, and having bilateral ictal foci were found to be predictive of IPE in univariate logistic regression analyses, but these variables lost significance in multivariate analysis."}
{"answers": "QTcD is significantly increased in hypertensive patients with LVH compared with those without, being strongly correlated with the indices of LVH. A QTcD cut-off value of 60 ms predicted LVH in hypertensive patients with a high sensitivity and specificity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, corrected QT dispersion (QTcD) can predict left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in hypertensive patients. The study found that hypertensive patients had significantly greater indices of LVH and QTcD compared to normotensive controls, and that QTcD was able to predict LVH with a high sensitivity and specificity in hypertensive patients."}
{"answers": "The shaving of the incision site immediately before spinal surgery may increase the rate of postoperative infection.", "prediction_text": "Yes, shaving the incision site before spinal surgery increases the postsurgical infection rate."}
{"answers": "The majority of EMS professionals thought that they should participate in disease and injury prevention programs. The respondents were mixed as to whether prevention services should be provided while on emergency calls, but those with experience providing these services were more likely to agree with providing them during emergency calls.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the majority of emergency medical services (EMS) professionals (82.7%) believe that EMS professionals should participate in disease prevention programs."}
{"answers": "Current K/DOQI guidelines are inadequate for correcting VDDI or secondary hyperparathyroidism in CKD patients. Future studies should examine the effects of higher or more frequent dosing of ergocalciferol on these clinical endpoints.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the current K/DOQI recommended doses of ergocalciferol may not be adequate for correcting vitamin D deficiency and hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Only 26% of patients had a>or = 30% decrease in their intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) level after treatment with ergocalciferol, and only 54% had a>or = 5 ng/ml increase in their 25-hydroxyvitamin D level. These findings suggest that more aggressive vitamin D supplementation may be needed to achieve ade"}
{"answers": "Baseline pain intensity does not predict the outcome after an appropriate opioid titration. It is likely that non-homogeneous pain treatment would have biased the outcome of a previous work.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no correlation between baseline pain intensity categories and opioid response in cancer patients."}
{"answers": "Maintaining viral load suppression over time in resource-limited-settings is feasible.", "prediction_text": "In a resource-limited setting, it is feasible to maintain HIV viral load suppression over time with treatment as prevention (TasP) strategies. Of the 619 patients on follow-up, 82 (13.2%) were diagnosed in the pre-HAART era, and 79 (96.3%) patients were on HAART with a median duration of 14 years (IQR 12-15) of therapy. Despite exposure to mono or dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors regimens in 47.8% of cases, 69 patients (87.3%) had und"}
{"answers": "Mucosal redundancy is a constant associated finding in IHPS. Although the origin of the redundancy and a cause-and-effect relationship are difficult to establish, our findings support the hypothesis that hypergastrinemia may be implicated in the pathogenesis of IHPS, and suggest that mucosal thickening could be implicated as one of the initiating factors in its development.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is an etiologic role of pyloric mucosal hypertrophy in the development of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS) in infants. The study found that the pyloric mucosa is consistently hypertrophic in infants with HPS, and this hypertrophy may play a role in the development of the condition."}
{"answers": "Given the available screening technologies, discordant TEOAE and AABR may be inevitable for some categories of hearing loss among apparently healthy newborns whose mothers received prenatal care. The potential limitations of perinatal morbidities as basis of targeted screening for such cases therefore merit further consideration.", "prediction_text": "Yes, discordance in TEOAE and AABR outcomes can be predicted in newborns based on various maternal and infant factors. Antenatal care status, mode of delivery, and nursery type were found to be useful predictors of discordant outcomes among all infants undergoing screening."}
{"answers": "GM of CRC and SLM was associated with fewer procedures but did not influence overall survival. SM was associated with a longer delay and increased use of chemotherapy between procedures, suggesting that more rigorous selection of SM patients for surgery may explain the higher disease-free survival after SLM resection.", "prediction_text": "Global management of colorectal cancer with synchronous liver metastases (SLM) at the same centre as the colorectal surgery may improve outcomes compared to separate management at different centers. The study found that patients who received global management had lower mean number of procedures (CRC+SLM), lower 3-month mortality, and higher 3-year and 5-year overall survival rates compared to those who received separate management."}
{"answers": "epiDWI has the potential to differentiate pleomorphic adenoma and myoepithelial adenomas from all other examined entities. Due to an overlap not only within the group of benign and malignant lesions but also between groups, diagnoses should not be addressed on the basis of ADC values solely. Therefore, further studies combining DWI, morphologic criteria, and probably other MR imaging techniques seem warranted.", "prediction_text": "Yes, epiDWI can predict different histologic subtypes of primary parotid gland tumors with a high degree of accuracy. Pleomorphic adenomas have significantly higher ADC values than other subtypes, while Warthin tumors can be differentiated from myoepithelial adenomas, lipomas, and salivary duct carcinomas based on their distinct ADC values."}
{"answers": "The survey shows significant dissatisfaction amongst consultant radiologists with the current service, confirms a low number of paediatric radiologists taking on this work, and suggests the potential to increase numbers of radiology child abuse experts by 27% if given improved training and support. Appropriate service and education strategies should be implemented.", "prediction_text": "UK radiologists are not satisfied with the training and support received in suspected child abuse, with only 52% of departments having a dedicated paediatric radiologist and 73% of respondents indicating that they would never consider providing expert evidence in these cases."}
{"answers": "The enhancement of serum TNFalpha and IL-6 levels in the patients with ERCP-induced pancreatitis reflects the inflammatory activity. Additionally, these cytokines together with IL-4 can be used in clinical laboratory monitoring of ERCP.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the changes in the serum levels of IL-2, IL-4, TNFalpha, and IL-6 reflect the inflammatory activity in the patients with post-ERCP pancreatitis. The study found that the levels of IL-4 at 24 hours after ERCP were significantly lower in the patients with post-ERCP pancreatitis, while the levels of TNFalpha at 12 hours after ERCP were higher in the complicated group than those of the uncomplicated group. Additionally, the ratios of TNFalpha/IL-4 at 12 and 24 hours after ERCP were found significantly higher in the patients with post-ERCP pancre"}
{"answers": "During the 5 years, 24% of Africans with optimal BP developed hypertension. The surge in hypertension in Africa is largely explained by modifiable risk factors. Public health strategies should focus aggressively on lifestyle to prevent a catastrophic burden on the national health system.", "prediction_text": "Yes, behavioral risk factors such as smoking, waist circumference, and alcohol intake were found to be independently associated with the conversion from optimal blood pressure to hypertensive status in Black South Africans."}
{"answers": "Our data have revealed a number of differences. Compared to the clinic sample, the Web-based sample had worse psychological symptom burden, younger average age, higher prevalence of employment, and a lower proportion on ART. For future research, we recommend that Web-based data collection should include the demographic variables that we note differed between samples. In addition, we recognize that each recruitment method may bring inherent sampling bias, with clinic populations differing by geographical location and reflecting those accessing regular medical care, and Web-based sampling recruiting those with greater Internet access and identifying survey materials through specific searches and contact with specific websites.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that the Web-based sample of gay men living with HIV reported higher levels of psychological symptoms compared to the clinic sample, after controlling for potential confounding variables. Specifically, the Web-based sample was more likely to report being in the upper (worst) tertile for psychological symptom burden, compared to the clinic sample. In contrast, the Web-based sample was not significantly different from the clinic sample in terms of self-reported physical symptom burden."}
{"answers": "The majority of acetabular components in this cohort were stable despite the small contact surface achieved between the component and pelvic bone. Three of 10 migrated in excess of the limits that predict later loosening in primary THA but it remains to be seen whether these limits apply to this selected group of frail osteoporotic patients. We continue to use this technique routinely to treat patients with the same indications, but since the analysis of these data we have added screw fixation of the acetabular component to the ischial tuberosity and the superior pubic ramus.", "prediction_text": "The study found that cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups does not provide initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures. At 1 year postoperatively, three of the 10 components had migration above the suggested limits for primary THA, indicating a lack of initial stability. Additionally, the contact surface achieved between the acetabular component and pelvis was found to be variable, ranging from 11 to 17 cm(2) (15%-27% of each component). These findings suggest that other techniques may be more effective in providing initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures"}
{"answers": "Despite high perioperative mortality, results document a sustainable recovery of the survivors offering the prospect of a highly independent and satisfying life. Therefore, advanced age alone should not be a contraindication for redo cardiac interventions. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2016; 16: 1138-1144.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that cardiac reoperations in octogenarians can be beneficial in terms of improving functional status and quality of life, with a high rate of survival and low in-hospital mortality. However, the study also found that a significant proportion of patients died during follow-up, highlighting the need for careful selection and close monitoring of these patients."}
{"answers": "Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (ie, SMI) were more likely than other patients to be admitted to nursing homes with higher deficiency citations for both overall quality and clinical care quality. Further research is necessary to understand the reasons behind the disparity in quality of nursing home care associated with SMI.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patients with serious mental illness (SMI) are more likely to be admitted to nursing homes with higher deficiencies in care compared to other patients. Specifically, patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder tend to enter nursing homes with more total and healthcare-related deficiencies, after controlling for various factors."}
{"answers": "Patients undergoing open access procedures are less likely to be properly informed about their endoscopic procedure. Our results indicate that with open access endoscopy, a defined mechanism needs to be in place for communication of endoscopic results to the patient.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that patients who accessed endoscopy through the open access route received less information about the procedure and less explanation of its nature compared to patients referred from a gastrointestinal subspecialty clinic. This suggests that the open access model may not provide adequate opportunities for informed consent and patient education."}
{"answers": "Contrary to common belief, we found that uterine myomas commonly decrease in volume over the course of pregnancy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, according to the study, uterine myomas tend to enlarge during pregnancy, with a mean increase in volume of 69% in the second trimester and 102% in the last trimester, suggesting that myomas may grow during pregnancy."}
{"answers": "We found that all of the studied dimensions of restricted fetal growth are independently associated with increased risks of low intellectual performance and that these associations are only partly mediated by socioeconomic or familial factors.", "prediction_text": "The associations between birth characteristics and low intellectual performance in early adulthood are not significantly confounded by socioeconomic factors in adolescence or familial effects."}
{"answers": "Although feasible, double reading of barium enemas does not improve sensitivity for detection of polyps and produces a higher false-positive rate.", "prediction_text": "Double reading of barium enemas increases the number of positive results and has the potential to alter clinical treatment in some patients, but the specificity decreases. The addition of a second reader does not significantly improve the sensitivity for the detection of adenocarcinomas. Therefore, while double reading may be beneficial, it is not strictly necessary for all patients."}
{"answers": "The VMPA can provide direct access and favorable visibility to the TMJ region and yield good esthetic and functional results. The VMPA can be considered the approach of choice for common TMJ surgeries.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the vascular-guided multilayer preauricular approach (VMPA) to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) can improve access and reduce complications compared to traditional approaches. The study found that all patients had successful TMJ surgeries through the VMPA, with no patient developing permanent weakness of the facial nerve or other severe complications. Additionally, the operating times were shorter and patients experienced fewer incision scars with the VMPA compared to traditional approaches."}
{"answers": "The metastasis rate of station 9 lymph nodes was significantly lower than other mediastinal stations in lung cancer patients. The metastasis status of station 9 had no significant influence on tumor staging or prognosis. Routine dissection of station 9 lymph nodes may not be necessary, especially in patients with a low T stage, upper or middle lobe tumors, or without intrapulmonary lymph node metastasis.", "prediction_text": "Based on the study, routine dissection of station 9 lymph nodes during lung cancer surgery is not necessary. The metastasis rate of station 9 was found to be significantly lower than other mediastinal stations, and the absence of station 9 dissection did not significantly impair the staging results or prognosis of most patients."}
{"answers": "During the time period considered, the FDA AED-related suicidality warning does not appear to have significantly affected prescription claims of AED medications for the study population.", "prediction_text": "No significant change in trend was detected in antiepileptic drug (AED) prescription claims among members with epilepsy and/or psychiatric disorder following the FDA suicidality warning."}
{"answers": "In our population of stroke survivors, self-reports of motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions differed from government records. In future studies, the use of both government and self-reported data would ensure a more accurate picture of driving safety post-stroke.", "prediction_text": "There is a moderate agreement between government records (MTO) and self-reported data on motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions for stroke survivors, with a kappa coefficient of 0.52 for collisions and 0.47 for convictions. However, when both sources of data were consulted, up to 56% more accidents and up to 46% more convictions were identified in the study population in the 5 years before study entry compared to when either source was used alone."}
{"answers": "The realized communication skills courses resulted in relevant changes in communication behaviour and self-confidence of participants. Communication with terminally ill patients can be taught.", "prediction_text": "Yes, communication with terminally ill patients can be taught through a structured course model. The study demonstrated that participants' communication behavior improved after participating in a 2-day course, with significant increases in their sense of security in different communication settings, such as communicating a diagnosis of cancer with good or less good prognosis, recurrence of cancer, or a far progressive cancer disease without curative approach. The course was well-evaluated by participants, with high satisfaction scores and evidence of meaningful changes in communication behavior 3 months after the course."}
{"answers": "For conditions with a well-developed quality of care evidence base, such as hypertension and diabetes, a single structured implicit review to assess the quality of care over a period of time is moderately reliable. This method could be a reasonable complement or alternative to explicit indicator approaches for assessing and comparing quality of care. Structured implicit review, like explicit quality measures, must be used more cautiously for illnesses for which the evidence base is less well developed, such as COPD and acute, short-course illnesses.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a role for peer review in profiling quality of care, particularly for conditions with a well-established evidence base. The study found that the reliability of implicit review was higher for conditions with a more developed evidence base, such as diabetes and hypertension, compared to conditions with a less developed evidence base, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and a collection of acute conditions. This suggests that peer review can be a useful tool for evaluating the quality of care for these conditions. However, it is important to note that the reliability of peer review can vary depending on the condition and the specific method used, and further research is needed to determine the optimal approach for profiling quality"}
{"answers": "The high rate of unsuccessful IUD insertions reported here, particularly for nulliparous women, suggests that the true insertion failure rate of providers who are not employing additional tools for difficult insertions may be much higher than reported in clinical trials. Further investigation is necessary to determine if this is a common problem and, if so, to assess if the use of adjuvant measures will reduce the number of unsuccessful IUD insertions.", "prediction_text": "Yes, failed IUD insertions in community practice are an under-recognized problem, particularly among nulliparous women. The study found that the rate of unsuccessful IUD insertions was higher among nulliparous women compared to parous women, with an adjusted odds ratio of 2.31. This suggests that nulliparous women may be at a higher risk of IUD insertion failure in community practice settings."}
{"answers": "Even in capped health care systems, virtual planning and guided surgery including prebent or milled plates are financially viable.", "prediction_text": "Yes, virtual planning and guided surgery for head and neck reconstruction are economically viable. The study found that the additional cost of virtual planning was reduced by 75-85% when compared to freehand surgery, making it a cost-effective option."}
{"answers": "Bipolarity does not independently influence risk of suicidal behavior or alter the influence of well-established suicide risk factors within affective disorders. Suicide risk assessment strategies may continue to appraise these common risk factors without regard to mood polarity.", "prediction_text": "No, the risk factors for suicidal behavior do not differ by affective disorder polarity."}
{"answers": "The administration of polyvalent Crotalidae antivenin is safe. Acute hypersensitivity, when it occurs, consists solely in most cases of urticaria. Serious side effects are uncommon.", "prediction_text": "No, the aggressive use of polyvalent antivenin for rattlesnake bites does not result in serious acute side effects, such as death, amputations, or permanent disability, in the studied population. In fact, the use of antivenin was associated with a low incidence of acute side effects, primarily consisting of urticaria, in the majority of patients."}
{"answers": "Although endomyocardial fibrosis patients have improved clinical symptoms after surgery, the global left ventricular ejection fraction and regional wall motion in these patients do not change. This finding suggests that other explanations, such as improvements in diastolic function, may be operational.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no change in quantitative left ventricular regional wall motion after fibrous tissue resection in endomyocardial fibrosis."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrates that laser pretreatment significantly increases absorption of topical lidocaine so that it is detectable in the blood and that manipulating laser settings can affect drug absorption. Future work will look at translating this effect into clinical benefit.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that fractional lasers can enhance transdermal absorption of topical lidocaine in an in vivo animal model. The peak levels of lidocaine and its metabolite monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) were significantly higher in the laser-treated skin compared to untreated skin. Specifically, the peak levels of lidocaine were higher at 250 \u00b5m ablative depth, and the peak levels of MEGX were higher at all ablative depths tested. These findings suggest that laser treatment can increase the transdermal delivery of lidocaine and may be a useful method for enhancing"}
{"answers": "Vaccines were exposed to temperatures that may reduce their potency. Safe storage of vaccines in the clinics cannot be ensured without adhering to the recommended guidelines. Provision of adequate equipment and training for staff in maintaining the \"cold chain\" and the use and care of equipment are important components of a successful immunisation programme.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that there was a weak link in the cold chain for the storage of vaccines in the community. Only a minority of general practices and child health clinics were aware of the appropriate storage conditions for vaccines, and many were not monitoring the temperature of their refrigerators properly. This suggests that there may be a risk of vaccine spoilage or contamination, which could compromise their effectiveness."}
{"answers": "p53 alteration detected by IHC or SSCP analysis is not a clinically useful predictor of local response to pre-operative adjuvant therapy in advanced rectal carcinoma.", "prediction_text": "No, p53 alterations cannot be used to predict tumour response to pre-operative chemo-radiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer. The study found no significant differences in tumour size reduction or local failure between the groups with p53 overexpression or p53 mutation compared to normal."}
{"answers": "The results of this study cast doubt on the suggested advantage of HBO in reducing patient mortality and morbidity when used as adjuvant therapy for NF.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) therapy may be beneficial in improving patient mortality and outcome in patients with necrotizing fasciitis (NF). The mortality rate was higher in the group that did not receive HBO, with a significant difference in the mean number of surgical d\u00e9bridements required per patient. However, the study has limitations and the results should be interpreted with caution. Further studies with larger sample sizes and controlled designs are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "High doses of ZNS are effective and safe in pharmacoresistant epileptic patients. Therapeutic drug monitoring of ZNS may be considered at therapeutic failure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, high doses of zonisamide (>500 mg/d) may be effective and well-tolerated in adult patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy, with a response rate of 55% and good tolerance to other antiepileptic drugs in the majority of patients. However, the study had a small sample size and further larger-scale studies are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "In conclusion, high Ki-67 expression was associated with poor survival in patients with UTUC, as well as a high risk of disease progression, although these findings need to be interpreted with caution. Large-scale, adequately designed, prospective trials are needed to further confirm the value of Ki-67 in prognosis of UTUC patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, overexpression of Ki-67 is a prognostic biomarker of upper tract urinary carcinoma (UTUC). The study found that high Ki-67 expression was associated with aggressive tumor features, poor cancer-specific survival, and disease-free survival in UTUC patients. The meta-analysis of the published literature also confirmed these findings, showing that increased Ki-67 levels were associated with poor survival and disease progression in UTUC patients."}
{"answers": "After comparing MR with arthroscopic findings and reviewing the available literature, we conclude that arthroscopy permits the direct visualization of even fine articular surface changes but does not depict the subchondral bone, the most frequent site of injury detected with MRI. MRI was a very useful tool in the detection and characterization of the different types of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries and showed a statistically significant correlation between site and distribution of bone and cartilage injuries and between internal damage and trauma mechanisms. Therefore, we believe that MRI can help avoid diagnostic arthroscopy in the patients with a history of post-traumatic pain, acute articular blocks and negative radiographic findings.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used as an alternative to arthroscopy for the detection and characterization of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries in the knee, particularly in cases where the injury is located in the lateral compartment or the knee cap. However, the study also notes that arthroscopy remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of these injuries, particularly in cases where the injury is located in the medial compartment or where there is associated meniscal or ligament damage."}
{"answers": "The prevalence of cognitive impairment in MND in this population based study of an unselected cohort was higher than has been previously reported. Language deficits, especially anomia, may be relatively frequent in the MND population. Aphasia in MND may be masked by dysarthria and missed if not specifically examined.", "prediction_text": "Yes, dementia and aphasia are underrecognized associations in motor neuron disease. The study found that 28% of patients with motor neuron disease had significant cognitive deficits, including dementia and aphasia."}
{"answers": "Postoperative numbness occurs in most patients receiving nasal microfat injections. Partial to complete recovery of nasal tip sensation can be expected to occur over a 3-month period.", "prediction_text": "Yes, sensation gradually returns to the nasal tip after microfat grafting, with a mean recovery time of 12 weeks."}
{"answers": "Conveyance of emotions or movements through music may be decoded differently by persons with different types of communication disorders. Because music is the primary therapeutic tool in music therapy sessions, clinicians should consider these differential abilities when selecting music for clinical interventions focusing on emotions or movement.", "prediction_text": "Yes, communication disorders can extend to musical messages, as the study found that children with severe to profound hearing loss (using cochlear implants) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) had difficulty recognizing symbolic representation of emotions or movements in music, compared to children with typical development and normal hearing. The study suggests that individuals with communication disorders may have difficulty processing and interpreting musical messages, which can impact music therapy interventions."}
{"answers": "For some patients, using colour to describe their pain experience may be a useful tool to improve doctor-patient communication.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patients with knee osteoarthritis can use colour to describe their pain, with the majority associating high-intensity pain with red and low-intensity pain with colours such as purity, calmness, and happiness. However, there were some limitations and concerns raised regarding the interpretability and standardization of colour use for pain description."}
{"answers": "It appears safe to administer intensive chemotherapy regimens at standard doses to rural patients without increased morbidity or mortality. Support for general practitioners through phone or videoconferencing may reduce the safety concerns.", "prediction_text": "The study found that intensive chemotherapy is safe for rural cancer patients, with similar rates of serious adverse events and dose intensities between urban and rural patients at the Townsville Cancer Centre."}
{"answers": "Although outcomes for EPSCC remains poor, both surgery and radiation is shown to significantly improve median, 5- and 10-year survival rates. EPSCC patients who are potential candidates for surgical resection or radiation therapy may benefit from these treatments.", "prediction_text": "Yes, surgery and radiation therapy have a significant impact on survival for patients with extrapulmonary small cell cancers. Specifically, patients with gastrointestinal and genitourinary EPSCC had improved median, 5- and 10-year survival with surgery and/or radiation therapy for all stages and sizes. Multivariate analysis revealed age, gender, stage, radiation, and surgery to be independent predictors of survival for all EPSCCs."}
{"answers": "DGE after PPPD seems to be of minor clinical importance following uncomplicated surgery. When taking the results into consideration, it can be said that, despite the lack of a control group, antecolic duodenojejunostomy might be the key to a low incidence of DGE after PPPD. In our experience, DGE is linked to the occurrence of other postoperative complications rather than to pylorus preservation.", "prediction_text": "No, the incidence of delayed gastric emptying (DGE) after pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD) is not significantly related to the preservation of the pylorus. The study found that the overall incidence of DGE was 12% in the entire group, with 3% of patients experiencing DGE in the group where no postoperative complications other than DGE occurred, and 30% of patients experiencing DGE in the group where postoperative complications other than DGE occurred (P=0.002)."}
{"answers": "In women with POP, the symptom of pelvic pain is associated with the presence of defecatory symptoms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, pelvic pain is significantly associated with defecatory symptoms in women with pelvic organ prolapse (POP). Women with pelvic pain are more likely to experience straining with bowel movement, sense of incomplete emptying, pain with bowel movement, and splinting with bowel movement compared to those without pelvic pain."}
{"answers": "The results confirm that c-kit is vastly expressed in uveal melanoma, suggest that the c-kit molecular pathway may be important in uveal melanoma growth, and point to its use as a target for therapy with STI571.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that c-Kit-dependent growth of uveal melanoma cells may be a potential therapeutic target. The study found that c-Kit is strongly expressed and tyrosine phosphorylated in cultured uveal melanoma cells, and that treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 resulted in cell death. The IC(50) of the inhibitory effects on c-Kit phosphorylation and cell proliferation was found to be less than 2.5 microM, indicating a relatively high potency of STI571 in inhibiting c-Kit-dependent growth of uveal mel"}
{"answers": "Results suggest that telmisartan may reduce type-I diabetes mellitus-induced hepatic injury by suppressing activated hepatic stellate cells through concomitant TGF-beta1 down-regulation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, telmisartan prevents hepatic fibrosis in rats with alloxan-induced diabetes. The study found a significant difference in the numerical density of hepatocytes between the diabetic control group and the diabetic rats treated with telmisartan, suggesting that telmisartan has a protective effect on the liver. Additionally, the study found no immunoreactivity for TGF-beta in the liver sections of the diabetic rats treated with telmisartan, indicating that telmisartan may inhibit the production of TGF-beta, a protein involved in hepatic fibrosis."}
{"answers": "The great majority of U.S. renal transplant centers will not transplant kidneys to HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease, even if their infection is asymptomatic. However, advances in the management of HIV infection and a review of relevant ethical issues suggest that this approach should be reconsidered.", "prediction_text": "According to the survey, the majority of U.S. transplant centers (84%) would not transplant a kidney into an asymptomatic HIV-infected patient who refuses HIV testing, and only a few centers (4%) would consider transplanting an HIV-infected patient. Therefore, the answer to the question is yes, most centers still exclude HIV-infected patients from transplantation."}
{"answers": "The overall yield of SL for HCC was 7 %, and the accuracy was 27 %. When accurate imaging methods are available and additional percutaneous liver biopsy is implemented as a standard procedure in the preoperative workup of patients with HCC, the benefit of SL will become even less.", "prediction_text": "The study found that staging laparoscopy (SL) for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not very useful in determining the resectability of the tumor, with a yield of only 7% and an accuracy of 27%. However, the biopsy of the non-tumorous liver can provide valuable information on fibrosis/cirrhosis, leading to changes in management for 17% of patients."}
{"answers": "Expert breast pathology assessments continue to be necessary in the management of DCIS.", "prediction_text": "Yes, expert breast pathology assessment is necessary for the management of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The study found that inter-observer variability in pathologic reporting of DCIS was significant, and that secondary pathology assessments led to changes in risk assessment and treatment recommendations in a significant number of cases. Expert breast pathology assessment can help improve the accuracy and completeness of pathologic reporting of DCIS, leading to better management of these patients."}
{"answers": "Vaginal pH should be measured by bringing the pH strip in direct contact with fresh vaginal fluid without first adding saline.", "prediction_text": "No, vaginal pH cannot be accurately measured from the wet mount slide due to systematic increases in pH caused by the addition of saline, leading to false positive readings."}
{"answers": "This study presents a different clinical picture of oral mucoceles/ranulas, as observed in HIV-positive patients. Additionally, it suggests a possible clinical link between the two pathologies. The authors strongly support the suggestion that oral mucocele/ranula is an HIV-related salivary gland disease.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that oral mucocele/ranula is another HIV-related salivary gland disease, with a higher incidence among HIV-positive patients compared to HIV-negative patients."}
{"answers": "There are no data to support the widespread practice of using central venous pressure to guide fluid therapy. This approach to fluid resuscitation should be abandoned.", "prediction_text": "The meta-analysis found that the central venous pressure does not predict fluid responsiveness with a high degree of accuracy. The summary area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.56, indicating that the central venous pressure has a limited ability to identify fluid responders. The correlation coefficient between the baseline central venous pressure and change in stroke volume index/cardiac index was 0.18, which suggests a weak relationship between the two variables. The results were similar when the analysis was subgrouped by location (ICU or operating room). Therefore, central venous pressure should not be relied upon as the sole indicator for fluid management decisions."}
{"answers": "Increased D-dimer levels should not be considered as a diagnostic parameter in diagnosis of acute appendicitis.", "prediction_text": "No, D-dimer cannot become a new diagnostic parameter for acute appendicitis based on the study results. The study found no statistically significant difference in D-dimer levels between histopathologic study groups, and the ratio of cases with a number of leukocytes below the upper limit was also not significantly different."}
{"answers": "Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mitochondria play a role in remodeling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death (PCD). The study found that mitochondrial dynamics, including distribution, motility, and membrane potential, change during PCD in the lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis). The mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) formation is also involved in PCD, as inhibition of PTP by cyclosporine A (CsA) resulted in fewer perforations in the leaves. These findings suggest that mitochondria play a significant role in the remodeling of lace plant leaves during PCD."}
{"answers": "Our study emphasised the discomfort of transurethral urinary catheters, especially in male patients, and the high incidence of urinary tract infections in both sexes. Consideration should be given to the utilisation of alternative methods of bladder drainage, such as suprapubic catheterisation, which can be performed with ease during laparotomy.", "prediction_text": "No, transurethral catheterization is not the ideal method of bladder drainage based on the study's findings. Male patients were more dissatisfied with the procedure and experienced more pain during catheterization and removal, and a higher incidence of urinary tract infections compared to female patients."}
{"answers": "Based on this pilot data, MASCC score appears promising in determining suitability for outpatient management of NF in gynecologic oncology patients. Prospective study is ongoing to confirm safety and determine impact on cost.", "prediction_text": "Yes, risk stratification is useful for inpatient versus outpatient management of neutropenic fever in gynecologic oncology patients. In this study, patients who were considered high risk based on the MASCC score were more likely to experience severe complications, ICU admission, overall mortality, and death due to neutropenic fever. The MASCC score had a positive predictive value of 50% and negative predictive value of 90%."}
{"answers": "Halofantrine has mild to moderate pathological effects on cochlea histology, and can be considered an ototoxic drug.", "prediction_text": "Yes, halofantrine is ototoxic. The study found that halofantrine caused loss and distortion of inner hair cells, inner phalangeal cells, and spiral ganglia cells in guinea pigs."}
{"answers": "Proportionally fewer elderly patients with OPSCC are being treated than younger individuals. These patients can have significant benefits from aggressive treatments despite their older age as shown by our survival analysis. We recommend the use of objective measures to assess patient fitness to reduce the potential for undertreatment in the elderly population.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that elderly patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) are undertreated, particularly those aged 65-74 and 75-84 years old. The study found that these older age groups had a significant benefit in disease-specific survival (DSS) with surgery, radiation, or combined therapy compared to younger age groups. However, multivariate analysis did not show a statistically significant difference in the hazard ratios for combined treatment among the different age groups."}
{"answers": "Minimal access surgery for the repair of esophageal atresia or congenital diaphragmatic hernia is not associated with less cumulative opioid doses.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that there was no significant difference in opioid consumption between neonates undergoing thoracoscopic minimal access surgery (MAS) and conventional surgery for esophageal atresia (EA) or congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). The study found similar cumulative opioid doses at 12, 24, 48 hours and 7 days postoperatively between the two groups."}
{"answers": "Clinical predictors appear inadequate for the evaluation of the cervical spine in geriatric trauma patients with low-energy mechanism.", "prediction_text": "No, clinical predictors are not adequate in identifying cervical spine fractures in geriatric blunt trauma patients with low-energy mechanism."}
{"answers": "European individuals with type 1 diabetes consume a high atherogenic diet as few patients met recommendations for dietary fibre and saturated fat. This study showed minor changes in dietary nutrients and energy intakes over a period of 7 years. Nutrition education needs particular focus on strategies to increase dietary fibre and reduce saturated fat to exploit their potential benefit.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that the nutrient intake of European individuals with type 1 diabetes did not significantly change over a 7-year period, and they did not consume a high atherogenic diet. In fact, there were minor changes in the intake of protein, fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol, with some improvements in the intake of carbohydrates and fibre. However, the intake of saturated fat and fibre still fell short of the recommended levels."}
{"answers": "The gaps in patella eversion demonstrated smaller gaps both in knee extension and flexion position compared to the gaps of patella reduction position. The amount of decreased gaps was more definite in knee flexion position. Therefore, the intraoperative patellar positioning has influence on the measurement of the joint gap. Keeping the patella in reduced position is important during gap balancing.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patella position significantly influences ligament balancing in total knee arthroplasty. The study found that the gaps in patella eversion were smaller than those in patella reduction in both knee extension and flexion positions, with a more definite decrease in gaps in knee flexion position. Additionally, there was significant variability in knee flexion position, with 24% of knees with patella subluxation and 66% of knees with patella eversion demonstrating either increased or decreased gaps in knee flexion position compared to the gaps of patella reduction position. These findings suggest that patella position should be taken into account during"}
{"answers": "We have thus provided compelling evidence that there is a mossy fiber GABAergic signal. The physiologic role of this mossy fiber GABAergic signal is uncertain, but may be of developmental importance. Other evidence suggests that this GABAergic signal is transiently upregulated after seizures. This could have an inhibitory or disinhibitory effect, and further work is needed to elucidate its actual role.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mossy fibers release GABA. The study you mentioned found that mossy fiber terminals show intense immunoreactivity for GABA and GAD67, and electrical stimuli that recruit dentate granule cells elicit monosynaptic GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic signals in CA3 pyramidal neurons."}
{"answers": "Men and women in this community sample reported similar patterns of depressive symptoms. No evidence that the presentation of depressive symptoms differs by gender was found.", "prediction_text": "No, there were no significant gender differences in the self-report of depression symptoms even after adjusting for other covariates."}
{"answers": "Time to primary treatment after a diagnosis of breast cancer had no impact on overall survival. Further studies on care before diagnosis are important in drawing up meaningful quality indicators.", "prediction_text": "No, delays in time to primary treatment after a diagnosis of breast cancer do not significantly impact survival, according to the study."}
{"answers": "Our findings reveal a significant decrease in ADMA levels of ex-ELBW subjects compared to C, underlining a probable correlation with preterm birth and low birth weight. Taken together, these results may underlie the onset of early circulatory dysfunction predictive of increased cardiovascular risk.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that young adults born preterm at extremely low birth weights (<1000 g) had significantly lower levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) compared to healthy adults born at term, and that lower ADMA levels were associated with lower gestational age and birth weight at birth. These findings suggest that ADMA levels in young adults born preterm may predict early endothelial dysfunction."}
{"answers": "ECL assays improved the ability to predict time to diabetes in these autoantibody-positive relatives at risk for developing diabetes. These findings might be helpful in the design and eligibility criteria for prevention trials in the future.", "prediction_text": "Yes, electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assays can improve the prediction of time to type 1 diabetes in autoantibody-positive TrialNet subjects. ECL-positive subjects had a significantly higher risk of developing diabetes within 6 years compared to ECL-negative subjects, and adding ECL to the Diabetes Prevention Trial risk score improved the accuracy of prediction."}
{"answers": "These findings indicate that a relationship between multiple sclerosis and streptococcal infections may exist, but to acquire a better understanding of the role of group A streptococci in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, more studies with animal models are necessary.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant relationship between streptococcal infection and multiple sclerosis, as patients with MS had higher levels of antideoxyribonuclease B (ADNase B) compared to healthy controls."}
{"answers": "Aplastic anemia is associated with a variety of autoimmune syndromes. The sequence of events in our patient suggests that the hepatic failure, AFOP, and the VSAA may all have been part of an autoimmune syndrome. AFOP could be the result of immune dysregulation in this pediatric case with favorable outcome after immunosuppressive therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP) in children is believed to be an immune-mediated disorder. The case report in the medical paper you provided suggests that the patient's development of AFOP was associated with very severe aplastic anemia (VSAA), which is also an immune-mediated disorder. The use of immunosuppressive therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the treatment of the patient's VSAA and AFOP suggests that the immune system plays a key role in the pathogenesis of these conditions."}
{"answers": "Rescue AC may apply to only 18% of cases, and we identified subsets of more likely candidates.", "prediction_text": "The study found that only 17.9% of women remained pregnant for more than one week after receiving antenatal corticosteroids, and that those who delivered within two weeks of receiving the medication were more likely to deliver at less than 34 weeks of gestation. The study suggests that there may be a limited window of opportunity for rescue corticosteroid administration to improve fetal maturity."}
{"answers": "The results show that fatigue in patients with pSS and sSS is not due to the coexistence of FM in most cases. A lower incidence in the United Kingdom of FM in patients with pSS was found than has been previously reported.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant link between fatigue and fibromyalgia (FM) in patients with primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (pSS). The prevalence of fatigue is significantly higher in patients with pSS compared to those with lupus, and a higher proportion of patients with pSS also have FM."}
{"answers": "UDR provides an objective measurement of VUR and appears as a predictive tool of success after endoscopic injection.", "prediction_text": "Yes, distal ureteral diameter (UD) can predict reflux resolution after endoscopic injection in children with primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). In this study, the UD and the UD ratio (UDR) were significant predictors of reflux resolution on logistic regression analysis."}
{"answers": ": Data from both association and expression studies suggested that variants at HINT1 may be associated with schizophrenia and the associations may be sex-specific. However, the markers showing associations were in high LD to the SPEC2/PDZ-GEF2/ACSL6 locus reported previously in the same samples. This made it difficult to separate the association signals amongst these genes. Other independent studies may be necessary to distinguish these candidate genes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1) gene has been identified as a candidate gene for schizophrenia in several studies. The gene is located on chromosome 5q31.2, which is a region that has been implicated in the disorder. The study found nominally significant differences in allele frequencies in several SNPs around the HINT1 gene region in both the Irish study of high density schizophrenia families (ISHDSF) and the Irish case control study of schizophrenia (ICCSS), with significant interactions amongst sex, diagnosis, and rs3864283 genotypes in"}
{"answers": "Out of the four sacral sparing criteria, the acute phase anal sensory score measurements do not contribute significantly to the prognosis of independent ambulation. The combination of the acute phase voluntary anal contraction and the S4-5 LT and PP scores, predicts significantly better chronic phase-independent ambulation outcomes than the currently used distinction between complete and incomplete SCI.", "prediction_text": "No, the determination between complete and incomplete traumatic spinal cord injury is not clinically relevant for predicting independent ambulation at 1 year post-injury. The use of a combination of voluntary anal contraction and sensory scores (S4-5 LT and PP) has better discriminating power in predicting independent ambulation than the current distinction between complete and incomplete spinal cord injury."}
{"answers": "These findings suggest that schizophrenia is associated with progressive structural brain abnormalities, affecting both gray and white matter. We found no evidence to suggest progressive medial temporal lobe involvement but did find evidence that this may be partly explained by heterogeneity between studies in patient age and illness duration. The causes and clinical correlates of these progressive brain changes should now be the focus of investigation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there are progressive brain changes in schizophrenia, with significant decreases in volume over time in various brain regions, including the whole brain, frontal gray and white matter, parietal white matter, and temporal white matter, as well as increases in lateral ventricular volume. These changes are consistent with the progression of the disease."}
{"answers": "The elevated risk of death after CABG surgery known previously to be associated with CDM seems also to be shared by a group of similar size that includes patients with IFG and undiagnosed DM.", "prediction_text": "Yes, even impaired fasting blood glucose levels (IFG) below the diagnostic threshold for diabetes mellitus (DM) are associated with increased mortality after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. The relative risks of 30-day and 1-year mortality compared to patients with normal fasting blood glucose levels were 1.7 and 2.9, respectively, for patients with IFG."}
{"answers": "This is the first known report of concurrent plasma and ISF concentrations of a meropenem antibiotic during CVVHDF. We observed that the ISF concentrations of meropenem were significantly lower than the plasma concentrations, although the present dose was appropriate for infections caused by intermediately susceptible pathogens (MIC\u22644 mg/L).", "prediction_text": "Yes, meropenem concentrations in interstitial fluid (ISF) are equivalent to plasma concentrations in critically ill patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). The study found that ISF concentrations of meropenem were comparable to plasma concentrations, with a median ISF-to-plasma ratio of 63% (range 60-69%) during Profile A and 69% (65-74%) during Profile B. These findings suggest that ISF concentrations can be used as a surrogate for plasma concentrations in these patients."}
{"answers": "Despite advances in early diagnosis and surgical technique, 5-year survival of stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma remains low as compared to survival of other solid organ neoplasm. Tumour size<or=3cm, adenocarcinoma histologic type and negative bronchial resection margins were associated with a more favourable outcome in our patient population. More effective multimodality treatments are needed to increase survival rates.", "prediction_text": "The prognostic significance of various surgical-pathologic variables in patients with Stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) was investigated in the study. The results suggest that histology (adenocarcinoma vs squamous cell carcinoma), tumor size (<3cm vs >3cm), and the presence of a negative resection margin are significant prognostic factors for overall 5-year survival. However, the survival difference between T1N0 and T2N0 disease was not statistically significant. Therefore, while Stage I NSCLC may seem like an early stage, the prognosis can vary depending on various factors, and careful evaluation of these"}
{"answers": "There is a knowledge deficit regarding the SU treatment goal among gout patients receiving ULT, despite generally high levels of other gout-specific knowledge. SU goal information may be an important and underutilized concept among providers treating gout patients.", "prediction_text": "Only 14% of gout patients knew their target serum urate (SU) goal, despite the central role of achieving and maintaining the SU goal with urate-lowering therapy (ULT). Having a rheumatologist as the initial prescriber and knowing other gout-specific knowledge questions were associated with greater odds of knowing the SU goal. SU goal knowledge was associated with better global health status, but not with self-reported health-related quality of life or gout-specific health status."}
{"answers": "Despite government assistance, low-income individuals use vision care services less often than wealthy individuals.", "prediction_text": "Yes, government-funded low-income vision care programs in Canada improve utilization of eye care services by low-income individuals, particularly among those with financial difficulty. The study found that individuals who received financial assistance were more likely to utilize eye care providers compared to those who did not receive assistance. The prevalence ratio for utilization of eye care providers was 0.68 (95% CI 0.57-0.80) among those with financial difficulty compared to those without."}
{"answers": "Premature births from rural mothers have a higher risk of stillbirth and mortality in neonatal intensive care than urban infants.", "prediction_text": "Yes, rural residence is associated with poorer outcomes in premature infants, including higher mortality and stillbirth rates, compared to urban residence in the state of New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory."}
{"answers": "Altered ET-1 levels may be involved in the pathogenesis of rebound hypertension and hypotension during HD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a role for endothelin-1 (ET-1) in the hemodynamic changes during hemodialysis (HD). Intradialytic changes in ET-1 levels were found to be associated with the development of hypotension and rebound hypertension during HD. Specifically, post-dialysis ET-1 levels were significantly lower in patients who experienced stable intradialytic hemodynamics (group I) compared to those who developed hypotension (group II) or rebound hypertension (group III). These findings suggest that ET-1 may play a role in the pathogenesis of hemodynamic changes during HD."}
{"answers": "While FS was commonly used in patients undergoing thyroidectomy at our institution, in no patient over the last decade did FS correctly alter the intraoperative management. Given the time required to perform FS and the cost associated with it, we believe that routine FS should not be performed in these patients.", "prediction_text": "No, frozen section analysis did not alter the intraoperative management of multinodular thyroid disease in the study population."}
{"answers": "Elderly patients have informational and relational needs similar to those of younger patients. In fact, most of the whole sample flagged up the need for higher levels of satisfaction especially concerning a better dialogue with health staff, along with a new factor: the need to talk to people with the same illness.", "prediction_text": "Yes, elderly cancer patients have different care needs compared with younger ones. The study found that older patients were more likely to request financial-insurance information, the need to talk to people with the same illness, and the need for a better dialogue with clinicians. Few significant differences were found between the two age subgroups, with the exception of issues such as the need for intimacy and support."}
{"answers": "According to the results of our study and the data from the international literature, the entity globulomaxillary cyst is no longer justified.", "prediction_text": "The term \"globulomaxillary cyst\" is no longer considered a valid diagnostic entity, as it has been absorbed into other cystic lesions in the region. However, cystic lesions in the nasal and maxillary region still occur and can be diagnosed as lateral periodontal cysts, radicular cysts, keratocystic odontogenic tumors, adenomatoid odontogenic tumors, periapical granulomas, residual cysts, or undefined jaw cysts. The study aims to clarify the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures for these cystic lesions."}
{"answers": "Although components of the CSM (cognitive and emotional representations, coping strategies) were associated with fears of recurrence, optimism was found to be the strongest predictor of fear, independent of anxiety and level of fear reported prior to treatment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, according to the study, pre-treatment fears and optimism can predict long-term fears of recurrence in head and neck cancer survivors."}
{"answers": "Older adults enrolled in PICT with more symptoms may sacrifice QOL for experimental treatment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, symptoms do matter when considering patients for phase I clinical trials in older adults with advanced cancer. Older adults with more symptoms had more admissions, complications, and greater decline in functional status compared to those with fewer symptoms."}
{"answers": "Effective CPAP treatment in IPF patients with OSA results in a significant improvement in daily living activities based on the FOSQ, namely an OSA-specific follow-up instrument. Improvement was also noted in other questionnaires assessing quality of life, though not to a statistically significant degree, probably because of the multifactorial influences of IPF on physical and mental health. The probability of poor CPAP compliance was high and could only be eliminated with intense follow-up by the CPAP clinic staff.", "prediction_text": "Yes, CPAP therapy offers a significant improvement in sleep quality and overall life quality parameters in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The study found a statistically significant improvement in the Functional Outcomes in Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ) at 1, 3, and 6 months after CPAP initiation. Additionally, improvement was noted in the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores, although these changes were not statistically significant. However, two patients had difficulty complying with CPAP and"}
{"answers": "Income support policy may be a significant new lever for improving population health, especially that of lower-income persons. Even though the findings are robust, further analyses are needed to confirm their reliability. Future research should examine a variety of different income support policies, as well as whether a broader range of social and economic policies affect health.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program is found to reduce disability in the elderly. An increase of $100 per month in the maximum SSI benefit was associated with a 0.46 percentage point decrease in mobility limitations among single elderly individuals. The findings were robust to various sensitivity analyses, including limiting the analysis to subgroups more likely to receive SSI, using different disability measures, and controlling for potential confounders such as Medicaid coverage."}
{"answers": "None of the clinical identifiers for early-stage adhesive capsulitis previously proposed by expert consensus have been validated in this study. Clinicians should be aware that commonly used clinical identifiers may not be applicable to this stage.", "prediction_text": "The study found that only pain at the end of range of all measured active movements was associated with a positive anesthetic response (PAR) in early-stage primary/idiopathic adhesive capsulitis. The other proposed identifiers were not found to be significantly associated with a PAR."}
{"answers": "Despite current recommendations, cough and cold medicines are still used in children younger than 6 years of age. A significant portion of caregivers report that they are still unaware of public warnings, potential side effects, and interactions with other medications.", "prediction_text": "Yes, concerns about the use of cold preparations in young children still exist, as 82% of caregivers in the study stated that they would treat their children with cough or cold medicines, and 72% of them incorrectly dosed the medication they desired to give."}
{"answers": "Vitamin C reduces the prevalence of complex regional pain syndrome after wrist fractures. A daily dose of 500 mg for fifty days is recommended.", "prediction_text": "Yes, vitamin C can prevent complex regional pain syndrome in patients with wrist fractures. The study found that patients who received vitamin C had a significantly lower prevalence of complex regional pain syndrome compared to those who received a placebo, with the highest effect observed in the 1500 mg dose group. Early cast-related complaints were also found to be a predictor of complex regional pain syndrome."}
{"answers": "The tendency to clear one's plate when eating is associated with increased body weight and may constitute a risk factor for weight gain.", "prediction_text": "Yes, plate clearing is associated with increased body weight in a cohort of US adults."}
{"answers": "ACS is common in patients with SCD who present with fever and was grossly underestimated by evaluating physicians. History and physical examination appear to be of little value in defining which febrile patients require CXR. In view of the mortality and morbidity associated with ACS, empiric CXR should be considered when evaluating a febrile patient with SCD.", "prediction_text": "No, clinician assessment for acute chest syndrome (ACS) in febrile patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) is not accurate enough. The study found that only 39% of physicians were able to accurately diagnose ACS based on clinical evaluation, and even completely normal physical examination findings were seen in 57% of patients with ACS."}
{"answers": "We conclude that the quality of rectal cancer excision, as defined by mesorectal grades, achieved by supervised colorectal trainees is comparable with that achieved by consultants.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no significant difference in the quality of mesorectal excision between supervised colorectal trainees and consultants, as measured by mesorectal grades."}
{"answers": "Dutch primary schools could play a more important role in fostering healthy eating habits among children. The school food policy could be improved by clearly formulating food rules, simplifying supervision of the food rules, and defining how to enforce the food rules. In addition, the school food policy will only influence children's dietary behaviour if both the school and the parents support the policy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is room for improvement in the school food policy at Dutch primary schools. While most schools have a written food policy, the rules are not always clearly defined, and there is a lack of parental involvement in enforcing the policy. Parents believe that both the school and parents have a responsibility in fostering healthy eating habits among children, but there is variation in opinions on the enforcement of the policy."}
{"answers": "Speed discrimination, per se, is not impaired in schizophrenia patients. The observed abnormality appears to be a consequence of impairment in generating or integrating the feedback information from eye movements. This study introduces a novel approach to motion perception studies and highlights the importance of concurrently measuring eye movements to understand interactions between these two systems; the results argue for a conceptual revision regarding motion perception abnormality in schizophrenia.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the motion perception deficit in schizophrenia is not solely a consequence of eye-tracking abnormality. While eye-tracking difficulties are present in schizophrenia patients, the motion perception deficit may be due to other factors as well."}
{"answers": "(1) There is little overlap between regions of CFAEs during AF and regions of SRF measured in the time domain or the frequency domain, (2) the majority of SRF appears to occur in regions with wave-front collision, (3) the distribution of SRF is similar in patients with AF and normal controls, suggesting that this may not have an important role in AF maintenance and may not be a suitable ablation target.", "prediction_text": "There is no significant correlation between complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAEs) recorded during atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm fractionation (SRF) in the left atrium. The two types of electrograms do not overlap significantly in terms of their distribution across the left atrial surface area."}
{"answers": "Continence function remained undisturbed after anastomotic leakage due to rectal resection", "prediction_text": "Yes, anastomotic leakage after rectal resection for cancer is associated with a worse functional outcome, as measured by the Cleveland Clinic Continence Score, although the difference was not statistically significant."}
{"answers": "No evidence was found for OPLL to have any effect on the initial neurologic status or recovery in motor function after traumatic cervical cord injury, suggesting that the neurologic outcome is not significantly dependent on canal space.", "prediction_text": "No, ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) does not significantly affect the neurological outcome after traumatic cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) in terms of motor function, as measured by the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment scale."}
{"answers": "Circumferences and related ratios scale significantly to height, notably after adjustment for age and race, across subjects who are representative of the US population. These observations have implications for the clinical and epidemiologic use of these anthropometric measures and indexes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, adult body circumferences (waist circumference (WC) and hip circumference (HC)) are associated with height in a non-linear manner. After adjusting for age, race, and self-reported health status, the study found that WC and HC scaled to height with powers of 0.76 \u00b1 0.08 and 0.45 \u00b1 0.05 in men, and 0.80 \u00b1 0.05 and 0.53 \u00b1 0.04 in women, respectively (all P<0.001). This means that for every one-centimeter increase in height, WC and H"}
{"answers": "We found evidence that pain can be a significant clinical problem in psychiatric patients which seems to be underestimated in psychiatry. The investigated patients in general adult psychiatry are characterized by specific risk factors different from clinical subpopulations of other disciplines.", "prediction_text": "Yes, pain is a clinically relevant problem in general adult psychiatry, with a high prevalence of pain complaints among psychiatric patients, particularly among those with affective disorders and those with a history of depression. The study found that nearly 50% of patients experienced pain in the past week, and over 75% experienced pain in the past 6 months and 12 months. The most common pain locations were the low back, headache, and shoulder and neck. The study also identified depression and number of past admissions to psychiatric hospitals as statistically significant risk factors for pain. These findings suggest that pain should be assessed and managed in all psychiatric"}
{"answers": "This study found that influences on coping were multifactorial and moderated by age. These factors have implications for interventions designed to enhance coping strategies.", "prediction_text": "Yes, age moderates the effect of personality disorder on coping style in psychiatric inpatients. Older adults with personality disorder reported lower levels of dysfunctional coping strategies than younger adults with personality disorder."}
{"answers": "The study data suggests a possible correlation between cervical discopathy and cervical MS plaque.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant relation between cervical cord plaques and discopathy in patients with multiple sclerosis. In this study, 69.1% of patients with cervical discopathy had cervical cord plaques at the same site."}
{"answers": "Higher MCVs and AST/ALT ratios in ASH reflect the severity of underlying liver disease and do not differentiate NASH from ASH. Instead, these biomarkers might prove useful in guiding selection of patients for liver biopsy and in targeting therapy.", "prediction_text": "Routine laboratory markers are not useful for differentiating nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) from alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH). The study found that the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) was elevated in ASH patients and normal in NASH patients, but this difference was not useful for differentiating between the two conditions. Other markers, such as the AST/ALT ratio and age, were found to be more useful in predicting high-grade fibrosis. However, the study suggests that the MCV may be more useful in differentiating between NASH and high-grade fibrosis."}
{"answers": "We found no evidence that IBR compromised the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy, although there was a significant incidence of implant infection.", "prediction_text": "No, immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) does not significantly compromise the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy."}
{"answers": "Economic inequalities in breast and cervical cancer screening are low in LMICs with high screening coverage. These findings are consistent with the inverse equity hypothesis and indicate that high levels of equity in cancer screening are feasible even in countries with high income inequality.", "prediction_text": "The inverse equity hypothesis does not apply to coverage of cancer screening in middle-income countries. In these countries, economic inequalities in screening participation were substantially lower or non-existent in countries with higher aggregate coverage."}
{"answers": "Post tonsillectomy antibiotics did not prove to have a role in minimizing postoperative morbidity. Moreover, analgesics given on the basis of as required had a limited value.", "prediction_text": "No, the use of postoperative antibiotics did not significantly decrease post-tonsillectomy morbidity in this study."}
{"answers": "The study findings suggest that adopting measurement-based care, such as using the PHQ-9, is achievable, even in practices with limited resources.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the systematic use of patient-rated depression severity monitoring through the Nine-Item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) is both helpful and feasible in clinical psychiatry. The study found that all 17 practices adopted the PHQ-9 as a routine part of depression care within a year, and that it influenced clinical decision making for 93% of patient contacts. The use of the PHQ-9 led to treatment changes in 40% of clinical contacts, with the most common changes being adjustments to antidepressant medication and the addition of psychotherapy. Additionally, the PHQ-9 led to additional suicide"}
{"answers": "There is no advantage to an intramedullary nail versus a sliding compression hip screw for low-energy pertrochanteric fractures AO/OTA 31-A1 and A2, specifically with its increased cost and lack of evidence to show decreased complications or improved patient outcome.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no significant advantage to using an intramedullary nail for the treatment of pertrochanteric fractures compared to a sliding compression hip screw, based on the results of this study."}
{"answers": "Just over half the patients in this present cohort may be physically able to undertake some aspects of self-managed foot care, including nail clipping and filing, callus filing and daily hygiene and inspection.", "prediction_text": "Only 57% of the rheumatoid arthritis patients in the study were physically able to participate in the FOOTSTEP self-management foot care program, as they failed one or more of the physical tests assessing sight, reach, and grip strength."}
{"answers": "The homogeneity we found in the deprivation-mortality relationship across the regions of Scotland and the absence of a contextualized effect of region highlights the importance of taking a broader strategic policy that can combat the toxic impacts of socio-economic deprivation on health. Focusing on a few specific places (e.g. 15% of the poorest areas) to concentrate resources might be a good start but the impact of socio-economic deprivation on mortality is not restricted to a few places. A comprehensive strategy that can be sustained over time might be needed to interrupt the linkages between poverty and mortality.", "prediction_text": "Yes, context matters for the relationship between deprivation and all-cause mortality. The study found that there are spatial variations in the relationship between deprivation and mortality, with areas in the West of Scotland having higher mortality rates than the rest of the country, even after controlling for deprivation levels. This suggests that local contextual factors may play a role in shaping the relationship between deprivation and mortality."}
{"answers": "This study adds to the growing body of literature documenting the importance of the individual therapist as an important factor in the change process.", "prediction_text": "The study found that approximately 12% of the variability in the outcome of cognitive processing therapy (CPT) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a Veterans Affairs (VA) specialty clinic was due to differences between therapists. The trainer identified several characteristics and actions of effective therapists, including effectively addressing patient avoidance, using flexible interpersonal style, and developing a strong therapeutic alliance. These findings suggest that while there may be some variability in the implementation of evidence-based treatments (EBTs) in practice, there are certain factors that can help to standardize EBTs and improve outcomes."}
{"answers": "New depression diagnosis and antidepressant use was shown to be less likely in areas of higher own-ethnic density for some, but not all, ethnic groups.", "prediction_text": "Yes, depression diagnosis and antidepressant prescribing vary by location. Compared to white British patients, black and minority ethnic groups are significantly less likely to be newly diagnosed with depression or prescribed antidepressants. Additionally, there is an inverse relationship between neighborhood ethnic density and new depression diagnosis for some groups, with a decrease in depression diagnosis for groups with higher proportions of their own ethnicity in the neighborhood. However, the opposite effect was found for black Caribbean patients."}
{"answers": "These findings suggest a malleable relationship between knee extensor strength, dynamic stability, and disease severity in PD. Although strength is only one piece of the puzzle in the functional outcome of PD, these findings may assist clinicians in designing appropriate interventions aimed at increasing function and decreasing fall risk in PD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, knee extensor strength, dynamic postural stability, and functional ambulation are related in Parkinson's disease. The study found a positive correlation between knee extensor strength and dynamic postural stability, and a negative correlation between knee extensor strength and disease severity. Additionally, dynamic postural stability was found to be negatively correlated with disease severity and positively correlated with functional ambulation."}
{"answers": "It is concluded that preloading colloid fluid prior to repositioning could prevent the decrease of systolic blood pressure and central venous pressure during sitting positioning without other complications.", "prediction_text": "Yes, preloading with colloids before positioning neurosurgical patients can prevent hemodynamic changes during seated positioning. The study found that systolic blood pressure and central venous pressure were maintained significantly better in the study group compared to the control group."}
{"answers": "Data from Safe Implementation of Treatments in Stroke-International Stroke Thrombolysis Register suggest that intravenous thrombolysis may modify the observed survival and recovery advantage for men expected in the natural course of an ischemic stroke, with a possible larger beneficial treatment effect in women when compared with men.", "prediction_text": "Yes, sex influences the response to intravenous thrombolysis in ischemic stroke. Men are more likely to have a better functional outcome and lower mortality rate after 3 months, while women are more likely to experience symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage and have a higher mortality rate."}
{"answers": "The rate of early infection without antibiotic prophylaxis before TIVAD placement in the interventional radiology suite is<1%. Based on these data, use of prophylactic antibiotics for TIVAD placement is not recommended.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, prophylactic antibiotics may not be necessary for totally implantable venous access device (TIVAD) placement by interventional radiologists, as there was no significant difference in the rate of early infection (CLABSI) between patients who received antibiotics incidental to the procedure and those who did not. However, the study did suggest that chemotherapy administration on the day of placement may increase the risk of early infection. Further research with larger sample sizes is needed to confirm these findings and establish the optimal antibiotic prophylaxis strategy for TIVAD placement."}
{"answers": "The PRP group recorded reduced pain, swelling, and trismus as well as enhanced and faster bone healing compared with those in the control. Hence the study showed that topical application of PRP gel has a beneficial effect in enhancing socket healing after third molar surgery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that the application of autologous platelet-rich plasma gel to the socket of mandibular third molars can enhance healing after surgical extraction. The study showed that the PRP group had lower postoperative pain scores compared to the control group, and similar results were observed for swelling and interincisal mouth opening. However, the differences were not statistically significant. The study also found that the PRP group had better scores for lamina dura, trabecular pattern, and bone density, but these differences were also not statistically significant."}
{"answers": "This study confirms that physicians often differ from patients in the assessment of QoL. This is most likely due to a difference in patient-physician perception of \"significant\" LUTS and clearly demonstrates the importance of patient evaluated QoL in routine clinical assessment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant discrepancy between patient and physician quality of life assessment in women with lower urinary tract dysfunction. The physician tended to underestimate the impact of symptoms on the patient's quality of life in 4 out of 9 domains, and overestimated it in 5 out of 9 domains."}
{"answers": "Left ventricular dimensions are not influenced by MetS. Rather than MetS, hypertension is primarily responsible for changes in left ventricular dimensions. However, left atrial enlargement is more prominent in patients with MetS, suggesting that each MetS criterion contributes to left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.", "prediction_text": "Yes, accompanying metabolic syndrome contributes to increased heart dimensions in hypertensive patients, specifically in terms of left atrial diameter."}
{"answers": "A higher PV in PMR increases the risk of prolonged steroid therapy and late GCA. Female sex and particular HLA alleles may increase the risk of late GCA. Starting patients on>15 mg prednisolone is associated with a prolonged steroid duration.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the prognosis of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) can be predicted at disease onset. In this study, baseline factors associated with the duration of steroid therapy included elevated plasma viscosity (PV) and starting treatment at >15 mg prednisolone. These factors were found to independently reduce the chances of stopping steroids within a given time interval. Additionally, female sex, HLA-DRB1*0101 or -*0401 alleles, and PV > 2.00 mPa s compared to PV < 1.80 mPa s were found to be predictors of late GCA"}
{"answers": "The study suggests that there is no difference in clinical toxicity profiles or survival outcomes with either definitive chemoradiotherapy or chemoradiation followed by surgery in management of locally advanced esophageal cancer.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that surgical resection may not be necessary for patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus who receive chemoradiotherapy. The addition of surgery to chemoradiotherapy did not improve overall survival or disease-free survival in this study. However, the study had limited sample size and follow-up time, so further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Our results give first evidence that lowered beta E during alcohol withdrawal may contribute to anxiety as a common disturbance during this state.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that withdrawal-induced anxiety in alcoholism is associated with beta-endorphin deficiency. The study found that plasma levels of beta-endorphin were significantly lower in alcoholics during acute alcohol withdrawal compared to controls, and that this deficiency was associated with increased anxiety levels. The correlation between beta-endorphin levels and anxiety was independent of the effects of the pituitary-adrenocortical hormone secretion. Additionally, the study found that the inverse relationship between beta-endorphin levels and craving was significant only on day 14 of withdrawal, suggesting that this association may be related to the development"}
{"answers": "Increased private health care activity does not reduce the demand for NHS care: NHS and private referral rates were positively associated with each other after adjusting for age, deprivation and practice.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that increased use of private healthcare does not reduce the demand for NHS care. In fact, the opposite is true: areas with higher private healthcare usage have higher NHS referral rates."}
{"answers": "Skewed X-inactivation is not associated with recurrent spontaneous abortion but is associated with increasing maternal age.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is an association between recurrent spontaneous abortion and skewed X-inactivation. The rate of extreme skewing (90% or greater) was higher in the recurrent spontaneous abortion population (8.6%) compared to other groups, with a statistically significant difference observed between the recurrent spontaneous abortion group and the primiparous group (1.0% vs 8.6%, P < 0.01). Additionally, the incidence of X-inactivation skewing of 90% or greater was no different whether there had been at least 1 live birth or no previous live births and at least 3 losses. However, subjects"}
{"answers": "Findings suggest that analgesic management of daily pain is better for nursing home residents enrolled in hospice than for those not enrolled in hospice.The prescribing practices portrayed by this study reveal that many dying nursing home residents in daily pain are receiving no analgesic treatment or are receiving analgesic treatment inconsistent with AMDA and other pain management guidelines. Improving the analgesic management of pain in nursing homes is essential if high-quality end-of-life care in nursing homes is to be achieved.", "prediction_text": "Yes, receipt of hospice care in nursing homes improves the management of pain at the end of life. Hospice residents were more likely to receive regular treatment for daily pain (51% vs 33%) and were twice as likely to receive adequate pain management (adjusted odds ratio = 2.08) compared to non-hospice residents."}
{"answers": "The continuity-of-care experiences of vascular trainees are suboptimal. This is especially true for postoperative clinic assessment. Same-day admission surgery accounted for most of the cases and was associated with the poorest continuity of care. To provide complete surgical training in an era of changing therapeutic modalities and same-day admission surgery, vascular programs must be creative in structuring training to include adequate ambulatory experience.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the continuity of care experience of residents in an academic vascular department was not optimal, with a low rate of complete in-hospital continuity of care (57%). Emergent cases were associated with a higher rate of preoperative assessment, while elective cases admitted before the day of surgery had higher rates of preoperative assessment and involvement in the decision to operate compared to same-day admission patients. The study suggests that trainees may not be learning complete surgical care."}
{"answers": "Simple detorsion was not accompanied by an increase in morbidity, and all patients studied had functioning ovarian tissue on follow-up despite the surgeon's assessment of the degree of ovarian ischemia. Detorsion is the procedure of choice for most cases of ovarian torsion in children.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that oophorectomy may not be necessary for all children with ovarian torsion, as many ovaries can be treated by detorsion alone. The study found that the median time from presentation to surgery was significantly lower in the detorsion group compared to the oophorectomy group, and postoperative complications and length of stay were similar between the two groups. Additionally, follow-up sonograms or ovarian biopsies showed normal ovary with follicular development in most cases where the ovary was judged intraoperatively as moderately to severely ischemic."}
{"answers": "Half-dose MR angiography using diluted contrast medium injected at a rate of 1 mL/second depicted the abdominal aorta and its branches as clearly as using a full single dose.", "prediction_text": "Half-dose contrast-enhanced three-dimensional MR angiography is sufficient for depicting the abdominal aorta and pelvis, with similar image quality compared to full-dose imaging."}
{"answers": "There was no evidence of a trend in unsafe sex behaviour over time. However, several subgroups were identified as being more likely to report unsafe sex and should be targeted for specific interventions.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no evidence of an increase in reported unsafe sexual behavior among HIV-infected individuals over time in the studied population."}
{"answers": "In normal clinical practice, chemotherapy significantly prolongs survival in patients with performance status of less than 2, more time being gained if there is no associated weight loss. We conclude that the reluctance shown by many pneumologists toward using this treatment is not entirely justified.", "prediction_text": "The study found that chemotherapy is an independent predictor of survival in patients with advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), and that patients with ECOG scores of 0 to 1 and absence of weight loss have better survival outcomes with cytostatic treatment. These findings suggest that chemotherapy can be beneficial in improving survival in this patient population, and that pneumologists' skepticism towards chemotherapy may be unwarranted."}
{"answers": "The Medicaid Demonstration in Florida appears to result in lower PMPM expenditures. Demonstration PSNs generated slightly greater reductions in expenditures compared to Demonstration HMOs. PSNs appear to be a promising model for delivering care to Medicaid enrollees.", "prediction_text": "Yes, provider service networks (PSNs) in Florida's Medicaid program resulted in lower per member per month (PMPM) expenditures compared to health maintenance organizations (HMOs) among both Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) enrollees, with PSNs lowering PMPM expenditures by $7 more than HMOs."}
{"answers": "In this series, in accordance to available testosterone, the prevalence of PADAM was determined to be high, in which the ADAM questionnaire rendered a low diagnostic efficiency. PADAM diagnosis could be clinically suspected when symptoms of sexual dysfunction are present.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the Androgen Deficiency of Aging Men (ADAM) questionnaire is useful for the screening of partial androgenic deficiency of aging men. The study found that the ADAM questionnaire had a sensitivity of 83.3% and specificity of 19.7% in detecting PADAM, and item 1 (decreased sexual desire) was a better predictor of hypogonadism than the complete questionnaire."}
{"answers": "We found that intrapartum VAS was an effective predictor of fetal acidosis in cases of FHR variable decelerations, but its predictability for fetal acidosis in cases of FHR late decelerations was limited. Both VAS and fetal blood pH are good predictors of neonatal morbidity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that intrapartum vibroacoustic stimulation (VAS) is an effective predictor of fetal acidosis during labor. The study showed that a negative response to VAS (no acceleration or decelerations) was associated with a low fetal blood pH (pH<7.20) in both term and preterm fetuses. The study also found that the positive predictive value of fetal acidosis was higher when VAS was used alone compared to when fetal heart rate (FHR) variable decelerations or late decelerations were used alone. The study concluded that VAS can be used as a useful predictor of fetal acidosis"}
{"answers": "Emergency US fellowship programs had a positive impact on residents' US educational experiences. Emergency medicine residents performed more scans overall and also used bedside US for more advanced applications in programs with EUS fellowships.", "prediction_text": "Yes, emergency ultrasound fellowship programs have a significant impact on emergency medicine residents' ultrasound education, with residents in programs with fellowships performing more scans and reporting more applications of bedside ultrasound compared to those in programs without fellowships."}
{"answers": "Obesity does not seem to impact the severity of injury, mortality rate, types of injury, and procedure outcomes in children. Obese patients are more likely to have rib and pelvic injuries.", "prediction_text": "Yes, obesity has a significant impact on the pattern and outcome of trauma in children. Obese children are more likely to have rib fractures and pelvic injuries, and have a higher injury severity score and lower pediatric trauma score, heart rate, and respiratory rate compared to non-obese children. However, there was no significant association between mortality and obesity."}
{"answers": "The laparoscopic-assisted approach to Crohn's disease is feasible and safe with good outcomes. Co-morbid preoperative findings such as abscess, phlegmon, or recurrent disease at the previous ileocolic anastomosis are not contraindications to a successful laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resection in select patients.", "prediction_text": "No, these factors are not contraindications to a successful laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resection. In fact, the study found that operative blood loss and time were greater in the group undergoing open surgery (group IV) compared to the laparoscopic groups (I, II, and III), and morbidity was highest in group IV. Additionally, length of hospital stay was longest in group IV. These findings suggest that laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resection can be a safe and effective option for patients with Crohn's disease, even in the presence of abscesses, phlegmons, or recurrent disease at"}
{"answers": "When controlling for preoperative features, the year in which RP was performed is a predictor of outcome on multivariate analysis. This effect could not be explained by stage migration.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the year of radical prostatectomy (RP) is a predictor of treatment outcome in prostate cancer, with better outcomes observed in patients undergoing surgery in the mid-1990s compared to earlier or later years."}
{"answers": "The menopausal transition warrants attention as a period of vulnerability to MDD recurrence, while health factors and VMS should be considered important risk factors for first lifetime-onset of MDD during midlife.", "prediction_text": "The study found that women without a prior history of major depression (MDD) had a lower risk of developing MDD during midlife compared to those with a prior history, and their risk profiles differed. Specifically, health conditions prior to baseline and during follow-ups, perception of functioning, and vasomotor symptoms (VMS) were risk factors for first lifetime-onset MDD, while being peri- and post-menopausal, psychological symptoms, and a prior anxiety disorder were predominant risk factors for MDD recurrence."}
{"answers": "Most children undergoing congenital heart surgery can be extubated in the operating room. Most neonates, including many undergoing complex procedures, can be extubated within the first 24 hours after surgery. Early extubation was associated with low morbidity rates and short lengths of intensive care unit and hospital stays.", "prediction_text": "Yes, early extubation (within 24 hours) should be the goal for children after congenital cardiac surgery. The study found that early extubation was associated with lower mortality and a lower rate of reintubation compared to delayed extubation. Additionally, the implementation of an early extubation strategy was associated with low rates of complications, short lengths of intensive care unit stay, and short hospital stays. The only procedure that did not have early extubation was Norwood operations, and the reasons for this are not specified in the study. Therefore, early extubation should be the goal for all children undergoing congenital heart surgery, including neonates."}
{"answers": "A significant association between farming and PSV has been identified for the first time. Results also support previously reported associations with silica, solvents, and allergy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, environmental factors are important in primary systemic vasculitis (PSV). The study found that farming in the index year and during working lifetime was significantly associated with PSV, as well as with specific subtypes of PSV, such as Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) and Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS). Additionally, high occupational exposure to silica, solvents, and metals, as well as drug allergy and overall allergy, were also associated with PSV. These findings suggest that environmental factors may play a role in the development of PSV, and that occupational and environmental exposures should be considered in the evaluation and management of patients with"}
{"answers": "This study that shows that adequate femoral tunnel lengths can be safely created without knee hyperflex - ion using flexible instruments via an anteromedial portal.", "prediction_text": "The study found that flexible instruments can create femoral tunnel lengths greater than 20 mm at 90\u00b0 of knee flexion, but there is a trend towards longer distances to the common peroneal nerve with increased flexion. The distance to the LCL did not show significant differences among the groups. However, there was a statistically significant difference in the distance to the common peroneal nerve between 70\u00b0 and 120\u00b0 of flexion. Therefore, it can be concluded that flexible instruments may not be able to create adequate femoral tunnel lengths at 90\u00b0 of knee flexion for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, especially in terms of preserving the"}
{"answers": "A proportionally longer treatment duration was identified as an adverse factor in low-risk patients. Treatment breaks resulting in a NTDR of>/=33% (e.g., four or more breaks during a 40-fraction treatment, 5 d/wk) should be avoided.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the elapsed treatment time for external beam radiotherapy (RT) for prostate cancer is detrimental to outcome, with a longer treatment time associated with a higher risk of biochemical failure (FFBF). The prognostive value of the non-treatment day ratio (NTDR) is significant in the low-risk group, but not in the intermediate-risk or high-risk groups."}
{"answers": "TEE allowed a diagnosis of site involvement that did correlate with the anatomic diagnosis obtained during the operation. This fact contributed to the management of patients and was of great help in guiding the surgical intervention. Echo-oriented single-valve replacement may be a safe strategy for patients with PVE and double prostheses.", "prediction_text": "Single-valve replacement in patients with double prostheses may not be safe, as 4 out of 13 patients who underwent this procedure died within a week after surgery. However, the study found that the positive predictive value of transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) for the preoperative diagnosis of the site of infection was 100%, suggesting that accurate diagnosis is possible."}
{"answers": "Acute hepatitis C in the post universal blood products screening era was found to be predominantly an iatrogenic disease in the investigated localities. This finding should direct attention and resources towards the development and implementation of preventive measures.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that the majority of acute hepatitis C cases in Israel (65%) were transmitted iatrogenically, through minimal procedures and clinical settings, with the majority of these cases occurring in older patients in monogamous relationships."}
{"answers": "Our results suggest a protective effect of breast-feeding among children with a family history of atopy that is not confined to the period of breast-feeding but continues during the first three years of life. Breast-feeding should be promoted in children with a family history of atopy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, our study suggests that breast-feeding may provide protection against childhood illness in children with a family history of atopy. Compared to children who were not breast-fed, those who were breast-fed had lower rates of gastroenteritis, lower respiratory tract infections, and digestive tract disorders in the first year of life, and fewer respiratory tract infections and skin infections over the next three years of life."}
{"answers": "Transrectal ultrasound guided and fusion biopsy cancer detection rates decreased with increasing prostate volume. However, magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy had a higher prostate cancer detection rate compared to that of transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy in the literature. Magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy represents a promising solution for patients with suspicion of prostate cancer and an enlarged prostate.", "prediction_text": "Yes, magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy can improve cancer detection in enlarged prostates. The overall detection rate of the magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion platform was 55%, with a significantly higher detection rate (71.1%) in prostates less than 40 cc. Multivariable logistic regression showed an inverse association between magnetic resonance imaging volume and prostate cancer detection, controlling for age and prostate specific antigen."}
{"answers": "There is no difference in postoperative morbidity, rates of rehospitalization, in-patient mortality or hospitalization costs in geriatric patients undergoing regional or general anesthesia for repair of hip fracture. Delay in surgery beyond 3 days and ICU admission both increase cost of hospitalization.", "prediction_text": "No, regional anesthesia did not significantly decrease morbidity, mortality, or healthcare costs in geriatric patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture compared to general anesthesia."}
{"answers": "Mesocolon invasion should be included in T4 for the staging of gastric cancer.", "prediction_text": "Yes, direct mesocolon invasion should be included in the T4 category for the staging of gastric cancer. The study found that patients with mesocolon invasion had significantly worse curability, nodal metastasis, and survival compared to those without invasion."}
{"answers": "Genetic variants identified in the present study may be insufficient to promote early carotid atherosclerosis.", "prediction_text": "No, mutations causing low HDL-C do not promote increased carotid intima-media thickness in genetic HDL deficiency states."}
{"answers": "The Turkish version of the EQ-5D-based utility score seems to be a valid instrument in the assessment of quality of life studies in patients with acute coronary syndrome.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the Turkish version of the EQ-5D has construct validity in patients with acute coronary syndrome, as it is significantly related to the MacNew heart-related quality of life scale."}
{"answers": "We found an improved survival associated with cardiologist care and a mixture of general practitioner and cardiologist care compared with general practitioner care. The pattern of outpatient care may therefore be important for the survival of patients with CHF.", "prediction_text": "Yes, specialty care (cardiology) is associated with improved survival of patients with congestive heart failure. Compared to patients who received general medicine care only, those who received both general medicine and cardiology care (MIXED group) had the lowest mortality rate. The risk of death was higher in patients who received only general medicine care (GM-only) or neither general medicine nor cardiology care (no-GM/CARD)."}
{"answers": "Comparison of mother-offspring and father-offspring associations for BMI suggests that intergenerational acceleration mechanisms do not make an important contribution to levels of childhood BMI within the population. Associations at later ages and for different components of body composition now require study.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is evidence to suggest that there is an intrauterine influence on obesity. The study found that the association between maternal BMI and offspring BMI is similar to the association between paternal BMI and offspring BMI, suggesting that the intrauterine environment plays a role in the development of obesity."}
{"answers": "TEE is useful to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors. An FAC less than 50% is present in 36% of potential heart donors. Because left ventricular dysfunction is often reversible shortly after transplantation, an FAC below 50% may not necessarily preclude the use of hearts for transplantation.", "prediction_text": "The study found that transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) can be used to assess left ventricular function in brain-dead donors and can help identify hearts that are suitable for transplantation. Of the 55 potential donors evaluated, 20 (36%) had an echocardiographic fractional area change (FAC) of less than 50%, which is considered a threshold for acceptable left ventricular function. Of the 40 hearts harvested from these donors, 36 were successfully transplanted, and the overall actuarial survival at 1 and 2 years was 86.2% and 64.6"}
{"answers": "Pediatricians should be alert to the earliest manifestations of AEA. Awareness of choking games among the young and, of those, a subset who eventually progress to potentially fatal AEA is strongly encouraged among all primary care professionals who may be able to interrupt the behavior.", "prediction_text": "Yes, autoerotic asphyxiation (AEA) is a dangerous and potentially lethal practice that can lead to unintended death, particularly among children, preteens, and adolescents. It is characterized by the use of hanging or other means of inducing hypoxia/anoxia to enhance sexual excitement, and can be conceptualized as a personalized, ritualized, and symbolic biopsychosocial drama. While it may provide a temporary sense of pleasure, the risks associated with AEA are significant, and it is important for pediatricians to be aware of this syndrome and to identify it in their young patients."}
{"answers": "The whole-body MRI protocol for the detection of bone metastases could safely be limited to the T1w sequence in adults, especially at 3 T. There is no need for an additional STIR sequence. These initial results will have a major impact on the department's workflow if confirmed by larger studies as they will help reduce examination time and therefore save financial resources.", "prediction_text": "No, STIR imaging cannot be omitted for the diagnosis of bone metastases at 1.5 T and 3 T. T1-weighted (T1w) sequences revealed a higher sensitivity for detecting bone metastases compared to STIR images, with a significant difference in the number of metastases detected between the two sequences at both field strengths (p < 0.05). In addition, qualitative analysis showed that T1w imaging had better lesion conspicuity, delineation, and image quality compared to STIR imaging at both field strengths. Therefore, STIR imaging should be used in conjunction with T1w imaging for"}
{"answers": "This study found that there was poor agreement between the AD's decision and the subsequent MR's decision regarding the fitness of those seafarers who decided to appeal against the AD's initial assessment. The reasons for this are considered.", "prediction_text": "No, the approved doctors (ADs) and medical referees (MRs) in the UK do not agree when assessing a seafarer's fitness. The overall agreement between the assessors (AD vs. MR) was poor (Kappa K = 0.18)."}
{"answers": "In our study, we suggest that glomerular hyperfiltration due to pregnancy does not have adverse effects on kidney in women with more parities. Pregnancy may have possible protective mechanisms for kidney against adverse effects of glomerular hyperfiltration.", "prediction_text": "Yes, glomerular hyperfiltration in pregnancy is associated with damage to the kidney in women with more parities. Women with four or more parities had significantly higher GFR values compared to those with no or one parity, indicating renal hyperfunction. This may be a sign of kidney damage in these women."}
{"answers": "Implant coating with an antibacterial-loaded hydrogel reduces bacterial colonization and biofilm formation in vitro.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the antibacterial-loaded hydrogel was able to deliver antibacterial compounds in vitro and reduce bacterial colonization and biofilm formation on implants."}
{"answers": "Location of death varies by country of birth. BAME groups are more likely to die in a hospital and less likely to die at home or in a hospice. Further investigation is needed to determine whether these differences result from patient-centred preferences, or other environment or service-related factors. This knowledge will enable strategies to be developed to improve access to relevant palliative care and related services, where necessary.", "prediction_text": "Yes, ethnicity affects where people with cancer die. The study found that decedents from certain ethnic groups were more likely to die in hospitals, while others were more likely to die at home. For example, those born in Asia and Africa were more likely to die in hospitals, while those born in the Caribbean were less likely to die at home. These findings suggest that there are disparities in end-of-life care for different ethnic groups, and that further research is needed to understand and address these disparities."}
{"answers": "Overall, 7% of women in our cohort met either clinical or molecular criteria for Lynch syndrome. All of these women had a prior history or a first-degree relative with an HNPCC-associated cancer. Limiting genetic evaluation to women with synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancer who have a family history suggestive of HNPCC may appropriately identify women with Lynch syndrome.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that 5 out of 59 (8.5%) patients with synchronous primary cancers of the endometrium and ovary had Lynch syndrome, which is an autosomal-dominant cancer predisposition syndrome that increases risk for multiple cancers, including colon, endometrial, and ovarian cancer."}
{"answers": "CMV-IgM and IgG antibodies assessment was not a potential discriminative test to identify congenitally infected newborns. In addition, low birth weight and small head circumference at birth failed to predict congenital CMV infection. CMV-DNA detection in umbilical cord blood at the time of delivery using real-time PCR of all newborns is recommended as decisive, rapid and non-invasive test.", "prediction_text": "Yes, low birth weight is a risk indicator for congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. The study found that newborns with birth weights below 2700 grams or head circumferences below 32 cm were more likely to have CMV DNAemia, indicating congenital CMV infection."}
{"answers": "The use of instrumental variables allowed us to demonstrate a significant relationship between better ambulatory process of care and better health-related quality of life. This finding underscores the importance of efforts to improve the process of care.", "prediction_text": "Yes, our study found a positive relationship between better ambulatory process of care and health-related quality of life outcomes for patients with chronic disease. Specifically, we found that patients who received better process of care had smaller declines in health-related quality of life scores over a 30-month observation window, and that the application of the best quartile of process of care to patients currently receiving poor process was associated with a 4.24 increment in health-related quality of life outcomes."}
{"answers": "To date, the newly developed Singapore equation is the most accurate BMR prediction equation in Chinese and is applicable for use in a large BMI range including those overweight and obese.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the currently used prediction equations for basal metabolic rate (BMR) in Chinese adults are not applicable for a large body mass index (BMI) range. A new prediction equation was developed using a sample of 121 men and 111 women in China, and it showed better accuracy compared to existing equations. The new equation is: BMR (kJ/d) = 52.6 x weight (kg) + 828 x gender + 1960 (women = 0, men = 1; R2 = 0.81). The accuracy rate (within 10% accurate) was 78% for the"}
{"answers": "This preliminary study demonstrated that OSCE ratings by LEs and REs were reasonably comparable when using checklists. Remote examination may be a feasible and acceptable way of assessing students' clinical skills, but further validity evidence will be required before it can be recommended for use in high-stakes examinations.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that remote physician-examiners can replace on-site physician-examiners in an OSCE, with statistically significant correlations between local and remote examiners' scores on several stations."}
{"answers": "ACR is an independent prognostic factor for maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes in suspected preeclampsia. ACR may be useful to inform risk predictions within a prognostic model.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the first urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) in women with suspected preeclampsia is a prognostic factor for both maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes. An increase in the log-transformed ACR was associated with an increased odds of adverse maternal and neonatal composite outcomes, as well as with reduced gestational age at delivery, in multivariate analysis."}
{"answers": "The effect on venous pressures caused by the change in patient positioning alone during liver surgery does not affect the risk of venous air embolism.", "prediction_text": "No, the position of the patient during liver surgery does not significantly influence the risk of venous air embolism, as there was no pressure gradient between the hepatic and central venous levels in any of the positions tested."}
{"answers": "The observations from this study provide limited support for the possibility that occupational arsenic exposure could play a role in the development of diabetes mellitus. Many other metallic compounds are also used in art glass production, however, and there is a possibility of confounding.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is evidence to suggest that exposure to arsenic among Swedish art glass workers may be associated with an increased risk of diabetes mellitus, particularly in combination with cardiovascular disease."}
{"answers": "Hospital preparedness can be better defined by a fixed number of casualties rather than a percentile of its bed capacity. Only 20% of the arriving casualties will require immediate medical treatment. Implementation of this concept may improve the utilisation of national emergency health resources both in the preparation phase and on real time.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the current readiness guidelines based on the epidemiology of encountered HMCIs are effective in predicting the surge capacity and injury severity distribution in Israeli hospitals during terrorism-related multiple casualty incidents. The study suggests that the key of 20% of each hospital's bed capacity as its readiness for multiple casualties is appropriate, and that the majority of casualties (79.2%) do not necessitate immediate medical treatment. However, the study also notes that the distribution of casualties and severity of injuries can vary widely in HMCIs, and that better prediction models are needed to improve hospital preparedness."}
{"answers": "While Italian primary care physicians appropriately target eradication therapy for H pylori infection in patients with peptic ulcer disease rather than nonulcer disease, the intervention was still underused in these patients. Improvements in this prescribing behavior are needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that primary care physicians underprescribe antibiotics for peptic ulcer disease (PUD). Of the 6866 patients seen by primary care physicians, only 690 (10%) received eradication therapy, with a significantly lower proportion of patients with PUD (27.6%) compared to non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD) (2%)."}
{"answers": "When cerebral hemispherectomy is performed to control seizures associated with very early (in utero) insult, it has been found that the remaining right hemisphere is still able to support reading and phonological processing skills that are normally mediated by the left hemisphere. Our results also suggest the existence of variability in individuals after hemispherectomy, even within groups having the same etiology and similar timing of insult.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the isolated right hemisphere can read to some extent. In this study, 60% of participants developed average-range word reading and paragraph reading skills, despite the fact that the left hemisphere was resected. Phonological awareness and nonword reading skills were spared in the majority of participants, and phonological awareness levels strongly correlated with word reading skills. Additionally, verbal memory and receptive vocabulary size positively correlated with reading levels, similar to those reported in average readers."}
{"answers": "Improved office-based practices regarding influenza vaccination could significantly impact Healthy People 2020 goals by increasing influenza vaccine uptake and reducing corresponding racial and ethnic disparities.", "prediction_text": "Yes, routine offering of influenza vaccination in office-based settings can reduce racial and ethnic disparities in adult influenza vaccination. Eliminating \"missed opportunities\" for vaccination in these settings could cut racial and ethnic disparities in vaccination by roughly half."}
{"answers": "The SPI was accurate in predicting the presence or absence of esophageal varices in patients with compensated cirrhosis.", "prediction_text": "Yes, non-invasive diagnosis of esophageal varices in patients with compensated hepatic cirrhosis is possible by duplex Doppler ultrasonography. The study found that the splenic index (SPI) was the most accurate parameter for predicting the presence of esophageal varices, with a cut-off value of SPI at 5.0 offering the highest diagnostic accuracy. The study also showed that SPI < 5.0 could correctly diagnose the absence of esophageal varices in 27 out of 28 patients, with a high negative predictive value (96%) and sensitivity (96%). Similarly, S"}
{"answers": "This study showed for the first time that RALP induces lower tissue trauma than RRP.", "prediction_text": "Yes, robotically assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) is less invasive than retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP) based on the levels of inflammatory markers (IL-6 and CRP) and lactate in the blood samples collected during and after the surgery. The study found that RALP was associated with lower levels of inflammation and lower lactate levels compared to RRP at various time points after surgery."}
{"answers": "The researchers studied a defined skin care protocol using a cleanser with aloe vera and a cleansing lotion, followed by application of either a moisture barrier with silicone or skin protectant with zinc oxide and menthol, undertaken at two different frequencies. Data revealed the incidence of moderate IAD was decreased in the experimental group (receiving the skin protocol every 6 hours and p.r.n.).", "prediction_text": "Yes, the incidence and severity of incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) were significantly lower in the group that received the skin care protocol every 6 hours compared to the control group that received it every 12 hours."}

Larger studies are needed to validate these findings and to explore possible mechanisms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patient coaching can reduce racial/ethnic disparities in cancer pain control. The intervention was effective in eliminating disparities in pain control between minority and non-minority patients."}
{"answers": "The association between plasma glucose levels and CVD risk is mainly explained by insulin resistance, which raises the question of whether glucose lowering per se without changes in the processes that underlie hyperglycemia should be the sole clinical paradigm in the treatment of type 2 diabetes or its prevention.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that insulin resistance drives the association between hyperglycemia and cardiovascular risk. The association between fasting glucose and cardiovascular risk was only significant after adjusting for insulin sensitivity, and the association between 2-hour glucose and cardiovascular risk disappeared after adjusting for insulin sensitivity and fasting glucose. Similarly, insulin sensitivity was still associated with cardiovascular risk after adjusting for glucose levels. These findings suggest that insulin resistance is a key factor in the relationship between hyperglycemia and cardiovascular risk."}
{"answers": "Tracheobronchoscopy is a useful and safe procedure and should be recommended in tertiary centers for babies with EA before surgical repair.", "prediction_text": "Yes, preoperative tracheobronchoscopy (TBS) can be clinically useful in newborns with esophageal atresia (EA). The study found that TBS was beneficial in 45.2% of the patients, including 24.2% of infants, in modifying the surgical approach. The procedure helped identify unsuspected proximal fistulas (type B) in 3 of 9 type A patients and undetected malformations of the respiratory tree in 4 patients. TBS occluded carinal fistulas in 14 type C patients to improve ventilation during repair, with no complications observed. Overall"}
{"answers": "The recently released seventh edition of the primary tumor staging system for kidney tumors is a powerful predictor of CSS. However, some of the substages identified by the classification have overlapping prognoses, and other substages include patients with heterogeneous outcomes. The few modifications included in this edition may have not resolved the most critical issues in the previous version.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the 2009 TNM version had limited predictive power for cancer-specific survival (CSS) in a large, multi-institutional cohort of patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Specifically, the novel classification of the primary tumor was a powerful independent predictor of CSS, but the stratification of pT1 tumors did not retain an independent predictive role. These findings suggest that further improvements may be needed in the TNM staging system for RCC."}
{"answers": "The Young-Burgess system is useful for predicting transfusion requirements. For the system to predict mortality or nonorthopaedic injuries, fractures must be divided into stable (APC1, LC1) and unstable (APC2, APC3, LC2, LC3, VS, combined mechanism of injury) types. LC1 injuries are very common and not always benign (overall mortality rate, 8.2%).", "prediction_text": "Yes, the Young-Burgess classification system was found to predict mortality, transfusion requirements, and non-orthopaedic injuries in patients with pelvic ring fractures. The system was able to differentiate between stable and unstable fracture types and predict mortality rates, abdomen injury rates, and transfusion requirements. However, the ability of the system to predict mortality only approached statistical significance, and further studies are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Parity is not directly linked to insulin sensitivity deterioration, to CP/FPG increase during pregnancy, or to GDM appearance, although it is linked through the mediation of progressive ageing and weight gain either before or during pregnancy, when there is a sufficiently long time interval between pregnancies.", "prediction_text": "Yes, parity (number of previous pregnancies) is associated with decreased insulin sensitivity during pregnancy, as measured by the peripheral insulin sensitivity index (ISI(OGTT)), and an increased risk of gestational diabetes (GDM). The relationship between parity and insulin resistance is strongest in women with three or more parity."}
{"answers": "The relationship between cognitive functioning and recognition of frequency compressed speech-in-noise was not statistically significant. The findings may have been different if the participants had been provided with training and/or time to 'acclimatize' to the frequency-compressed conditions.", "prediction_text": "Yes, cognitive function predicts frequency-compressed speech recognition in listeners with normal hearing and normal cognition. There was a significant relationship between cognitive ability and speech recognition in the unprocessed condition, but not in the frequency-compressed conditions."}
{"answers": "We conclude that beta1Gly49 homozygosity and TACC haplotype of ADRB2 gene, both loss-of-function genetic variations, may predispose to TTN.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant association between polymorphisms in the ADRB2 gene, specifically the beta1Gly49 homozygotes, and the risk of transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN)."}
{"answers": "MSWM does not appear to confer additional benefit as compared to the standard preoperative bariatric surgery protocol in terms of weight loss and most behavioral outcomes after LAGB in our patient population.", "prediction_text": "No, participation in a medically supervised weight loss program before bariatric surgery did not improve weight loss outcomes after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) in a publicly insured population. In fact, the study found that participants in the MSWM program had a lower level of physical activity compared to those in the usual care group after surgery."}
{"answers": "TAVI can be performed safely without balloon predilatation and with the same early results as achieved with the standard procedure including balloon predilatation. The reduction in the number of pacing periods required may be beneficial for the patient.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that balloon predilatation may not be necessary in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVI) as there were no significant differences in early hemodynamic results or complication rates between the groups."}
{"answers": "In our study; sex is not a significant predictor of recanalization rate, time to recanalization or 3-month outcome in stroke patients following IV rt-PA.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no significant difference in the effectiveness of rt-PA between men and women in acute stroke patients."}
{"answers": "Serum sample might be alternatively used in the difficult time of getting tumor tissue for analyzing the status of EGFR mutation status in patients with advanced NSCLC.", "prediction_text": "Yes, serum can be used for analyzing the EGFR mutation status in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study found that EGFR mutations were detected in the serum samples of 11 patients and in the tumor samples of 12 patients, with a high correlation between the mutations detected in serum and tumor samples (87.7%). The response to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors was significantly associated with EGFR mutations in both tumor samples and serum samples. However, there was no significant difference in overall survival according to the status of EGFR mutations in both serum and tumor samples."}
{"answers": "Although the provision of high-quality evidence-based resources, electronic or otherwise, is essential for standardizing care and improving patient outcomes, the authors' findings demonstrate that this alone does not ensure uptake. It is important to understand end-users, the environment in which they operate, and the basic infrastructure required to implement such a system. Implementation must also be accompanied by continuing education and endorsement to ensure both long-term sustainability and use of the system to its full potential.", "prediction_text": "The use of Web-based systems in medical oncology is promising, but its adoption and use vary depending on factors such as hospital location, clinician roles, experience, and attitudes. While Web-based systems can play a major role in guiding oncology treatment, clinicians' autonomy and perceptions of lack of time can hinder their use. Education and hospital policy are also important factors in ensuring the ongoing use of these systems."}

{"answers": "In patients with limb-threatening ischemia and lack of venous material for a straightforward venous femorocrural bypass, semi-closed endarterectomy of the superficial femoral artery combined with a short popliteo-crural bypass provides a good alternative.", "prediction_text": "Yes, semi-closed endarterectomy of the superficial femoral artery combined with a short venous bypass is an acceptable alternative for limb-threatening ischemia in cases where there is insufficient venous material for a straightforward femorocrural reconstruction. The study found that the cumulative primary patency and limb salvage rates were 60.3% and 68.6% at 1 and 3 years, respectively."}
{"answers": "Although the SLBM is quite repeatable, it underestimates mesopic pupil size and shows a too wide range of agreement with CIP. SLBM shows low sensitivity in detecting pupils larger than 6\u00a0mm, which may be misleading when planning anterior segment surgery. Previous grading-consensus training strategies may increase interrater reproducibility, and compensation for the systematic underestimation could improve accuracy of the SLBM.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the cobalt blue light slit-lamp biomicroscopy method (SLBM) can measure mesopic pupil size. The study found that the mean pupil diameter measured with SLBM was 5.81 \u00b1 0.70 mm, which is similar to the mean pupil diameter measured with Colvard infrared pupillometry (CIP) (6.26 \u00b1 0.68 mm). The intraobserver and interobserver repeatabilities of SLBM were good, with an intraobserver reproducibility of 0.97 and 0.92, and an interobserver reproducibility of"}
{"answers": "Although there are different patterns of atrophy across the different FTLD-TDP types, it appears that genetic and pathologic factors may also affect the patterns of atrophy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, TDP-43 type is associated with distinct patterns of brain atrophy on MRI in subjects with pathologically confirmed frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). The study found that different FTLD-TDP types were associated with distinct patterns of atrophy in the frontal and temporal lobes. For example, FTLD-TDP type 1 showed frontotemporal and parietal atrophy, type 2 predominantly anterior temporal lobe atrophy, and type 3 predominantly posterior frontal atrophy. Additionally, within the FTLD-TDP type 1 group, subjects with a progranulin mutation had"}
{"answers": "A set of educational interventions designed for cancer patients significantly improved their satisfaction with information on clinical research, but did not improve clinical trial enrollment of these participants as of 1 year after the study.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no significant increase in accrual into cancer-related clinical trials despite improved patient awareness and satisfaction with information."}
{"answers": "There was little evidence that people at high risk of falls received systematic falls risk assessment during rehabilitation. When a risk was identified, generally a strategy was implemented. However, failure to assess some risk factors might have limited fall prevention strategies offered. Failure to adequately address risks during hospitalization could contribute to falls post-discharge. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2016; 16: 570-576.", "prediction_text": "The study found that discharge documentation did not correctly identify falls risk for most patients, and there was limited assessment of falls risk factors and implementation of fall prevention strategies. Only 9 out of 50 patients had their falls risk correctly identified in their discharge documentation."}
{"answers": "Although most Medicare beneficiaries who received a new CIED between 2005 and 2009 did not have an initial in-person CIED follow-up visit within 2 to 12 weeks after device implantation, the rate of initial follow-up improved appreciably over time. This CIED follow-up visit was significantly more common in white patients than in patients of other races.", "prediction_text": "The study found that there is a significant variation in the frequency of follow-up visits for patients with new cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) in routine clinical practice, with some patient groups and time periods showing lower adherence to expert recommendations. Specifically, the study found that:"}
{"answers": "According to our study, there is a great variability when different brands and models of scanners are compared directly. Furthermore, the CT scan analysis and HU evaluation appears to gather insufficient information in order to characterize and identify the composition of renal stones.", "prediction_text": "There are significant differences in CT attenuation values for different types of urinary stones among different CT scanner models, which can lead to pitfalls in stone identification. The study found that the Toshiba Aquilion had significantly different mean CT attenuation values for some stone types compared to the Siemens Sensation and Philips Brilliance, while the Philips Brilliance had significantly equal values for all stone types compared to the Siemens and Toshiba. These findings suggest that the same information may not be obtained on different scanner models, which could lead to misclassification of stone types."}
{"answers": "Ophthalmic pathology and basic science research show that SBK and ASA are improvements in excimer laser keratorefractive surgery compared to conventional LASIK or PRK, particularly with regard to maintaining corneal biomechanics and perhaps moderately reducing the risk of corneal haze. However, most of the disadvantages caused by wound healing issues remain.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there are differences in the biomechanical and wound healing characteristics of corneas after excimer laser keratorefractive surgery between advanced surface ablation (ASA) and sub-Bowman's keratomileusis (SBK). The study found that ASA resulted in stronger and more rigid corneas, particularly in the anterior and peripheral regions, which may make it biomechanically safer than SBK for reducing the risk of keratectasia. However, both techniques still have some disadvantages due to inadequate reparative wound healing in the adult human corneal stroma."}
{"answers": "The Internet would be a practical and accessible way of delivering sexual health education to young people, particularly if it is incorporated into activities and websites they enjoy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the Internet can be used to improve sexual health awareness in web-wise young people.

{"answers": "Ultrasound not only has comparable sensitivity to that of X-ray for the identification of limb fractures but is also equally effective for the diagnosis of fracture type and dislocation. Thus, ultrasound can be used as an adequate alternative method to X-ray for pediatric fracture diagnosis.", "prediction_text": "No, ultrasound is not equal to X-ray in pediatric fracture diagnosis. While X-ray had some advantages in detecting fracture type, ultrasound was superior to X-ray in identifying dislocations. However, the findings were not statistically significant after adjusting for multiple testing."}
{"answers": "Although initial infection control rate was substantially lower in the retention group than the removal group, final results were comparable at latest followup. We believe retention treatment can be selectively considered for non-S. aureus infection, and when applied in selected patients, polyethylene exchange should be performed.", "prediction_text": "Based on the study, implant retention may not be recommended for the treatment of infected TKA, as the infection control rate was lower in the retention group compared to the removal group, and the only factor associated with infection control was the type of treatment. Additionally, the study found that treatment duration was shorter in the retention group, but there was no difference in the number of additional surgeries and length of hospital stay. The study suggests that two-stage revision surgery may be a more effective treatment option for infected TKA."}
{"answers": "The observed socioeconomic, demographic and microbiological differences between unmarried and married women could be responsible for the poor pregnancy outcome among unmarried pregnant women in Poland. Unmarried pregnant women should be covered by comprehensive medical care even before pregnancy. Further studies taking into account the role of psychological stress, patterns of sexual behavior and substance abuse during pregnancy could help identify the factors responsible for adverse pregnancy outcome among unmarried pregnant women.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that unmarried pregnant women in Poland were at higher risk for poor pregnancy outcome, including bacterial vaginosis (BV) and certain microbiological factors, such as higher risk of Mycoplasma hominis. The study suggests that socioeconomic and microbiological factors may play a role in poor pregnancy outcome among unmarried pregnant women."}

Additionally, there was a gradual increase in the mean scores of developed maps during the eight sessions of intervention."}
{"answers": "In this nationally representative population-based survey, HCMV seropositivity is associated with hypertension in women in the NHANES population. This association is largely explained by the association of hypertension with age and the increase in past exposure to HCMV with age.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is an association between human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection and hypertension in women, particularly in those aged 16-49 years. After adjusting for various confounding factors, the association remained significant."}
{"answers": "Although the cost-effectiveness of a single-pill strategy was within the acceptable willingness-to-pay threshold, the QALY difference were minimal. Further research is recommended to explore the long-term impact of the strategy.", "prediction_text": "The study found that combining antiretroviral agents in a single dosage form (FXD) did not significantly enhance the quality of life of HIV/AIDS patients compared to the multiple free dose combination (FRC) strategy, as measured by SF-6D scores. However, the study did show that the FXD strategy was cost-effective, with an incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of $45,540.49/quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) above the $40,000 threshold."}
{"answers": "2ME is able to enhance the antiproliferative activity of certain chemotherapeutics at pharmacological relevant concentrations. This estradiol metabolite is currently in a phase II trial in patients with refractary metastatic breast cancer and the tolerability has been shown to be very good. The combination of 2ME with chemotherapeutics may therefore offer a new clinically relevant treatment regimen for hormone-dependent cancer.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the combination of 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME) with certain chemotherapeutic compounds resulted in an additive inhibitory effect on the proliferation of human ovarian cancer cells, suggesting that the dosages of these chemotherapeutics can be reduced in treatment. Specifically, the combination of 2ME with epirubicine and carboplatin showed a significant additive effect at lower concentrations."}
{"answers": "Follow-up after endometrial cancer treatment varies in Italy. In this retrospective study, women with asymptomatic recurrence have shown a better clinical outcome compared with those with symptomatic relapse. The optimal approach is actually unknown, and guidelines comparing follow-up protocols have not been established. Prospective cost-effectiveness studies are needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, different follow-up modalities can play a role in the diagnosis of asymptomatic endometrial cancer relapses. The study found that among the 165 asymptomatic patients, clinical visit alone was the first procedure that led to further examinations in 60 patients, imaging in 103 patients, and cytologic examination in 2 patients. Symptoms at recurrence can predict survival, with patients with an asymptomatic recurrence having a median survival time from relapse of 35 months compared to 13 months if they had a symptomatic repetition. These findings suggest that imaging and cytologic examinations"}
{"answers": "Lower Infundibular height could be a good measurement tool for deciding which patients with lower calyceal lithiasis would benefit from SWL treatment. Height of less than 22 mm suggests a good outcome from lithotripsy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, infundibular height can predict the clearance of lower pole calyceal stones after extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy. In this study, patients with a higher infundibular height were more likely to have residual fragments after treatment."}
{"answers": "The interval from the onset of clinical symptoms to the initial surgical intervention seems to be the most important prognostic factor with a significant impact on outcome. Despite extensive therapeutic efforts, Fournier's gangrene remains a surgical emergency and early recognition with prompt radical debridement is the mainstays of management.", "prediction_text": "Yes, Fournier's gangrene is still a dangerous condition with a high mortality rate, despite the use of antibiotics and aggressive debridement. The study found that the mortality rate was 36% (5/14 patients), and the mean age of the deceased patients was significantly higher than the survivors. Additionally, there was a significant difference in leukocyte count between the two groups, with higher leukocyte counts in the deceased patients. These findings suggest that Fournier's gangrene remains a serious and potentially life-threatening condition."}
{"answers": "These four cases may belong to a variant form of HAM/TSP, predominantly involving the cervical cord levels.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the paper suggests that chronic progressive cervical myelopathy in patients infected with HTLV-I may be a variant form of HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). The study found that all four patients had positive anti-HTLV-I antibodies in both their serum and CSF, and biopsied spinal cord lesions showed inflammatory changes in one patient. Two of the three patients had a high risk of developing HAM/TSP based on virologic and immunologic aspects."}
{"answers": "The results of the current study demonstrated that there are factors that increase the risk of a leakage which would enable surgeons to define risk groups, to more carefully select patients, and to offer a closer follow-up during the postoperative course with early recognition and adequate treatment.

The study found that the residency training sites saw slightly more children, women, blacks, and Medicare and Medicaid patients, but the most common reasons for office visits were identical or similar between the two populations. Additionally, more preventive and therapeutic services were offered or performed at the res"}
{"answers": "Our findings suggest that, in HT+ postmenopausal women, the rs2813544 polymorphism may influence LDL-C levels and, as previously described, ESR2 rs1256049 is associated with T-chol and LDL-C. No previous study has investigated the association of this SNP set with lipoprotein levels in women while taking into account the hormonal status of the patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, polymorphisms in the oestrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) and oestrogen receptor 2 (ESR2) genes are associated with lipid levels in response to hormone therapy (HT) in postmenopausal women. Specifically, the ESR1 rs2813544 polymorphism was associated with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in HT-treated postmenopausal women, while one ESR2 gene haplotype was associated with total cholesterol (T-chol) and LDL-C in HT-treated postmenopausal women."}
{"answers": "The prevalence of PAD is high in nursing home residents. AAI is not predictive for IHD mortality in this population. In very frail elderly traditional risk factors and PAD are less important predictors of death compared to poor functional status, nutritional factors and previous cardiovascular disease.", "prediction_text": "No, the presence of PAD was not related to total mortality or to mortality for ischemic heart disease (IHD), cerebrovascular disease or other causes in older patients living in nursing homes."}
{"answers": "The data demonstrate that vaccination has a relatively weak and short-lasting effect in old age. The results of the study should stimulate discussions about strategies how vaccinations can be made more effective in old age. Improved campaigns, shortened vaccination intervals as well as the design of novel vaccines tailored to fulfill the specific demands of the aging immune system are imaginable.", "prediction_text": "The study found that protection against infectious diseases was frequently insufficient in elderly Austrian individuals, with many not being vaccinated according to recommended strategies and having low antibody concentrations and short durations of protective humoral immunity, even among healthy elderly individuals."}
{"answers": "The introduction of a discharge coordinator improved the quality of discharge planning, but at additional cost.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the introduction of a dedicated discharge coordinator resulted in improved quality of discharge planning and reduced problems experienced by patients after discharge, as well as improved patient satisfaction."}
{"answers": "Local anesthesia is not required to lower a patient's pain intensity when applying intra-articular contrast media for MR arthrography of the shoulder. This could result in reduced costs and a reduced risk of adverse reactions, without an impact on patient comfort.", "prediction_text": "The study found that local anesthesia did not significantly reduce pain intensity during MR arthrography of the shoulder. However, there was a significant difference in subjective pain perception between men and women. Therefore, it is recommended to consider individual patient factors and preferences when deciding whether or not to use local anesthesia during MR arthrography of the shoulder."}
{"answers": "A routinely inserted ENBD tube did not improve the clinical course, despite patients having to endure increased procedure time and discomfort, and the insertion would therefore be unnecessary.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no significant difference in the clinical outcomes between patients who received a routinely inserted endoscopic nasobiliary drainage (ENBD) tube and those who did not receive it after endoscopic clearance of common bile duct (CBD) stones in patients with choledocholithiasis-induced acute cholangitis."}

{"answers": "Patients in regional and rural settings were willing partners in developing skills of junior medical students, who had greater involvement in patient consultations than previously reported for urban students. Our study extends the findings from urban general practice that patients are underutilised partners in community-based medical training. The support of patients from regional and rural settings could facilitate the expansion of primary care-based medical education in these areas of workforce need.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the majority of patients in the study were willing participants in the new wave of community-based medical education in regional and rural Australia. They were positive about their doctor and practice being involved in student teaching and felt they themselves played an important role. However, they initially expressed reluctance to allow students to conduct certain aspects of the consultation independently, but after the consultation, they were willing to accept higher levels of involvement."}
{"answers": "Overall, in a US Air Force population, OSA does not predict a decrease in aerobic fitness as measured by cycle ergometry. However, patients with an apnea-hypopnea index of greater than 20 have a statistically significant decrease in aerobic fitness compared to the normal population. This study demonstrates the effects of OSA on aerobic fitness. Further correlation of fitness testing results with OSA severity and treatment is needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with decreased aerobic fitness, as measured by maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max) during cycle ergometry, compared to a normal population."}
{"answers": "Pictorial HWLs with didactic textual forms seem to work better than those with testimonial narratives. Future research should determine which pictorial HWL content has the greatest real-world impact among consumers from disadvantaged groups, including assessment of how HWL content should change to maintain its impact as tobacco control environments strengthen and consumer awareness of smoking-related risks increases.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that pictorial health warning labels (HWLs) with didactic textual forms may be more effective in addressing smoking-related health disparities among adult smokers and young adults with higher educational attainment. However, among those with lower educational attainment, the difference between didactic and testimonial narrative forms was weaker or not statistically significant. Additionally, the use of graphic imagery of diseased organs may be more effective in conveying the health risks of smoking compared to imagery of human suffering."}
{"answers": "Preferential transmission of AVPR1A to hypersexual or uninhibited people-seeking probands was not supported.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no significant evidence to suggest that the arginine vasopressin V1a receptor microsatellites are related to hypersexuality in children with a prepubertal and early adolescent bipolar disorder phenotype. The study found that there was no preferential transmission of the number of AVPR1A microsatellite repeats to hypersexual and uninhibited people-seeking probands, and no significant associations between hypersexuality or uninhibited people-seeking and the number of AVPR1A GATA or complex repeats."}
{"answers": "We suggest that regardless of family history, all children over 5 years should be screened for hyperlipidemia. Education about hyperlipidemia and precautions for its complications should be given to both children and families. The best and easiest way to reach children is to screen them at schools. School is also a good place for education of children about hyperlipidemia and risk factors.", "prediction_text": "No, family history is not a reliable predictor of serum lipid levels in school children. Despite 64.4% of the subjects reporting a family history of hyperlipidemia, no relations between family history and serum lipid levels were found in this study."}
{"answers": "These data indicate digoxin use may be associated with a reduction in risk of PCa. Given the potential mechanisms by which digoxin may exert an anti-neoplastic effect and other recent studies showing a negative association between digoxin use and PCa, further research is warranted.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that use of digoxin for cardiovascular disease is associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer. In multivariate analysis, digoxin use was found to be associated with a reduction in the odds of prostate cancer, with an odds ratio of 0.58 (95% CI: 0.30-1.10) in the overall sample and an odds ratio of 0.44 (95% CI: 0.20-0.98) among those with \u22653 PSA tests over the preceding 5 years."}
{"answers": "GHD men receiving GH treatment have a mortality rate not different from the background population. In women, after exclusion of high-risk patients, mortality was not different from the background population except for CVD. Mortality due to malignancies was not elevated in adults receiving GH treatment. Next to gender, the heterogeneous etiology is of influence on mortality in GHD adults with GH treatment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, growth hormone replacement therapy (GHRT) was found to reduce mortality in adults with growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in this study. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for all-cause mortality was 1.27, indicating a 27% reduction in mortality among GHD patients treated with GHRT compared to the expected mortality rate based on age, sex, and calendar year. Additionally, GHRT was found to reduce mortality due to cardiovascular disease (CVD) in women, but not in men. Sex, GHD onset, age, and underlying diagnosis were identified as influencing factors affect"}
{"answers": "It seems quite admissible and justified to encourage medical students to officiate as examiners in undergraduate emergency medicine OSCE formative testing, but not necessarily in summative assessment evaluations.", "prediction_text": "Yes, student examiners can be a reasonable substitute for faculty examiners in an undergraduate OSCE on medical emergencies, as students in the SE track performed significantly better in certain stations and overall, and reported higher ratings in the post-assessment evaluation. However, the effect sizes were mostly small, suggesting that faculty examiners may still be preferred for their greater expertise and experience."}
{"answers": "Expression of ER is a constitutional feature of the connective tissue and smooth muscle cells of the anal continence organ. Estrogen receptors and PR are not detectable in the striated muscle fibers of the external anal sphincter in either sex. The presence of ER in the stroma and smooth muscles of the anal canal suggests that these tissues are targets for estrogen. This constitutes a theoretical basis for the beneficial effects of estrogen and progestin replacement on anal continence in postmenopausal women.", "prediction_text": "The study found that estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR) are present in the tissues of the anal canal, specifically in the smooth muscle cells of the internal sphincter and perimuscular connective tissue of both males and females. The presence of these receptors suggests that hormonal influences may play a role in anal continence in women, as hormones can modulate smooth muscle function and tone. However, the study also found that the smooth muscle cells of the external sphincter did not show specific staining for ER or PR in either males or females. The implications of these findings for anal incontin"}
{"answers": "In women with bothersome MUI, concomitant AA repair does not result in additional improvement in OAB symptoms over MUS alone. Patients with postoperative complications exhibit less improvement in OAB symptoms.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no significant difference in the improvement of the overactive bladder (OAB) component of mixed incontinence between women who underwent concomitant midurethral sling (MUS) and anterior/apical repair (MUS + AA) compared to MUS alone.

Examining the lateral borders of the tongue is easily done, causes no harm and could be a valuable method for the dental profession to take active part in preventive healthcare.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant connection between sublingual varices and hypertension. The study found that patients with sublingual varices were more likely to have hypertension, with an odds ratio of 2.25 and a p-value of <0.002. Additionally, the study found that the presence of sublingual varices was associated with higher mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure values."}
{"answers": "Our data suggested that visually impaired pedestrians can make accurate and reliable street crossing decisions like those of normally sighted pedestrians. When using auditory information only, all subjects significantly overestimated the vehicular gap time. Our finding that blind pedestrians performed significantly worse than either the normally sighted or visually impaired subjects under the hearing only condition suggested that they may benefit from training to improve their detection ability and/or interpretation of vehicular gap times.", "prediction_text": "Yes, normally sighted and visually impaired pedestrians were accurate and reliable in their street crossing decision-making ability when using either vision plus hearing or vision only. However, blind pedestrians were the least accurate under the hearing only condition."}
{"answers": "Initial single scrotal incision can be recommended for orchidopexy, even in the more difficult cases of impalpable undescended testes. Advantages seem to include shorter operative time, a cosmetically appealing single incision, and possibly less pain. The scrotal incision technique significantly reduces the need for laparoscopy in impalpable testes. Surprisingly, it even allows successful orchidopexy of abdominal testes, provided an open processus is present.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the scrotal approach should be considered as the first choice for the treatment of undescended testes, both for palpable and impalpable cases. The study found that a scrotal incision orchidopexy was successful in diagnosing and treating 78% of impalpable testicles, with a low conversion rate to laparoscopy and no significant postoperative complications."}

Large, multicenter, prospective trials are required to further elucidate the optimal feeding strategy for VLBW infants.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the enteral feeding advancement affects the short-term outcomes in very low birth weight infants. VLBW infants born in centers with slow advancement (SA) had a higher rate of sepsis, particularly late-onset sepsis, compared to those born in centers with rapid advancement (RA). Additionally, more central venous lines and antibiotics were used in centers with SA."}
{"answers": "There appears to be no difference in the numbers of emboli detected when the first vascular clamp is applied to the proximal aorta or iliacs.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no significant difference in the number of emboli detected between the two sequences of clamp application during open abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery."}
{"answers": "GP hospitals seem to reduce the utilisation of general hospitals with respect to admissions as well as occupied bed days.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that populations with access to general practitioner hospitals (GP hospitals) utilize general hospitals less than populations without such access. The total rate of admission to general hospitals and occupied bed days were lower in peripheral municipalities with a GP hospital compared to central municipalities without one. The differences were most pronounced for certain diagnoses, such as respiratory diseases, cardiac failure, cancer, stroke, and fractures, which are primarily or intermediately treated or cared for in GP hospitals."}
{"answers": "The EBP unit was associated with better patient outcomes and more efficient performance than achieved by the same physicians previously or by SP concurrently.", "prediction_text": "Yes, evidence-based practice (EBP) was found to improve patient outcomes in the study. Compared to standard practice (SP), EBP was associated with a lower risk of death (6.27% vs 7.75%, P < 0.001) and shorter length of stay (6.01 vs 8.46 days, P < 0.001) among patients. No significant differences in admission rates or patient complexity were detected between the two groups. However, EBP doctors attended twice as many patients as SP doctors. These findings suggest that implementing EBP in internal medicine service can lead to better patient outcomes."}
{"answers": "Although travel burden is associated with timely diagnosis and treatment for some types of cancer, we did not find evidence that driving time was, in general, better at predicting timeliness of cancer diagnosis and treatment than driving distance. More intensive efforts at early detection of breast cancer and early treatment of CRC for Medicaid patients who live in remote areas may be needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, distance to provider is a barrier to care for Medicaid patients with breast, colorectal, or lung cancer. Specifically, the study found that later stage at diagnosis for breast cancer patients and longer time-to-treatment after diagnosis of colorectal cancer were associated with travel burden."}
{"answers": "Our results indicate that training managers in transformational leadership behaviours may have a positive impact on healthcare workers' health over time. However, more research is needed to examine the mechanisms by which transformational leadership brings about improved sleep quality; self-efficacy was not found to be the explanation.", "prediction_text": "No, self-efficacy does not mediate the relationship between transformational leadership behaviors and healthcare workers' sleep quality."}
{"answers": "The use of US helps in making a correct diagnosis and in the follow-up with objective criteria and also convinces the patient and the family that the treatment needs to be continued.", "prediction_text": "Yes, ultrasound can be a useful tool in the diagnosis and follow-up of constipated children. The study found that ultrasound measurements of rectal diameter and anterior wall thickness were significantly higher in constipated children compared to controls, and that the cutoff point for diagnosis of constipation was a rectal diameter of 2.44 cm. Additionally, the study showed that ultrasound can be used to assess the response to treatment, as there was a significant decrease in constipation score and fecal load after treatment for a month, but the rectal diameter had not yet reached normal limits. The study suggests that ultrasound can be a useful objective and reproducible tool for diagn"}
{"answers": "Brachytherapy with ruthenium applicators is an effective therapy for small- and medium-size posterior uveal melanomas. Our results are comparable to other series. The treatment outcome does not seem to be capable of improvement by increasing the apical dose. An internationally accepted model for defining the dosage in brachytherapy is needed.", "prediction_text": "The study found that escalating the apical dose from 100 to 160 Gy did not significantly improve treatment outcomes in beta-radiation of posterior choroidal melanomas with 106Ru plaques. The overall 5-year survival rate and disease-specific survival rate were similar in both groups, and the main side effects were mostly uncomplicated retinopathy."}
{"answers": "The addition of epinephrine to ACLS-SAPO increases vital organ perfusion pressures and improves outcome from cardiac arrest. There appears to be a profound loss of arterial vasomotor tone after prolonged arrest. This loss of vasomotor tone may make exogenous pressors necessary for resuscitation after prolonged cardiac arrest.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that exogenous epinephrine is necessary during selective aortic perfusion and oxygenation (SAPO) therapy for cardiac arrest. The study found that animals treated with epinephrine had higher aortic pressures during infusion, and a higher rate of return of spontaneous circulation compared to those treated with saline placebo. The results suggest that epinephrine helps to increase coronary perfusion pressure and may be necessary for effective SAPO therapy."}
{"answers": "In a leading specialty journal, cited reviewers gave higher scores than noncited reviewers. However, this\u00a0was likely due to their being assigned higher-quality manuscripts and not because they were cited in the manuscript. Reviewer requests that their work be cited were rare.", "prediction_text": "Yes, cited reviewers had higher mean scores for the desirability of the manuscripts they reviewed compared to non-cited reviewers. The difference in mean scores was found to be statistically significant after adjusting for the manuscript's mean desirability score."}
{"answers": "Preoperative education delivered by nurses reduced anxiety and postoperative complications of patients undergoing cardiac surgery, but it was not effective in reducing readmissions or length of stay.", "prediction_text": "Yes, nurse-led preoperative education can reduce anxiety and postoperative complications of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The study found that patients who received preoperative education from specially trained nurses had lower levels of state anxiety on the day before surgery and during the follow-up period compared to those who received standard information from ward personnel. Additionally, the intervention group had a lower proportion of chest infections. Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that education and trait anxiety scale score on admission were independent predictors of a reduction in state anxiety."}
{"answers": "Improving hospital efficiency by shortening length of stay does not appear to result in increased rates of readmission or numbers of physician visits within 30 days after discharge from hospital. Research is needed to identify optimal lengths of stay and expected readmission rates.", "prediction_text": "No significant correlation was found between decreasing lengths of stay and adverse effects on readmission rates or mean number of physician visits for any of the four diagnostic categories studied."}
{"answers": "Solitary kidney in a canine model is more resistant to ischemia than paired kidneys based on radiological, pathological and genetic evidence.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that a solitary kidney is more susceptible to warm ischemia-induced damage compared to a paired kidney, with a faster and more severe decline in kidney function in the solitary kidney group. The study found that the solitary kidney group had a 20% reduction in clearance at 1 week, which increased to 90% by 2 weeks, while the paired kidney group had a 23% reduction in clearance at 4 weeks. Additionally, the study found that the expression of proinflammatory markers was up-regulated in the solitary kidney group, indicating more severe inflammation. These findings suggest that"}
{"answers": "Elective re-siting of intravenous cannulae every 48 hours results in a significant reduction in the incidence and severity of PVT. We recommend that this should be adopted as standard practice in managing all patients who require prolonged intravenous therapy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, elective re-siting of intravenous cannulae every 48 hours significantly decreases the incidence and severity of peripheral thrombophlebitis in patients receiving intravenous fluids/drugs."}
{"answers": "We conclude that 3-phase bone scintigraphy prior to surgery could be a useful method to determine the amputation level in a diabetic foot. We conclude that further, comparative, more comprehensive, long-term, and controlled studies are required.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that 3-phase bone scintigraphy may be a useful method for determining the level of amputation in diabetic foot patients. The study found that scintigraphy was able to accurately determine the amputation level in most patients, with a high degree of correlation between the scintigraphic findings and the actual amputation level determined during surgery. However, the study was small and further larger, prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings and establish scintigraphy as a guideline method for determining amputation levels in diabetic foot."}
{"answers": "At baseline assessment patients of lower socioeconomic status showed lower health related quality of life. Since there was no clear trend at follow-up assessment this suggests that patients from different socioeconomic status responded to treatment similarly. In general, the findings suggest that quality of life is not only the outcome of the disease and its treatment, but is also highly dependent on each patients' socioeconomic characteristics.", "prediction_text": "Yes, socioeconomic status (SES) matters in quality of life (QoL) in lung cancer patients. Lower SES patients had more health problems, less functioning, and more symptoms at baseline compared to higher SES patients, but there was no significant difference between the groups at follow-up."}
{"answers": "General surgery research residents' intraoperative leadership skills showed significant correlations to their perceptions of skill decay and task difficulty during a bowel repair. Evaluating resident's directional instructions may provide an additional individualized intraoperative assessment metric. Further evaluation relating to operative performance outcomes is warranted.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that residents' leadership skills, as reflected in the number of instructions given to their assistants during the simulated small bowel repair, were related to their ratings of technical skill. Specifically, residents who rated lower levels of decay in their intraoperative decision-making and small bowel repair skills were found to use their assistants more by giving more instructions, and a higher number of instructions correlated with lower perceived difficulty in selecting the correct suture, suture pattern, and completing the entire surgical task."}
{"answers": "The severity of TAI is influenced by the sharpness of the aortic arch. There is an inverse relationship between the severity of aortic injury and the aortic arch index.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the anatomy of the aortic arch influences the severity of traumatic aortic injury (TAI). Specifically, the aortic arch angle was found to be significantly associated with the occurrence of type III damage."}
{"answers": "Clinical variables, either isolated or as components of a model, could not identify all children with pathologic radiographs.", "prediction_text": "No, clinical variables do not accurately predict pathologic radiographs in the first episode of wheezing."}
{"answers": "The results showed no overall first night effect on severity of RMMA frequency in young and healthy patients with SB. In clinical practice, one-night sleep recording may be sufficient for moderate-high frequency SB patients. However, low RMMA frequency in the first night could be confirmed by a second night based on the patient's medical and dental history.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a first night effect on sleep bruxism. The study found that the second night showed significantly higher burst index, bruxism time index, and mean burst duration compared to the first night. Additionally, five patients who were classified as having low frequency of RMMA on the first night were classified as having moderate-high frequency on the second night, while only one patient in the moderate-high frequency group moved to the low frequency group."}
{"answers": "Athletes engaged in competitive sports are more likely to develop ventricular arrhythmias during exercise. These arrhythmias subside over time when athletes are engaged in non-competitive sports.", "prediction_text": "Yes, ventricular arrhythmias in athletes tend to subside over time. The study found that among athletes who experienced ventricular arrhythmias during an initial exercise test, the majority had fewer or no arrhythmias during a repeat exercise test performed after a mean follow-up period of 70 months."}
{"answers": "A well developed collateral circulation does not predict an increased risk of restenosis after PCI.", "prediction_text": "No, a well-developed collateral circulation does not predispose to restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In fact, the study found that patients with good collaterals had more severe coronary stenoses at baseline, suggesting that they may be at higher risk of restenosis despite having a well-developed collateral circulation. The study also found that other factors such as stent diameter, stent length, residual stenosis, and smoking history were more strongly associated with restenosis than collateral flow."}
{"answers": "We conclude that patient and graft survival on transplanting kidneys from elderly donors to young recipients is superimposable on that obtained with young donors. However, renal function is better in the group of young donors.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that it is appropriate to implant kidneys from elderly donors in young recipients, as there were no significant differences in survival rates or graft function between the two groups at 1, 5, and 10 years post-transplant. However, there was a higher creatinine level in the young recipients of elderly donor kidneys compared to the control group."}
{"answers": "Many patients do not understand their ED care or their discharge instructions. Moreover, most patients appear to be unaware of their lack of understanding and report inappropriate confidence in their comprehension and recall.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that patients are often unaware of deficiencies in their comprehension of emergency department care and instructions. Only 20% of patients reported difficulty with comprehension when they demonstrated deficient comprehension in at least one domain. The majority of patients (78%) demonstrated deficient comprehension in at least one domain, with the most common deficiencies involving post-ED care."}
{"answers": "The results of this study suggest that normothermic CPB does not prevent the development of the \"euthyroid sick syndrome\" during and after CPB. Despite these changes in thyroid function, most patients in both groups had a normal postoperative recovery.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the temperature during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) does not have a significant effect on the development of postoperative euthyroid sick syndrome (ESS). The levels of thyroid hormones, including total thyroxine (TT4), total triiodothyronine (TT3), free T3 (fT3), reverse T3 (rT3), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), were comparable between the hypothermic and normothermic CPB groups."}
{"answers": "Severe hypoglycaemia is associated with an increased risk for CV outcomes in people at high CV risk and dysglycaemia. Although allocation to insulin glargine vs. standard care was associated with an increased risk of severe and non-severe hypoglycaemia, the relative risk of CV outcomes with hypoglycaemia was lower with insulin glargine-based glucose-lowering therapy than with the standard glycaemic control. Trial Registration (ORIGIN ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00069784).", "prediction_text": "Yes, severe hypoglycaemia is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, including the composite of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke, mortality, CV mortality, and arrhythmic death. The hazard for these outcomes was higher with standard care than with insulin glargine."}
{"answers": "EDWS is a safe and effective treatment for esophagogastric varices secondary to portal hypertension in selected patients. Patients treated with EDWS had a lower complication rate of portal venous system thrombosis compared with those treated with conventional MED.", "prediction_text": "Yes, esophagogastric devascularization without splenectomy (EDWS) is a safe and effective treatment for portal hypertension, with a lower morbidity rate of portal venous system thrombosis compared to the modified esophagogastric devascularization (MED) with splenectomy."}
{"answers": "Significant postoperative pain can be expected in the following situations: pain after prior surgery, presence of chronic pain sustained for more than six months, intense preoperative pain, state of depression.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the postoperative pain level can be predicted preoperatively based on certain factors such as a prior history of surgical pain, duration of prior pain, intensity of preoperative pain, and depression."}
{"answers": "The general practice selection process is predictive of future performance in the MRCGP.", "prediction_text": "Yes, general practice selection scores were found to predict success at the MRCGP examination, with a statistically significant correlation between selection scores and examination performance in the AKT and CSA elements of the MRCGP."}
{"answers": "Although the association of prostate and lung cancer is uncommon, the possibility of synchronous tumors should be considered in patients with urinary and pulmonary symptoms suggestive of neoplasm. It is important to determine if the lesion is a metastasis, since the prognosis depends on the second tumor.", "prediction_text": "The paper does not address the question of whether prostatic syndrome and pleural effusion are different diseases. The focus of the paper is on the association between prostate and lung cancer, and the characteristics of both tumors."}
{"answers": "The practice of intensive observation for the first transfusion in pediatric patients is probably unnecessary.", "prediction_text": "No, temporary ICU admission for the first transfusion is not warranted in pediatric patients, as only mild reactions occurred and none required ICU management."}
{"answers": "There is no indication of a rebound aggravation of symptoms 12 to 14 days after a 5-day treatment with lansoprazole 60 mg once daily in patients with reflux symptoms.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no significant difference in the rebound aggravation of symptoms between the group given lansoprazole first and the group given placebo first."}
{"answers": "Our long-term study showed significantly better (2-fold) results regarding the continence score for the abdominal approach compared with the transanal pull-through. The stool pattern and enterocolitis scores were somewhat better for the TERPT group. These findings raise an important issue about the current surgical management of HD; however, more cases will need to be studied before a definitive conclusion can be drawn.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the long-term outcomes of the transanal endorectal pull-through (TERPT) and the transabdominal (ABD) pull-through for Hirschsprung disease (HD) are similar, with no significant difference in overall scores. However, the study did find that the ABD group had better continence scores, while the TERPT group had better stool pattern scores. After controlling for age, the study found that age did not significantly affect the long-term scoring outcome between the two groups."}
{"answers": "The current study revealed an increase in health care services utilization from 2001 to 2009 in the older Spanish population.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the prevalence of health care services use increased significantly among elderly people (men and women) over the last decade (2001-2009), with a higher increase among women than men."}
{"answers": "It is concluded from the study that this knowledge if applied to dead human subjects, may preserve dead bodies temporarily allowing delayed funeral.", "prediction_text": "Yes, Raksi can be used as an alternative to standard embalming agents in preserving dead bodies, at least for a short period of time. The study showed that Raksi arrested postmortem changes in rats up to 72 hours successfully, with mild putrefactive changes observed only after 96 hours. Raksi's alcohol content (34%) and preservative, bactericidal, and disinfectant properties contribute to its effectiveness in embalming. However, it is important to note that Raksi is not a substitute for professional embalming services, and its use should be explored as a temporary measure only in emergency situations or in areas where standard embalming"}
{"answers": "The Holmium:YAG laser is an ideal intracorporeal lithotripter for ureteral calculi, with a high success rate and low morbidity.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that holmium:YAG laser lithotripsy is an efficient and safe treatment for ureteral stones, with a high success rate and low complication rate. However, the study does not directly compare the holmium:YAG laser with other intracorporeal lithotripters, so it cannot be concluded that it is the best option. Further studies are needed to compare the efficacy and safety of different lithotripters for ureteral stones."}
{"answers": "Our results suggested that s.c. anti-TNF pharmacokinetics do not significantly influence US-scored synovitis in RA patients.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no significant dependence of ultrasound-scored synovitis on the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous anti-TNF agents in patients with rheumatoid arthritis."}
