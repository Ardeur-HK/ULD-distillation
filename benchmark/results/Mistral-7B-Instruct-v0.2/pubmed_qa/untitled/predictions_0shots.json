{"answers": "These data suggest that being willing and fit enough for a chemotherapy protocol is a good prognostic factor for invasive bladder cancer. This eligibility bias emphasizes the need for prospective, randomized trials, and indicates that single-group studies using historical or matched controls have to be interpreted with caution.", "prediction_text": "The data from this study suggests that eligibility for a chemotherapy protocol after radical cystectomy for invasive bladder cancer is not associated with a better prognosis. The protocol group had a longer median overall survival (76.3 months) and median recurrence-free survival (67.2 months) compared to the remaining group (20.3 months and 9.4 months, respectively), but their outcomes were still worse than the matched group (52.1 months and 16.0 months). The protocol group also had a lower rate of tumor progression (46%) compared to the matched group (69%), but similar rates of cancer-related death (40"}
{"answers": "An additional delayed phase through the abdomen in routine contrast-enhanced CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis is of low yield, particularly if reliable follow-up imaging to further elucidate uncertain findings is available.", "prediction_text": "In this study, delayed imaging in routine CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis led to the identification of one significant finding (a renal mass) in 0.1% of cases, but resulted in a mean 59.5% increase in effective radiation dose and was of no benefit in 95.8% of cases. Therefore, the additional cost of radiation and time for delayed imaging may not be justified for most patients."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that the SCL 90-R is best viewed as an indicator of unidimensional emotional distress and somatic effects of structural brain injury.", "prediction_text": "The SCL 90-R obsessive-compulsive dimension is not related to objective measures of attention and verbal memory in individuals with brain tumors. However, it is significantly associated with symptoms of depression, anxiety, and subjective complaints of memory problems. The variance in SCL 90-R obsessive-compulsive scores is primarily explained by reported symptoms of depression (66%) and to a lesser extent by symptoms of anxiety (6%). Therefore, the SCL 90-R obsessive-compulsive dimension does not identify cognitive impairments directly but rather reflects emotional and subjective experiences."}
{"answers": "The results suggest that NA treatment can be stopped in selected patients with CHB as long as they are not cirrhotic, have completed a minimum period of treatment, have normal ALT and sustained undetectable DNA. These patients should be closely monitored during the first year and then indefinitely.", "prediction_text": "The study found that approximately 55% of HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B patients who discontinued nucleos(t)ide analogue treatment experienced virological relapse within 12 months, with a mean time to relapse of 6.38 months. Therefore, the feasibility of stopping NA therapy in this patient population should be carefully considered."}
{"answers": "The results of this study do not support the hypothesis that there is a direct link between atmospheric pressure values and abdominal aortic aneurysm ruptures.", "prediction_text": "The research paper did not find a statistically significant relationship between atmospheric pressure changes and aortic aneurysm rupture, but there was a non-significant trend towards higher rupture of larger aneurysms (>7 cm) when pressure increased between the day before and the day of rupture, particularly in patients with hypertension. The diameter of the aneurysm was not explicitly stated to influence the relationship between atmospheric pressure and rupture in this study."}
{"answers": "Findings from these studies support discordance between device-recorded and self-reported hot flashes. In addition, the studies reveal further limitations of SSC monitoring, including difficulties with data collection and lack of consistency in interpretation. Based on these results and other recent trials identifying issues with SSC methodology, it is time to find a better physiologic surrogate measure for hot flashes.", "prediction_text": "The study reports a low concordance rate of 24% between self-reported and device-recorded hot flashes using the second prototype of a sternal skin conductance device. Therefore, based on this research, sternal skin conductance may not be a reliable surrogate for hot flash measurement."}
{"answers": ": Prophylactic fixation with a cephalomedullary nail was not found to be cost-effective for the average older woman who sustained a hip fracture. However, it may be appropriate for select patient populations. The study supports the need for basic science and clinical trials investigating the effectiveness of prophylactic fixation for patient populations at higher lifetime risk for contralateral hip fracture.", "prediction_text": "In a 79-year-old woman, prophylactic fixation is not cost-effective for preventing a contralateral hip fracture. However, it is cost-effective for women between 71 and 75 years old with a 30% greater relative risk for a contralateral fracture, and for women younger than 70 years, as long as the additional costs are less than $6,000. The effectiveness and morbidity/mortality of the additional procedure significantly impact the cost-effectiveness of prophylactic fixation."}
{"answers": "We found that USMLE Step 2, number of honors in medical school clerkships, and AOA membership demonstrated the strongest correlations with resident performance. Our goal in analyzing these data was to provide residency programs at large a sense of which criteria may be \"high yield\" in ranking applicants by analyzing data from within our own pool of residents. Similar studies across a broader scope of programs are warranted to confirm applicability of our findings. The continually emerging complexities of the field of orthopaedic surgery lend increasing importance to future work on the appropriate selection and training of orthopaedic residents.", "prediction_text": "The study found that USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 scores, number of clinical clerkship honors, and Alpha Omega Alpha (AOA) honor medical society membership were moderately to weakly correlated with objective measures of orthopaedic residents' performance, such as American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery (ABOS) Part I scores and Orthopaedics In-Training Exam (OITE) scores. AOA membership was also associated with higher subjective ratings by faculty, particularly in the interpersonal and communication skills subsection of global evaluations."}
{"answers": "In vitro fertilization outcome is strongly correlated with both maternal ages, basal cycle, day 3 follicle, stimulated hormone, and antral follicle assessment. Antral follicle assessment was a better predictor of in vitro fertilization outcome than were age or follicle stimulated hormone. Antral follicle assessment may provide a marker for ovarian age that is distinct from chronological age or hormonal markers.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that a higher number of baseline antral follicles (>6) is associated with a higher clinical pregnancy rate in IVF, even after controlling for age and basal FSH levels. The cancellation rate was also lower in the group with a higher number of antral follicles. Therefore, antral follicle assessment may provide additional predictive value beyond age and FSH in IVF outcomes."}
{"answers": "Neither insertion of PEG tubes nor timing of insertion affect survival.", "prediction_text": "The study found no evidence that feeding tube insertion or the timing of insertion improved survival in advanced cognitive impairment residents with eating problems, as indicated by a hazard ratio of 1.03 (95% CI: 0.94-1.13) for the feeding tube group and 1.01 (95% CI: 0.86-1.20) for the timing analysis."}
{"answers": "In this well established early discharge program with nurse home visits, newborn metabolic screening is not compromised by early discharge.", "prediction_text": "Early discharge is associated with a higher rate of inadequate initial filter paper specimens but a higher rate of repeat specimens and a greater likelihood of having an adequate specimen within the first 9 days of life compared to traditional stay. The study does not directly address the impact of nurse home visits on metabolic screening adequacy."}
{"answers": "The palliative treatment concept of 25\u00a0Gy applied in 5\u00a0fractions is sufficient for radiation of lung cancer, given that there was no obvious survival improvement in patients treated with the higher total dose regimen.", "prediction_text": "The study found no significant difference in overall survival between patients receiving 25 Gy in 5 fractions and 50 Gy in 20 fractions of radiotherapy for palliative treatment of lung cancer (p\u2009=\u20090.334). However, a subgroup analysis revealed that patients with a good-fair overall condition had a slightly longer survival with 50 Gy in 20 fractions (p\u2009=\u20090.694), while those with a poor overall condition had similar survival times with both treatments (p\u2009=\u20090.248). Therefore, the data does not provide strong evidence that high-dose radi"}
{"answers": "Although elevated leukocyte count and CRP value cannot effectively establish the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the elderly, unelevated values exclude it. Accordingly, appendectomy is not recommended to be performed in an elderly patient with unelevated leukocyte count and CRP value, although clinical symptoms and signs indicate acute appendicitis.", "prediction_text": "The study found that in elderly patients undergoing appendectomy for suspected acute appendicitis, there were no statistically significant differences in leukocyte counts or CRP values between those with an uninflamed appendix and those with acute appendicitis. Notably, no patients with acute appendicitis had both values unelevated. Therefore, these measurements may not be reliable for diagnosing acute appendicitis in the elderly."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrates that in patients at risk for cardiac morbidity undergoing vascular surgery, desflurane is effective to control intraoperative hypertension without fear of major cardiac depressant effect.", "prediction_text": "Desflurane use to control surgically induced hypertension during aortic surgery does not significantly alter left ventricular function as indicated by no change in heart rate, cardiac index, stroke volume, end-diastolic and end-systolic areas, fractional area change, and left ventricular circumferential fiber shortening. However, afterload parameters such as systemic vascular resistance index, end-systolic wall-stress, and left-ventricular stroke work index increased with hypertension and returned to post-induction values with a mean end-tidal concentration of 5.1+/-0.7% desflurane."}
{"answers": "Development of tolerance to gluten seems possible in some patients with CD. Further follow-up will show whether this tolerance is permanent or only a long-term return to latency. This feature may be associated with genetic characteristics, especially with HLA genotypes that differ from DQ2 or DQ8. More insight into the mechanisms of the development of gluten tolerance may help to distinguish those CD patients that might not require life-long GFD.", "prediction_text": "Two out of 53 adult patients with celiac disease, who had been diagnosed 20 years prior, were identified as having developed tolerance to gluten based on the absence of immunological and histological signs. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and determine the factors contributing to gluten tolerance in celiac disease."}
{"answers": "No home-prepared replacement milks in South Africa meet all estimated micronutrient and essential fatty acid requirements of infants aged<6 months. Commercial infant formula is the only replacement milk that meets all nutritional needs. Revisions of WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF HIV and infant feeding course replacement milk options are needed. If replacement milks are to provide total nutrition, preparations should include vegetable oils, such as soybean oil, as a source of linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids, and additional vitamins and minerals.", "prediction_text": "The study found that WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF-recommended replacement milks for infants of HIV-infected mothers in South Africa fall short in providing adequate micronutrients and essential fatty acids, and are less cost-effective compared to home-prepared replacement milks using powdered full cream milk. Preparation times are also longer for fresh milk preparations."}
{"answers": "We have shown that eosinophilic inflammation of the airway wall may increase PD and that the association of eosinophil counts with ICSs may result in lessening the PD.", "prediction_text": "Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) negatively impact the perception of dyspnea (PD) during bronchoconstriction in asthma patients with airway obstruction, as shown by lower PD scores and negative associations with eosinophil counts and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) in ICS-treated patients."}
{"answers": "High socioeconomic status was associated with a higher acceptance rate of preventive home visits, but the association was attenuated by invitational procedures. The results indicate that the social inequality in acceptance of publicly offered preventive services might decrease if municipalities adopt more proactive invitational procedures.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that older people with higher financial assets were more likely to accept preventive home visits, but this association was attenuated when considering invitational procedures. The odds of acceptance were higher for older adults with low financial assets who were invited by letter with a proposed date compared to those with high assets invited by other procedures. However, the results had wide confidence intervals."}
{"answers": "In the present study, FT and androstenedione were statistically significantly correlated with sexual desire in the total cohort of women. ADT-G did not correlate more strongly than circulating androgens with sexual desire and is therefore not superior to measuring circulating androgens by mass spectrometry.", "prediction_text": "Inconclusive overall, but substitution of androgens improves sexual function in women with androgen deficiency. In this study, free testosterone and androstenedione correlated with sexual desire in some age groups, but no correlation was found between androgens metabolite ADT-G and sexual desire."}
{"answers": "The results of these analyses suggest that marginally higher rates of depression to age 35 amongst the comorbid MD/AUD group were explained by increased exposure to adverse childhood circumstances amongst members of the comorbid group. Adolescent MD/AUD comorbidity is likely to be a risk marker, rather than a causal factor in subsequent MD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that comorbid major depression and alcohol use disorder in adolescence is associated with poorer outcomes of major depression in adulthood, even after adjusting for confounding factors. However, the difference in depression outcomes between adolescents with major depression only and comorbid major depression and alcohol use disorder was no longer statistically significant after adjustment. Factors such as gender, childhood behavior problems, and exposure to physical and sexual abuse explained the associations. The data were obtained through self-report and may be subject to biases."}
{"answers": "There are no statistically apparent motion differences between SUP-CTV and INF-CTV. Current uniform planning target volume (PTV) margins are adequate to cover both portions of the CTV.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, there was no statistically significant difference in PB-CTV target motion between the superior and inferior portions (SUP-CTV and INF-CTV) in any direction (LR, SI, and AP)."}
{"answers": "Combined end points for adverse events are acceptable in the octogenarian. Carotid endarterectomy remains the gold standard for treatment of extracranial carotid disease in all age groups. Age alone should not place patients in the high-risk category for carotid endarterectomy.", "prediction_text": "The study included 103 carotid endarterectomies in octogenarian patients with no deaths and a low rate of neurologic complications (1.97%). Therefore, while some high-risk factors were present, the data suggests that octogenarians may not be uniformly high-risk for carotid endarterectomy."}
{"answers": "Lysosomotropic amines in combination with cyclosporine appear to be synergistic in the suppression of T-cell proliferation to MiHC and MHC. Use of chloroquine in combination with cyclosporine may result in improved control of GVHD.", "prediction_text": "The study demonstrates that lysosomotropic amines, such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, suppress T-cell responses to minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHCs) in mice and synergistically enhance the immunosuppressive effect of cyclosporine. This synergy is also observed in an alloreactive response. Chloroquine inhibits T-cell proliferation and MHC class II expression in antigen-presenting cells at lower concentrations, while higher concentrations induce decreased T-cell viability without affecting interleukin-2 or interferon-gamma production."}
{"answers": "The results of this study suggest that the cardiovascular response to exercise training may be different in men and women. Women may benefit more from interventions aimed to increase physical activity as a tool for prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.", "prediction_text": "Exercise training leads to a lower heart rate and higher heart rate variability in both genders. Trained women have a shorter QT interval compared to sedentary women, and the relationship between heart rate and QT interval is attenuated in trained individuals, with the gender difference in QT interval at low heart rates disappearing. No significant difference in mean QT interval was found between trained and sedentary men."}
{"answers": "Although BD is correlated with GCS at presentation and RTS, it is not a reliable prognostic marker for outcome and mortality in patients with isolated TBI.", "prediction_text": "The study found no statistically significant correlation between base deficit and mortality in patients with severe traumatic brain injury."}
{"answers": "\"Aquagenic maladies\" could be a pediatric form of the aquagenic urticaria.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that syncope during bathing in infants may be a form of water-induced urticaria, as indicated by the presence of dermographism and increased histamine levels in affected infants. However, not all infants fully recovered, with three out of seven continuing to experience troubles with sun or water after a few years."}
{"answers": "Laparoscopic procedures caused detectable damage to Kupffer and endothelial cells as reflected by elevation of post-operative HA serum levels. The damage to the liver hepatocytes and perisinusoidal cells has no clinical significance and the laparoscopic procedure itself is the probable cause of the Kupffer and endothelial cells damage, while other mechanisms caused damage to the hepatocytes.", "prediction_text": "The study found that while serum levels of hyaluronic acid increased in both the study and control groups, beta-NAH levels remained normal, and post-operative AST and ALT levels significantly increased only in the study group, suggesting potential liver cell damage after laparoscopic cholecystectomy."}
{"answers": "Sleep disorders are common in the general adult population of Japan. Correction for reporting heterogeneity using anchoring vignettes is not a necessary tool for proper management of sleep and energy related problems among Japanese adults. Older age, gender differences in communicating sleep-related problems, the presence of multiple morbidities, and regular exercise should be the focus of policies and clinical practice to improve sleep and energy management in Japan.", "prediction_text": "Yes, adjusting for reporting heterogeneity in self-reports is necessary in the management of sleep and energy related problems in Japan, as shown by the study using anchoring vignettes and the Compound Hierarchical Ordered Probit (CHOPIT) model, which revealed significant differences in the associations of sleep and energy with socio-demographic and lifestyle factors before and after correction."}
{"answers": "Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is often challenging in men on account of more adhesions and inflammation. This leads to higher conversion rates and more postoperative complications. Optimized planning and a more experienced operating surgeon may help overcome these problems.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that male sex is an independent risk factor for conversion to open cholecystectomy and biliary injuries during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Men also had longer operative times and higher rates of bile duct injuries, gallbladder perforations, and severe inflammation. However, there were no significant differences in mean hospital stay, wound infection, or port-site herniation between men and women."}
{"answers": "To uphold the notion for radiation exposure to be as low as reasonably achievable, ureteroscopic stone retrieval can safely be done without the use of fluoroscopy in a significant number of patients.", "prediction_text": "The study shows that fluoroscopy is not essential for the retrieval of lower ureteric stones as complete clearance was achieved in 94.2% of patients without using fluoroscopy. It was only required in 4% of cases for specific complications."}
{"answers": "Surrogates of injury severity, including days in the ICU and non-ICU hospital LOS>10 days, were associated with the development of HO in our cohort of acetabular fracture patients. Prophylaxis with XRT was significantly protective against the development of HO, and the ability to provide prophylaxis is very likely related to the severity of injury.", "prediction_text": "The length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) for more than 10 days and non-ICU length of stay greater than 10 days, as well as the use of external radiation beam therapy for heterotopic ossification (HO) prophylaxis, were significantly associated with the development of HO in patients with acetabular fractures treated with a posterior approach, while injury severity surrogates, age, gender, mechanism of injury, injury severity score, presence of neurologic injury, Letournel fracture type, occurrence of hip dislocation, interval from injury to surgery, operative time, and estimated blood loss were not."}
{"answers": "In this series of 35 patients, the use of epidural analgesia for HIPEC does not seem to be associated with a worse risk of haemodynamic instability, spinal haematoma, meningitis or epidural abscess. HIPEC with platinum salt is not incompatible with the safety of epidural analgesia, with an optimized fluid management peroperatively and the following of perimedullary anesthesia practice guidelines.", "prediction_text": "Based on the retrospective analysis of 35 patients undergoing cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC with epidural analgesia, no cases of spinal haematoma, meningitis, or epidural abscess were reported. However, five patients had thrombopenia or prothrombin time less than 60% before catheter removal, and two patients had leukopenia. No complications were noted on the day of catheter removal. Therefore, the use of epidural analgesia in this patient population does not appear to significantly increase the risk of these specific complications."}
{"answers": "The Diabeo system improved glycaemic control in both high and low users who avidly used the IDA function, while the greatest improvement was seen in the low users who had the motivational support of teleconsultations.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that high users of an insulin dose advisor (IDA) technology showed similar improvements in HbA1c levels with or without telemonitoring/teleconsultation. However, low users of IDA who received teleconsultation showed greater HbA1c improvement compared to those without teleconsultation. Therefore, while technology (IDA) can contribute to improving glycaemic control, teleconsultation may enhance its effectiveness in certain patient groups."}
{"answers": "Despite a lower risk of breast cancer, the Sami attended the NBCSP more frequently than the control group. The recall and cancer detection rate was lower among the Sami compared with the non-Sami group.", "prediction_text": "The attendance rate and recall rate were higher in the non-Sami group, but the rate of invasive screen-detected cancer was not significantly different between the Sami and non-Sami populations. The percentage of all breast cancers detected through mammographic screening was lower in the Sami group. However, the statistical significance was borderline (p=0.06). These findings suggest that there may be some differences in the early outcomes of mammographic screening between the Sami and non-Sami populations, but further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "GP ablation did not prove to be beneficial for postoperative stable NSR. A complete left atrial lesion set and biatrial ablation are advisable for improving rhythm outcomes. Randomized controlled trials are necessary to confirm our findings.", "prediction_text": "The research paper did not find a significant difference in the percentage of patients with stable sinus rhythm off-antiarrhythmic drugs between those who underwent Maze IV procedure with ganglionated plexi ablation (Group 2) and those without (Group 1). Therefore, the conclusion is that ganglionated plexi ablation during Maze IV procedure does not appear to be beneficial for maintaining long-term stable sinus rhythm based on the data presented in the study."}
{"answers": "It is concluded that serum pancreatic lipase is a more accurate biomarker of acute pancreatitis than serum amylase.", "prediction_text": "Based on the study's findings, serum pancreatic lipase has a higher diagnostic accuracy (AUC 0.948) for acute pancreatitis compared to serum amylase (AUC 0.906, P<0.05). However, both markers have their roles, as some acute pancreatitis patients may not have elevated lipase levels (2.9%). Therefore, while lipase may be a more accurate marker, amylase should not be completely replaced."}
{"answers": "Transgastric endoscopic splenectomy in a porcine model appears technically feasible. Additional long-term survival experiments are planned.", "prediction_text": "Yes, based on this study, transgastric endoscopic splenectomy is technically feasible in a porcine model. The procedure was successful in six pigs without complications during gastric incision or entrance into the peritoneal cavity. Visualization of the spleen and other intraperitoneal organs was good, and the splenic vessels were successfully ligated and the spleen mobilized using commercially available devices and endoscopic accessories."}
{"answers": "Brachial systolic blood pressure difference is related to the severity of SSS and can be used as a screening tool for SSS. However, it performed better in severe steal than milder steal phenomena.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that a greater blood pressure difference between arms is associated with more severe subclavian steal syndrome, as indicated by complete reversal or alternating waveforms in the vertebral artery."}
{"answers": "a-tDCS could be useful in identifying residual connectivity markers in clinically-defined UWS, who may lack of purposeful behavior as a result of a motor-output failure.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that transcranial direct current stimulation (a-tDCS) can potentially unmask cortical connectivity and excitability in some unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) patients, indicating residual networks that may not be observable through traditional diagnostic methods. This finding could aid in differentiating UWS from minimally conscious state (MCS) patients."}
{"answers": "Most people in France are influenced by situational factors when deciding if a physician should breach confidentiality to protect the spouse of a patient infected with STD.", "prediction_text": "Lay people and psychologists in France generally find it more acceptable than physicians to breach confidentiality to protect a patient's wife from a sexually transmitted disease. The patient's intentions to protect his wife and inform her of the disease have the greatest impact on acceptability. Lay people can be grouped into categories such as \"always acceptable,\" \"depending on circumstances,\" requiring \"consultation with an expert,\" and \"never acceptable.\""}
{"answers": "Most students do not encounter all 10 conditions during patient encounters throughout a 4-week EM rotation, although most have exposure to at least eight. Certain conditions are far less likely than others to be encountered, and may need to be taught in a nonclinical setting.", "prediction_text": "While the majority of medical students in a 4-year EM clerkship encountered at least eight of the 10 recommended core emergent conditions, only a minority (15.4%) saw all 10 during their rotation. The average number of core conditions seen per student was 8.4."}
{"answers": "The findings indicate that the clinical significance of symptomatic BDS is similar to that of CBD stones. Bile duct sludge seems to be an early stage of choledocholithiasis.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the clinical significance of bile duct sludge is unclear as it shares similarities with bile duct stones in terms of recurrence rates after endoscopic therapy and associated risk factors. However, common bile duct dilation was less common in the sludge group."}
{"answers": "Routine placement of nasogastric tube in patients operated of LSG seems not useful in reducing leaks' incidence.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that no nasogastric decompression was associated with a lower incidence of staple line leaks after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy compared to the use of nasogastric tubes (0% vs. 1.4%). However, patients without nasogastric tubes had a shorter hospital stay."}
{"answers": "The results obtained in this study demonstrate that LUS is an accurate and highly sensitive procedure in staging colorectal cancer, providing a useful and reliable diagnostic tool complementary to laparoscopy.", "prediction_text": "Laparoscopic ultrasonography (LUS) shows high sensitivity for detecting hepatic metastases (100%) and nodal metastases (94%) compared to preoperative staging, but has lower specificity (53%). It led to changes in therapeutic programs in 15 cases (45%)."}
{"answers": "Most community providers believe IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion; this belief is associated with increased resource use. Experts comply more closely with guidelines to diagnose IBS with minimal testing. This disconnect suggests that better implementation of guidelines is warranted to minimize variation and improve cost-effectiveness of care.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, IBS experts were less likely than nonexperts to consider IBS a diagnosis of exclusion. The experts made more positive diagnoses of IBS, performed fewer tests, and spent less money on testing compared to nonexperts. Providers who believed IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion ordered more tests and spent more money. The study suggests that IBS may not be a diagnosis of exclusion as guidelines suggest."}
{"answers": "Correlation between level of radiographic transition zone on contrast enema and length of aganglionosis remains low. Systematic preoperative biopsy by coelioscopy or ombilical incision is mandatory.", "prediction_text": "The radiographic transition zone in Hirschsprung's disease has a weak correlation with the actual length of aganglionosis on the specimen, with a global agreement of 58.1% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.39 (CI [0.24; 0.57])."}
{"answers": "The presence of a high signal intensity change on T2-weighted MRI and the pyramidal tract sign can be used as prognostic factors for patients with CSA.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the presence of T2 high signal intensity areas on MRI and the conversion to surgery are associated with a poorer neurological prognosis in patients with cervical spondylotic amyotrophy, as well as the presence of the pyramidal tract sign before surgery."}
{"answers": "We conclude that not all low-tone sudden deafness (SD) patients suffered from endolymphatic hydrops even if they had vertigo attack at the onset and that electrocochleography (ECochG) was a useful prognostic tool.", "prediction_text": "The study found that not all cases of low-tone sudden deafness progress to Meniere's disease. The rate of progression was similar in low-tone and high-tone Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss (SSHL) groups. However, those with low-tone SSHL and recurrent episodes had smaller average summating potential (SP)/action potential (AP) ratios compared to those with single episodes and Meniere's disease."}
{"answers": "It is concluded that ACE-DD genotype may be a risk factor for the causation and development of chronic kidney failure among hypertensive patients.", "prediction_text": "The study found an association between the D allele of the ACE-1 gene and the risk of chronic kidney disease among hypertensive patients (OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 0.86-1.79). Additionally, the DD genotype of the ACE-1 gene was associated with higher total and HDL cholesterol levels (OR = 1.42, 95% CI = 0.72-2.81)."}
{"answers": "Older people with a history of amblyopia who develop visual loss in the previously normal eye can experience recovery of visual function in the amblyopic eye over a period of time. This recovery in visual function occurs in the wake of visual loss in the fellow eye and the improvement appears to be sustained.", "prediction_text": "The study found that in some cases of age related macular degeneration, visual improvement in amblyopic eyes was observed, with a mean improvement of 3.3 lines in distance acuity and 1.9 lines in near acuity over 12 months. This improvement occurred within the first 12 months and remained stable during follow-up."}
{"answers": "These results suggest that quantitative real-time PCR assays for BCRABL detection can be comparable between laboratories despite significant differences in methodologies if the same positive control cell line and quality control gene are used. It is imperative that some level of assay standardization be adopted between laboratories, not only for patients who are monitored at different facilities, but also for larger investigative studies in which hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular responses are to be compared.", "prediction_text": "Yes, correlated results are possible for BCRABL transcript detection by quantitative real-time PCR despite using different methods, as shown by a strong correlation coefficient (r(s) = 0.9435, p<0.00001) in this study involving two laboratories. However, discrepancies may occur due to variations in RNA yield."}
{"answers": "Although the exact mechanism of SSDH in this case is unclear, we speculate that this SSDH was a hematoma that migrated from the intracranial subdural space. Low CSF pressure because of continuous drainage and intrathecal thrombolytic therapy may have played an important role in the migration of the hematoma through the spinal canal. It is important to recognize the SSDH as a possible complication of the SAH accompanied with intracranial subdural hematoma.", "prediction_text": "A case report of a rare occurrence of spinal subdural hematoma following a ruptured intracranial internal carotid aneurysm. The patient recovered with conservative treatment and complete resolution within 15 weeks."}
{"answers": "LAA occlusion device resulted in a slightly movement in QRS axis, reduced HR and increased the mean-mean QT interval duration. In addition, LA diameter and ARD seemed to be larger after device implantation.", "prediction_text": "The study found that LAA occlusion therapy resulted in a slight QRS electric axis shift and significant changes in heart rate and QT interval on ECG. However, no significant differences were observed in echocardiographic parameters immediately after the procedure. During follow-up, a larger LA diameter and ARD were detected."}
{"answers": "The study results suggested that spinal cord untethering may be unnecessary in patients with MM who are undergoing scoliosis corrective surgery and do not present with clinical symptoms of a tethered cord, even though tethering is radiographically demonstrated.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that in carefully selected patients with myelomeningocele and radiographically tethered spinal cords who have not experienced neurological symptoms or shunt complications, scoliosis correction surgery can be performed without untethering procedures prior to surgery, and may result in successful outcomes with minimal neurological or shunt complications. However, individual patient assessment and close postoperative monitoring are essential."}
{"answers": "Under the conditions of this study, pulpotomy offered a viable alternative to root canal treatment for teeth with vital pulps in the short term. However, there is insufficient clinical evidence to consider this technique for the treatment of every permanent tooth. Nevertheless, it should be considered as a potential alternative approach to be further developed for future applications.", "prediction_text": "Based on the study, the survival rate of teeth treated with pulp chamber pulpotomy using ProRoot MTA(\u00ae) and followed up for 12 to 24 months was 82%. However, two teeth required root canal treatment for pain control and one for prosthetic reasons. Therefore, while pulp chamber pulpotomy can be effective in the short term, it may not be considered a permanent treatment."}
{"answers": "The site of access in our study does not appear to influence complications specifically neural injury or recurrence rates.", "prediction_text": "The study found no significant difference in early outcomes, including complications and recurrence rates, between gaining small saphenous vein access above or below mid-calf levels during endovenous laser ablation for small saphenous varicose veins. Both groups showed significant improvement in clinical scores and patient satisfaction up to 1 year."}
{"answers": "Retinal haemorrhages following a convulsive episode are rare. Such a finding should trigger an extensive search for other reasons, including child abuse.", "prediction_text": "In this study, out of 153 children with convulsions, only one case of unilateral retinal hemorrhage was identified, which was not related to any systemic disorder. Therefore, the occurrence of retinal hemorrhages after convulsive episodes is rare and further investigation for child abuse may not be warranted in every case."}
{"answers": "Clear and distinct differences between the two studied groups were found indicating the root of this increased confidence may have developed due to exposure to the Pathway program.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the Global Longitudinal Pathway medical education curriculum significantly influenced medical students' skills and attitudes toward culturally diverse populations, as evidenced by higher confidence ratings in Years 2, 3, and 4, and similar qualitative findings."}
{"answers": "In normal daily practice, only a small number of clinically important adenomas are missed. The problem of missed adenomas probably is being exaggerated.", "prediction_text": "Based on the study, approximately 1.3% of colorectal cancers may be due to missed adenomas during previous endoscopies."}
{"answers": "Emotional prosody, therefore, seems to be partially processed outside the focus of spatial attention. Whereas at early sensory processing stages spatial attention modulates the degree of emotional voice processing as a function of emotional valence, emotional prosody is processed outside of the focus of spatial attention at later processing stages.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the processing of affective prosody interacts with spatial attention at early processing stages (<200 ms) but is additive at later processing stages (>200 ms), as indicated by event-related potentials (ERPs) in the electro-encephalogram (EEG) data."}
{"answers": "Pancreas retransplantation is a safe procedure with acceptable graft survival that should be proposed to diabetic patients who have lost their primary graft.", "prediction_text": "Yes, pancreas retransplantation can provide a second chance for diabetic patients with end-stage renal disease, as shown by improved second pancreas survival compared to their first graft in this study, regardless of the cause of first graft loss. Additionally, patient survival and kidney graft function were excellent in second simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplantations."}
{"answers": "Weekend hospitalization leads to delayed provision of intensive procedures and elevated 1-year mortality for elderly AMI patients. The existence of measurable differences in treatments raises questions regarding the efficacy of a single input regulation (e.g., mandated nurse staffing ratios) in enhancing the quality of weekend care. My results suggest that targeted financial incentives might be a more cost-effective policy response than broad regulation aimed at improving quality.", "prediction_text": "According to the research, elderly Medicare patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction on weekends are less likely to receive immediate intensive cardiac procedures and experience higher rates of adverse health outcomes, including increased mortality and readmission with congestive heart failure."}
{"answers": "The presence of more than one virus in hospitalized children with ARI is very frequent but it does not seem to have a major clinical impact in terms of severity. However bacterial superinfection increases the severity of the disease course. On the contrary, pneumococcal vaccination plays a protective role.", "prediction_text": "The research paper did not find a correlation between the number of detected viruses and severity of acute respiratory infection in children. However, bacterial superinfection was associated with increased severity, longer hospital stays, and higher respiratory support requirement. Pneumococcal vaccination was a protective factor against severity and the need for respiratory support."}
{"answers": "In our study, it was observed that although longer ETA was associated with longer hospitalization, ETA was not correlated with postoperative complications. Our results inclined toward the position that appendectomy can be performed as a semielective surgery.", "prediction_text": "The research paper did not find a significant association between extended emergency room to appendectomy time (ETA) and the incidence of postoperative complications in patients with acute appendicitis. However, patients with longer ETA had longer hospital stays. Age \u226555 years, perforated appendicitis, and open appendectomy were identified as predictors for postoperative complications."}
{"answers": "Fetal gender does not affect the risk of having an ED visit for asthma during pregnancy, and it is not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes among women who had an asthma-related ED during pregnancy.", "prediction_text": "The research paper found no evidence that fetal gender is associated with emergency department visits for asthma during pregnancy (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85-1.19)."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that working exposure increases the risk or leads to the clinical manifestation of rotator cuff tears. Although a detailed analysis of individual physical exposure is not available yet, the statistical results indicate that rotator cuff tears must be taken into consideration as a result of ergonomic exposure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found a significant association between rotator cuff tears in males and occupations in agriculture and forestry, as well as in the building industry. (6.38% and 35.11% versus 1.07% and 13.40% in Bavaria, respectively, p<0.001)"}
{"answers": "High-quality training, strict compliance with evidence-based guidelines, and thorough documentation is associated with significant reductions in CLABSIs. Mindful organizing may lead to a better understanding of what goes into a unit's ability to handle peak demands and sustain extraordinary performance in the long-term.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a zero CLABSI rate is sustainable for extended periods in the NICU when standardized care practices, ongoing training, surveillance, and vigilance are implemented and maintained."}
{"answers": "Ketamine sedation was successful and well tolerated in all cases. The use of atropine as an adjunct for intramuscular ketamine sedation in children significantly reduces hypersalivation and may lower the incidence of post-procedural vomiting. Atropine is associated with a higher incidence of a transient rash. No serious adverse events were noted.", "prediction_text": "The study found that atropine reduced the incidence of hypersalivation during ketamine sedation in children, but increased the risk of transient rash and vomiting. There was a trend towards better tolerance in the placebo group. No serious side effects were reported. The decision to use atropine with ketamine sedation should consider the trade-off between these findings and the specific needs of the individual patient."}
{"answers": "Findings depict wandering and PNA as overlapping, but nonequivalent phenomena. Evidence supporting construct validity of wandering was more robust than that for PNA. Results have implications for accuracy in scientific and clinical detection and labeling of wandering and agitation.", "prediction_text": "The study found a significant correlation between wandering and physically nonaggressive agitation (PNA), with a stronger correlation with PNA Factor 1 (43.66% explained variance for wandering and 53.45% for PNA Factor 1). However, the correlation with PNA Factor 2 was lower for wandering. While there is some overlap, the findings suggest that wandering and PNA are not identical concepts."}
{"answers": "An advance care planning model is feasible for community palliative care services. Quality audit processes are an essential component of the Model with documentation of advance care planning discussion established as an important outcome measure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that an advance care planning model is feasible in community palliative care settings, with a focus on embedding the model into organizational structures, prioritizing conversations and family involvement, and adapting quality audit processes."}
{"answers": "The study allows us to determine that FB can move through the body but not towards the heart. The study also serves as a warning sign: in cases of prolonged histories of FB ingestion, imaging studies are mandatory before endoscopic examination.", "prediction_text": "Yes, some foreign bodies, particularly those implanted in the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract, can migrate and potentially move towards the heart. The mechanisms and risks of migration, as well as diagnostic approaches, are discussed in the paper based on case studies of four migrated foreign bodies."}
{"answers": "Although most players in the study believe that rugby headgear may prevent concussion, only a minority reported wearing it. Coaches tended to be less convinced than the players that rugby headgear can prevent concussion.", "prediction_text": "The research suggests that while a majority of rugby players believe headgear can prevent concussion, only a minority actually use it and most coaches do not consider its use mandatory. Therefore, the evidence from this study does not definitively answer the question of whether rugby headgear prevents concussion."}
{"answers": "Early oral intake is possible after laparotomy and colorectal resection. Thus, the laparoscopic surgeon's claim of early tolerated oral intake may not be unique to laparoscopy.", "prediction_text": "The study found no significant difference in the rate of nasogastric tube reinsertion or the duration of postoperative ileus between patients who received early oral intake after laparotomy and those who were fed traditionally. Therefore, early postoperative oral intake is not limited to laparoscopic surgery."}
{"answers": "Both medial and lateral PTS were significantly steeper in failures of ACLR than the control group. Medial or lateral PTS \u22655\u00b0 was a new risk factor of ACLR failure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, this retrospective study found that both medial and lateral steep posterior tibial slopes were significantly associated with increased odds of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction failure. Specifically, the medial PTS was 3.5 degrees steeper (P = 0.000) and the lateral PTS was 2.6 degrees steeper (P = 0.006) in the failure group compared to the control group. The odds ratio for ACLR failure was 6.8 for medial PTS \u2265 5 degrees (P = 0.007) and 10.8 for lateral PTS \u2265 5 degrees ("}
{"answers": "These results suggest the need to provide interventions that are specifically designed to increase awareness of potential stroke signs and symptoms and appropriate subsequent clinical actions.", "prediction_text": "Based on the research, only 37% of elderly patients, on average, correctly respond to call 911 when presented with signs and symptoms of acute stroke. Factors associated with a higher likelihood of correct endorsement include higher levels of education."}
{"answers": "We conclude that routine CXR after bronchoscopy with TBB is necessary only in patients with symptoms suggestive of pneumothorax. In asymptomatic patients, pneumothorax is rare and usually small, so routine CXR is not necessary in this category of patients.", "prediction_text": "Based on the study, approximately 3% of patients with transbronchial biopsy developed symptomatic pneumothorax, which was detected by chest radiography. However, seven out of ten pneumothorax cases were symptomatic before the radiography. Asymptomatic patients with minimal pneumothorax resolved spontaneously. Therefore, the study suggests that symptomatic patients and those with large pneumothorax may benefit from routine chest radiography, but for asymptomatic patients, the need for radiography may be questionable."}
{"answers": "Early surfactant administration is associated with shorter duration of ventilation but does not appear to be significantly protective against CLD/mortality among premature infants. This may support the growing evidence for consideration of CPAP as an alternative to routine intubation and early surfactant administration. Further investigation from large randomized clinical trials is warranted to confirm these results.", "prediction_text": "The study found that early surfactant administration within one hour of birth was not associated with a lower rate of chronic lung disease or mortality compared to late surfactant administration in premature infants. However, early surfactant was associated with longer durations of CPAP and hospital stay, and shorter duration of mechanical ventilation."}
{"answers": "The study supports the hypothesis that nurses' aides who were exposed to ETS at home during childhood have an increased risk of long-term sickness absence.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that individuals who were exposed to environmental tobacco smoke during childhood had an increased risk of long-term sick leave from work, specifically for neck pain, high and low back pain, and any illness, even after adjusting for various factors. The risk was also higher for sick leave exceeding 8 weeks."}
{"answers": "We concluded that depiction of the superior wall of the mandibular canal cannot be improved by changing the thickness of images.", "prediction_text": "The study found that 0.9 mm-thick double-oblique CT images provided the highest mandibular depiction, but there was no significant difference between 0.3 mm and 0.9 mm-thick images."}
{"answers": "Exclusive CRT approach is not safe to treat patients with low infiltrative rectal carcinoma.", "prediction_text": "For mid and low rectal tumors with complete response to chemoradiation, long-term survival is possible without surgery. However, local recurrence is high in those with incomplete or no response, and surgery is necessary. Overall survival is negatively affected by lymph node metastases and perineural invasion. Therefore, while chemoradiation can reduce local recurrence and improve resection, it is not a definitive cure and carries risks. The decision to use chemoradiation instead of surgery should be individualized based on tumor response and patient factors."}
{"answers": "Random survival forests did not yield higher performance compared to Cox proportional hazards. We found improvement in prediction performance when coupling the genetic SNP score with clinical/demographic markers, which warrants further investigation.", "prediction_text": "The study found that adding validated susceptibility SNP scores to risk models for BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers did not significantly improve predictive ability beyond that of clinical and demographic information, as indicated by similar concordance index values (0.215 for BRCA2 and 0.221 for BRCA1)."}
{"answers": "Bedtime NPH insulin added to maximal therapy with sulfonylurea and metformin is an effective, simple, well-tolerated approach for patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes.", "prediction_text": "In this open-label trial, adding insulin to unchanged oral hypoglycemic medication resulted in fewer treatment failures, less weight gain, and fewer hypoglycemic events compared to insulin monotherapy in insulin-naive type 2 diabetes patients. However, HbA1c improvement was similar in both groups. The choice between the two approaches should consider individual patient preferences and tolerability."}
{"answers": "PET data show that amoxapine's profile is very similar to that of the established atypical antipsychotics. These data, together with amoxapine's in vitro pharmacologic profile, effectiveness in animal models, and efficacy in psychotic depression raise the possibility of amoxapine as an \"atypical\" antipsychotic agent in the treatment of schizophrenia.", "prediction_text": "Based on the research paper, amoxapine exhibits high 5-HT2 occupancy and greater 5-HT2 than D2 occupancy at clinically relevant doses, consistent with the profile of atypical antipsychotics. The absence of D2 occupancy exceeding 80% further supports this classification."}
{"answers": "In gravid ewes, intravenous infusion of<or = 1.67 micrograms/min epinephrine altered neither maternal hemodynamics nor uterine blood flow. To the extent that sheep data can be extrapolated to humans, these results suggest that continuous intravenous infusion of epinephrine in local anesthetic solutions is safe if the epidural catheter should enter a blood vessel during the infusion.", "prediction_text": "No, continuous intravenous infusion of low-concentration epinephrine does not impair uterine blood flow in pregnant ewes. However, a bolus injection of epinephrine decreases uterine blood flow significantly."}
{"answers": "These data indicate that major blunt trauma enhances the migratory capacity of circulating neutrophils. This is manifest within 2 hrs of admission and may be attributable to alteration in interleukin-8 receptor expression, affinity, or downstream signaling. In patients who later develop ARDS, initially elevated circulating neutrophil counts decrease rapidly, over the same time course. Early enhanced neutrophil migratory activity coupled with elevated pulmonary concentrations of interleukin-8 may be central to the establishment of the neutrophil infiltration that is characteristic of ARDS.", "prediction_text": "This study provides evidence that enhanced neutrophil migratory activity in response to interleukin-8 in the early post-trauma phase is associated with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Neutrophils from major trauma patients exhibited increased migration to interleukin-8 compared to normal volunteers, suggesting a role in the etiology of ARDS."}
{"answers": "Memory provocation increased the sensitivity of rCBF-SPECT for the detection of AD-related blood flow changes in the brain at the group level. Further studies are needed to evaluate MP-SPECT as a diagnostic tool at the individual level. If a higher sensitivity for AD at the individual level is verified in future studies, a single MP-SPECT study might be sufficient in the clinical setting.", "prediction_text": "Memory-provoked rCBF-SPECT identifies a significant reduction in left parietal cortex blood flow in Alzheimer's disease patients compared to healthy elderly, improving diagnostic sensitivity."}
{"answers": "1. DBE is a safe and and accurate method to diagnose small bowel disorders; 2. this method permits chromoscopy, biopsies and treatment of the lesions.", "prediction_text": "Yes, double-balloon enteroscopy achieved a diagnostic yield of 75% (33/44 cases) for small-bowel disorders."}
{"answers": "Reorganization of care to offer a primary angioplasty service was acceptable to patients and their carers. Satisfaction levels were high regardless of the type of care received, with the exception of discharge and aftercare.", "prediction_text": "The study found that patient satisfaction with primary angioplasty was higher for speed of treatment compared to thrombolysis. However, carers reported lower convenience at primary angioplasty sites. Overall satisfaction with care was similar between the two groups, and patient satisfaction with discharge and aftercare was lower for both. The study suggests that primary angioplasty is an acceptable alternative to thrombolysis, but it may come with added inconvenience for carers."}
{"answers": "The leukocyte count at presentation can be used as an adjunct in the evaluation of the severity of injury in blunt trauma patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the leukocyte count is positively correlated with injury severity score (ISS), but negatively correlated with Glasgow coma score (GCS) and revised trauma score (RTS)."}
{"answers": "Right ventricular recovery following PVR for chronic significant pulmonary regurgitation after repair of TOF may be compromised in the adult population. In order to maintain adequate RV contractility, pulmonary valve implant in these patients should be considered before RV function deteriorates.", "prediction_text": "The study found no significant change in RV volume and function after pulmonary valve replacement in adults late after repair of tetralogy of Fallot. However, only half of the patients with pre-operative ejection fraction >0.40 maintained this level post-operatively, while only 13% of those with pre-operative ejection fraction <0.40 reached this threshold post-operatively. These findings suggest that optimal surgical timing may be important for preserving RV function in this patient population."}
{"answers": "Combined approach tympanoplasty (CAT) allows for successful treatment of cholesteatoma with rates of recurrent and residual disease comparable to open mastoid surgery. Early timing of second-look procedures allows easier removal of any recurrent or residual disease, which reduces the conversion rate to open mastoidectomy.", "prediction_text": "The study reports a cholesteatoma recurrence rate of 19.7% after primary CAT surgery, with only 3% requiring conversion to modified radical mastoidectomy. The majority of recurrent and residual disease was easily removed at second-look surgery. However, the paper does not provide direct evidence that early second-look tympanoplasty reduces the conversion rate to modified radical mastoidectomy."}
{"answers": "In 1995, the first year that the MQSA was in effect, there was a significant improvement in the quality of mammography in North Carolina. This improvement probably resulted from facilities' compliance with federal regulations.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the Mammography Quality Standards Act of 1992 led to significant improvements in mammography quality in North Carolina, as evidenced by increased passing rates for phantom scores (from 31.6% to 78.2%), darkroom fog (from 74.3% to 88.5%), and temperature difference (from 62.4% to 86.9%)."}
{"answers": "HIE was associated with reduced repeat imaging in EDs. This study is among the first to find empirical support for this anticipated benefit of HIE.", "prediction_text": "Yes, according to this study, health information exchange was associated with a significant reduction in repeat imaging for computed tomography, ultrasound, and chest x-rays in emergency departments, reflecting reductions of 44%-67% relative to sample means."}
{"answers": "Gestational age misclassification is an unlikely explanation for the reported divergence in average birth-weights for Aborigines and whites. The results might help with the interpretation of other between-population comparisons.", "prediction_text": "The study found that at full term and for the 10th centiles, gestational age misclassification did not significantly explain the difference in birthweights between Australian Aborigines and whites. However, at preterm and for the 90th centiles, even minor misclassification had a significant impact, suggesting that gestational age misclassification may contribute to some extent to the observed difference. However, extreme types of misclassification were required to fully account for the divergence in median birthweights."}
{"answers": "W-d HCCs were clinically demonstrated not to be early cancer, because there was no significant difference in disease free survival between the patients with w-d and l-d HCCs.", "prediction_text": "Although well differentiated small hepatocellular carcinomas have a lower incidence of fibrous capsule formation compared to less differentiated HCCs, there are no significant differences in disease-free survival or other clinical outcomes such as intrahepatic metastasis or portal vein invasion. The presence of minute cancerous foci at the time of operation suggests that well differentiated HCC may not be truly clinically early cancer."}
{"answers": "The incidence of post-tonsillectomy late haemorrhage in our study population was 1.78%. A statistically significant difference was found between night-time and day-time haemorrhages. Even though no significant distribution of haemorrhages per hour was observed, we underline that we recorded 32 (54.2%) events in 2 periods of the day: from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. and from 6 to 9 a.m.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that post-tonsillectomy late haemorrhages are more common in the night-time (71.2%), with a statistically significant difference compared to day-time haemorrhages (p=0.002)."}
{"answers": "Biased estimates of asthma severity may contribute to racially disparate asthma care. Interventions to improve physicians' assessments of asthma severity and patient-physician communication may minimize racial disparities in asthma care.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that black patients were more likely to have their asthma severity underestimated by physicians compared to white patients, which was associated with poorer quality asthma care."}
{"answers": "Many factors contribute to the erroneous reporting of hCG results, including (a) the complexity of hCG molecule and confusion of nomenclature on the various forms of hCG; (b) laboratory personnel's lack of awareness of the distinctions of the forms of hCG and failure to recognize the specificity of assays for their measurement; (c) lack of clarity and uniformity in manufacturers' reagent labeling; and (d) most product inserts' lack of information on the specificity of each method to the various forms of hCG.", "prediction_text": "No, some laboratories incorrectly report serum quantitative hCG results as either intact hCG or total beta hCG. (Error rates: 9.3% for reporting intact hCG as total beta hCG and 13.1% for reporting total beta hCG as intact hCG.)"}
{"answers": "This study has shown that mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons concerning a certain issue is not sufficient to lead to a change in practice.", "prediction_text": "Based on this study, mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons did not significantly reduce the use of prophylactic nasogastric decompression in elective colonic resections."}
{"answers": "These data suggest that either apoptosis is not involved in cell loss in MTS, or a very slow rate of cell demise may have precluded detecting TUNEL-positive neurons dying through apoptosis. Increased Bax expression and activation of caspases support the latter possibility.", "prediction_text": "Despite increased Bax expression and caspase activation, the study did not find evidence of apoptotic cell death in mesial temporal sclerosis based on the absence of DNA fragmentation or typical apoptotic nuclear changes."}
{"answers": "Golytely was more efficacious than MiraLAX in bowel cleansing, and was independently associated with both bowel prep quality (BBPS \u2265 7) and higher adenoma detection. Golytely should be used as first line for bowel prep for colonoscopy. Studies with larger populations are needed to confirm these results.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that Golytely was associated with a higher adenoma detection rate (26.2%) compared to MiraLAX (16.1%) in this patient population, although the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.091). However, on multivariate analysis, Golytely was more likely to be associated with both a better bowel preparation score (BBPS \u2265 7) and adenoma detection."}
{"answers": "Patient's age (>60 y) and large polyp size (>10 mm) were significant predictive factors for neoplastic GB polyps. GB polyps less than 10 mm in diameter do not require surgical intervention simply because they grow.", "prediction_text": "The growth rate of a gallbladder polyp does not reliably predict a neoplastic polyp, but older age and larger size are significant risk factors for neoplastic polyps."}
{"answers": "These data suggest that the R14C KCNQ1 mutation alone is insufficient to cause AF. Rather, we suggest a model in which a \"second hit\", such as an environmental factor like hypertension, which promotes atrial stretch and thereby unmasks an inherited defect in ion channel kinetics (the \"first hit\"), is required for AF to be manifested. Such a model would also account for the age-related increase in AF development.", "prediction_text": "A specific KCNQ1 mutation, R14C, is linked to familial atrial fibrillation and shows increased sensitivity to atrial stretch, suggesting a connection between genetic and environmental factors in the development of atrial fibrillation."}
{"answers": "The real-time PCR approach revealed promising results in pollen identification and quantification, even when analyzing pollen mixes. Future perspectives could concern the development of multiplex real-time PCR for the simultaneous detection of different taxa in the same reaction tube and the application of high-throughput molecular methods.", "prediction_text": "The study explores the feasibility of using real-time PCR as a rapid and accurate alternative to traditional morphologic identification methods for detecting and quantifying allergenic pollen taxa. The results demonstrate successful identification and quantification of pollen from three plant species using this approach, suggesting a potential new perspective for aerobiological monitoring."}
{"answers": "The Ambu SIB was able to accurately deliver targeted pressures across all three models from preterm to infant. The Neopuff infant resuscitator was unable to deliver the targeted pressures in the infant model developing clinically significant levels of inadvertent PEEP which may pose risk during infant resuscitation.", "prediction_text": "The Ambu self-inflating bag accurately delivers adequate and safe ventilation pressures in infants up to 10 kg, while the Neopuff T-piece resuscitator was unable to reach set peak inflation pressures and exhibited elevated positive end expiratory pressures in the infant model."}
{"answers": "This longitudinal study found no significant effect of menopausal transition on quality of life among Taiwanese women. The decline in the role limitations due to emotional problems was related to vasomotor symptoms.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, menopausal transition did not significantly affect the overall quality of life as measured by the eight domains of the Short Form-36 in multivariate regression analysis. However, vasomotor symptoms had a negative impact on role limitation due to emotional problems."}
{"answers": "The incidence of CPM is not increased in IVF/ICSI pregnancies compared with spontaneous conceptions. CPM probably does not account for the adverse perinatal outcomes following IVF/ICSI.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find a statistically significant difference in the incidence of confined placental mosaicism between IVF/ICSI pregnancies and spontaneous conceptions. Therefore, the evidence from this study does not support the hypothesis that confined placental mosaicism accounts for adverse perinatal outcomes in IVF pregnancies."}
{"answers": "For risk stratification in emergency surgical patients, it is essential to measure the APACHE II score before surgical treatment. Longitudinal APACHE II scoring reveals continuous improvement of the score in surviving patients but has no therapeutic relevance in the individual patient.", "prediction_text": "The APACHE II score calculated upon ICU admission in emergency surgical patients may not be an independent marker of physiological impairment due to its dependence on treatment effects and potential bias in evaluating treatment policies and patient comparability. The score's predictive value for mortality is questionable, particularly in long-term ICU patients."}
{"answers": "The methodologic weaknesses of the studies do not permit acceptance of increased risk of tubal pregnancy or infertility as a consequence of perforation of the appendix, so a causal relationship cannot be supported by the data currently available. Only a well-designed case-control study with unbiased ascertainment of exposure and adjustment for confounding variables will provide a definitive answer.", "prediction_text": "The literature review suggests a possible increased risk of tubal infertility (4.8, 95% CI 1.5-14.9) and ectopic pregnancy (1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.5) after appendiceal perforation, but the evidence is limited by recall bias and inadequate adjustment for confounding variables."}
{"answers": "Cancellous bone plays an important role in primary stability of mini-implants in the presence or absence of cortical bone.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the research paper found that lower trabecular bone mineral density and the absence of cortical bone are associated with lower primary stability of miniscrews. Additionally, there is a correlation between trabecular properties such as trabecular number, thickness, bone volume density, and bone mineral density, and primary stability as measured by insertion torque, mini-implant mobility, and pull-out strength. Cortical thickness also correlates with primary stability."}
{"answers": "Despite recent efforts, a large proportion of newly confirmed TB patients could not adhere to standard TB treatment, and patients' lost to follow-up was still a serious problem. Poor treatment supervision and heavy financial burden might be the main causes for non-adherence. More needs to be done to enhance treatment supervision policies and financial supports to both health providers and TB patients.", "prediction_text": "Based on the study, 36.0% of newly confirmed TB patients in western China were non-adherent to their prescribed treatments, with factors including lack of family member observation and high monthly service expenses increasing the risk of non-adherence."}
{"answers": "While not providing conclusive evidence, this single institution experience suggests that neoadjuvant chemotherapy for Stage IV NPC patients improves both survival and disease control. Recurrence within the irradiated volume was the most prevalent mode of failure and future studies will evaluate regimens to enhance local regional control.", "prediction_text": "The study shows that among Stage IV nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients, those who received induction chemotherapy had lower 5-year freedom from relapse and local control rates compared to those who did not (37% vs. 64% and 56% vs. 86%, respectively, p = 0.01 and p = 0.009). However, the overall 5-year survival rate was higher in the induction chemotherapy group (56% vs. 68%, p = 0.02). The actuarial 5-year distant failure rate in patients with undifferentiated NPC who were treated with induction chemotherapy"}
{"answers": "There was increased expression of TGF-\u03b21 and VEGF in polyps compared to adjacent normal endometrial tissue. It suggested that these cytokines might play a role in endometrial polyp formation. In addition, there was a significant correlation between steroid receptor expression and VEGF and TGF-\u03b21 expression.", "prediction_text": "Yes, endometrial polyp formation is associated with increased expression of both Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and Transforming Growth Factor-beta1 (TGF-\u03b21) in glandular and stromal cells, particularly in the proliferative phase. The study also found a correlation between steroid receptor expression and VEGF and TGF-\u03b21 expression."}
{"answers": "Primary eosinophilic esophagitis is characterized by fragile esophageal mucosa that readily tears in response to minor trauma during otherwise uneventful diagnostic endoscopy. This \"cr\u00eape-paper\" sign may alert endoscopists to the presence of the disease when other mucosal alterations are lacking. Dilation is effective for patients with symptoms with minimal morbidity, despite development of disquieting lesions in response to the procedure.", "prediction_text": "The fragility of the esophageal mucosa, described as \"cr\u00eape-paper\" mucosa, may be a pathognomonic endoscopic sign of primary eosinophilic esophagitis, as reported in a series of cases where all patients with this condition experienced extremely fragile and inelastic mucosa that tore easily during dilation procedures, and remained asymptomatic for several months after the procedure."}
{"answers": "Preoperative platelet count is a predictive factor for long-term survival in ESCC, especially in nodal-positive patients. We conclude that 205 (\u00d710(9)/L) may be the optimum cutoff point for platelet count in predicting survival in ESCC patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, preoperative platelet count is a prognostic factor in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. A platelet count of \u2264205 (\u00d7 10(9)/L) was associated with a significantly better 5-year survival than a platelet count >205 in patients with positive lymph nodes (P = 0.004). Independent prognostic factors included platelet count, T grade, and N staging."}
{"answers": "From this study we conclude that there is no increase in testicular atrophy in patients less than 13 months.", "prediction_text": "The study found that an intraabdominal location was associated with increased testicular atrophy after orchiopexy, but age at the time of surgery was not statistically significant in predicting testicular atrophy after adjusting for location. The highest rate of atrophy was observed in testes orchiopexied between 13-24 months of age."}
{"answers": "The results suggest that a longer duration of treatment may prevent return into mental health care in some groups. However, because of the design of the study, no causal inference can be drawn. Further research, preferably in a RCT, is needed to determine whether the trend towards lower intensity treatments is associated with repeated mental health care use.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that patients with shorter durations of psychological treatment for depression were more likely to return for additional treatment episodes. Specifically, patients with treatment durations between 5-250 minutes, 251-500 minutes, and 751-1000 minutes had higher hazard ratios for returning to treatment compared to those with treatment durations over 1000 minutes."}
{"answers": "Written information sheets contribute to the process of informed consent. As patients' recall of information is generally poor, the sheets may also be useful medicolegally, as a permanent record of what was discussed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, according to the study, patients who received a written information sheet for informed consent of total hip arthroplasty scored significantly higher in recalling the given information compared to those who received only verbal information (48% vs. 38% correct answers)."}
{"answers": "Although theoretically plausible, bicompartmental knee arthroplasty was not superior in knee muscle strength and physical performance at 1 year compared with total knee arthroplasty.", "prediction_text": "The study found no significant difference in knee muscle strength and physical performance between bicompartmental knee arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty at any time point. Both procedures showed improvement in physical performance, with bicompartmental knee arthroplasty preserving muscle strength and position sense equally to unicompartmental knee arthroplasty and allowing for faster recovery. However, the TKA group showed an enhancement in stair climbing test performance."}
{"answers": "These results indicate that T-cell deficiency may affect spatial learning performance following toluene exposure.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that T-cell deficiency in nude mice does not significantly impact spatial learning ability following toluene exposure, but WT mice exposed to high toluene concentrations show poorer retention memory compared to controls."}
{"answers": "Histology usually demonstrated moderate to severe inflammation when VLEM were present. VLEM may be a highly specific endoscopic feature of esophagitis in children.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the presence of vertical lines in distal esophageal mucosa (VLEM) is strongly associated with esophagitis in children, particularly eosinophilic esophagitis, with a high specificity and moderate sensitivity."}
{"answers": "At the gas flows studied, HFNC are not noisier than BCPAP for preterm infants.", "prediction_text": "Based on the research paper, there is no significant difference in average noise levels between high flow nasal cannulas and bubble CPAP at the external auditory meatus for preterm infants. However, high flow nasal cannas are quieter than bubble CPAP at low frequency (500 Hz). Noise levels increase with increasing gas flows for both types of devices, but only significantly so for bubble CPAP."}
{"answers": "Patients with a history of ACD are at an increased risk of having recurrent preterm birth and cervical shortening in a subsequent pregnancy compared with women with prior preterm birth associated PPROM or PTL.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the clinical presentation of a prior preterm birth, specifically advanced cervical dilation, is associated with a higher risk of recurrent preterm birth compared to preterm premature rupture of membranes or preterm labor. Additionally, women with a history of advanced cervical dilation have shorter cervical lengths prior to 24 weeks and deliver earlier than those with other clinical presentations."}
{"answers": "This illustrates that Paget's disease does exist in India and a high index of suspicion is required to clinch the diagnosis.", "prediction_text": "Yes, Paget's disease is present in India as evidenced by this study of 21 patients, with a mean age at presentation of 49.2 years, a male to female ratio of 2.5:1, and common clinical manifestations including backache, headache, bone pains, and polyostotic involvement. Mean serum alkaline phosphatase levels decreased significantly after bisphosphonate treatment."}
{"answers": "The results of the present study show that idiopathic incidental misty mesentery appearance has a significant prevalence. Also, the high body mass index of these patients and the growing evidence of obesity-induced inflammatory changes in adipose tissue are suggestive of an association between obesity and misty mesentery appearance on CT.", "prediction_text": "The prevalence of incidentally detected idiopathic misty mesentery on multidetector computed tomography was 7%. Obesity was the most common indication for CT examination and was present in 67.5% of all patients."}
{"answers": "Percutaneous ethanol injection without aspiration of ethanol-mixed fluid seems to be the preferable method of treatment of benign cystic thyroid nodules from the perspective of both the physician and the patient.", "prediction_text": "The study found no statistical difference in the success rates of complete disappearance of benign cystic thyroid nodules between percutaneous ethanol injection with and without aspiration of ethanol-mixed fluid. However, aspiration was associated with more intracystic hemorrhage and longer procedure time due to additional procedures."}
{"answers": "The present study, which is based on internationally accepted assessment tools for SLE patients, shows a significant relationship between increased disease activity and reduced physical function. This result emphasizes the importance of optimizing treatment aiming at reducing disease activity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, increased disease activity as measured by the BILAG index was associated with reduced physical function, while greater damage as measured by the SLICC/ACR damage index (SDI) was associated with reduced role function due to emotional limitations in SLE patients. Age and disease duration did not show any significant correlation with health status."}
{"answers": "The morbidity associated with desmoid tumors has not been shown to differ, whether they arise after restorative proctocolectomy or ileorectal anastomosis.", "prediction_text": "The study found no significant difference in the clinical course, morbidity, or requirement for stoma between patients with intra-abdominal desmoid disease following ileal pouch-anal anastomosis and those with ileorectal anastomosis. The overall complication rate and individual complications were similar in both groups. However, the study was limited by the relatively small number of patients."}
{"answers": "These findings provide evidence for the existence of a high-IQ variant of schizophrenia that is associated with markedly fewer negative symptoms than typical schizophrenia, and lends support to the idea of a psychosis spectrum or continuum over boundaried diagnostic categories.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that schizophrenia patients with high pre-morbid intelligence and minimal post-onset IQ decline present with lower negative and disorganized symptoms, better global functioning, and insight compared to typical schizophrenia patients. They also show higher levels of manic symptoms. These findings indicate that high-intelligence schizophrenia may represent a clinically distinct subtype."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that hearing loss caused by GM otic drops may be reduced by the inclusion of BM and benzalkonium chloride. Our finding that BM alone was associated with hearing loss suggests that the benzalkonium chloride may be the protective agent in combination otic drops.", "prediction_text": "The study found that betamethasone, when given with otic gentamicin, did not significantly reduce cochlear toxicity as indicated by similar hearing loss in the treated and untreated ears."}
{"answers": "A fetal anatomic survey on follow-up sonograms may identify unanticipated fetal anomalies, especially when the indication is for fetal growth.", "prediction_text": "Yes, fetal anatomic assessment on follow-up antepartum sonograms can identify unanticipated fetal anomalies, leading to increased neonatal interventions compared to follow-up sonograms for other reasons. (12.3% vs. 3.5%, P = .01)."}
{"answers": "Patients with BRAF-mutant PTC had a significantly longer PFS than BRAF wild-type when treated with TKIs. However, due to the small number of BRAF-mutant patients, further investigations are required, especially to understand the potential positive effect of BRAF mutations in RAIR TC patients while having a negative prognostic impact in RAI-sensitive PTC patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the presence of a BRAF mutation in radioiodine-refractory thyroid cancers is associated with improved progression-free survival on tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment. However, PDTC histologic subtype is an independent prognostic factor for poorer outcomes."}
{"answers": "The frequency and topographic distribution of LNM are not modified by NACT, and clinical non-responders showed more involved LNs. A systemic and extensive lymphadenectomy should be performed in patients treated with NACT plus surgery regardless of the response to NACT.", "prediction_text": "The study found no significant difference in the topographical distribution of lymph node metastasis between patients who underwent surgery with or without neoadjuvant chemotherapy. However, the incidence of lymph node metastasis was decreased in the chemotherapy-responsive group compared to the non-responsive group. The number of lymph nodes involved, response to chemotherapy, tumor histology, and a positive vaginal margin were independent factors affecting disease-free survival or overall survival in node-positive patients. The study did not directly address the question of whether the extent of lymphadenectomy could be modified by neoadjuvant chemotherapy."}
{"answers": "A prior benign prostate biopsy may be independently associated with more favorable surgical and biochemical outcomes after prostatectomy. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings.", "prediction_text": "Yes, prior benign prostate biopsy is associated with more favorable pathologic features and a lower probability of biochemical failure in patients undergoing radical perineal prostatectomy for prostate cancer."}
{"answers": "This clinical trial evaluated the possible reduction in intervention-related myocardial damage that was attributable to remote postischemic conditioning.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that remote ischemic postconditioning may reduce myocardial lesions associated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), but its protective effect might be less pronounced in diabetic patients. The trial involving 320 patients showed that three cycles of ischemia in the non-dominant arm did not significantly affect the maximum troponin increase in the first 24 hours. However, there was a trend towards reduced readmission due to heart failure or cardiovascular mortality after 1 year in the postconditioning group, although this difference was not statistically significant overall. The study's findings indicate that remote ischemic postconditioning may offer some protection against ischemic damage during PCI"}
{"answers": "These results indicate that prophylactic treatment with edaravone prevents I/R-induced ovarian damage during pneumoperitoneum in an experimental rat model.", "prediction_text": "Edaravone administration in rats before ischemia/reperfusion injury significantly prevented ovarian degenerative changes, reduced caspase-3 expression, and attenuated oxidative stress as indicated by decreased malondialdehyde levels and increased total antioxidant capacity."}
{"answers": "Sonography has no place in the diagnosis of undescended testis.", "prediction_text": "Ultrasonography has limited accuracy in detecting undescended testes in boys, as it may miss retractile testes and falsely identify other structures as testes. However, it can be useful in identifying abdominal testes in cases of no palpable testis during clinical examination."}
{"answers": "Mammographic density is not associated with an increased need for re-excision or resection of unnecessary margins at initial BCS.", "prediction_text": "The study found no consistent association between mammographic density and margin re-excision rate after breast-conserving surgery in the multivariate analysis. However, the trend toward requiring more frequent re-excision in patients with denser breasts was not statistically significant. The rate of unnecessary margins did not differ by breast density. The re-excision rates increased with DCIS and decreased with resection of additional margins."}
{"answers": "Septal suturing after septoplasty offers the following advantages: elimination of discomfort for the patients, minimal complications, the outcome is almost the same as with nasal packing, and finally the hospital stay is less than with nasal packing. Therefore, suturing of the nasal septum after septoplasty should be a preferred alternative to nasal packing.", "prediction_text": "Based on the study, both suturing and nasal packing have similar rates of minor oozing, postoperative adhesions, and remnant deviated nasal septum. However, nasal packing was associated with a higher risk of bleeding after removal and septal hematoma. The operating time was slightly longer with suturing. Therefore, suturing may be considered an alternative to nasal packing with fewer risks of bleeding complications."}
{"answers": "The present study does not support the recommendation of ultrasound as a conclusive diagnostic tool for internal derangements of the temporomandibular joint.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that while articular sounds and physical signs are insufficient for detecting disk displacement in the temporomandibular joint, high-resolution ultrasound has lower sensitivity compared to magnetic resonance imaging. Technical difficulties due to bone structures limit its use."}
{"answers": "Our results showed that the serum leptin level has no prognostic indications in advanced lung cancer patients. Leptin is decreased in lung cancer, and there is lack of correlation with tumour\u2011related factors including prognosis. Therefore, leptin is not a useful clinical marker in lung cancer (Tab. 2, Fig. 2, Ref. 22).", "prediction_text": "The research paper did not find a significant association between serum leptin levels and overall survival in advanced lung cancer patients."}
{"answers": "We found no evidence of serovar specific immunity in our population. It remains possible that populations with a higher prevalence of gonorrhoea and more frequent infections may have a quantitatively greater immune response.", "prediction_text": "The study found no evidence of serovar-specific immunity to Neisseria gonorrhoeae based on the analysis of recurrent infections, as there was no significant difference in the prevalence of serovars isolated following a repeat infection compared to those without repeat infections."}
{"answers": "BPPV is associated with positive viral serology, particularly during certain months of the year, mainly in spring and autumn. Viral infection might promote BPPV attacks due to the development of vestibulopathy or induce secondary BPPV via viral infection-related neurolabyrinthitis.", "prediction_text": "The study found that serologic values for HSV1, Herpes zoster, adenovirus, EBV, CMV, and HSV2 were higher in patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) compared to healthy controls, except for influenza and parainfluenza. Seasonal variation was also observed, with increased values in BPPV patients for HSV1 and adenovirus in March and May, Herpes zoster, adenovirus, and influenza in April, HSV1 in June, and HSV1 and CMV in September, and all viruses in October. These findings suggest a potential role for viral infections in"}
{"answers": "We found increased post-ictal serum cytokine levels in patients with several epilepsy syndromes.", "prediction_text": "The study found elevated serum levels of IL-1, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-gamma in patients with epilepsy or new onset seizure compared to healthy controls. CSF analysis confirmed the presence of IL-6 and IL-1 in some patients. Correlations were noted between certain factors and specific cytokines. During the seizure-free period, there was a decrease in cytokine levels. These findings suggest a role for cytokines in epilepsy."}
{"answers": "Neuromedin U reduces insulin and increases somatostatin secretion. Blockade of somatostatin action abolishes the inhibition of insulin secretion by NmU. The results of the study suggest that somatostatin mediates the inhibitory action of NmU on insulin secretion.", "prediction_text": "Yes, somatostatin mediates the insulinostatic effects of Neuromedin U in the rat pancreas, as evidenced by increased insulin secretion and reduced NmU-induced inhibition of insulin secretion upon blocking paracrine somatostatin effects with cyclosomatostatin."}
{"answers": "Patients with fewer or anterior sutures have shorter OR times. However, 30-day readmission, band-related reoperation, and postoperative weight loss were unaffected by number or location of suture. The technical aspects of HHR did not appear to be associated with readmission or reoperation, and therefore a standardized approach may not be necessary.", "prediction_text": "The number and location of sutures for hiatal hernia repair during laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding do not significantly affect length of stay, 30-day readmission, band-related reoperation, or postoperative BMI/%EWL. However, patients with fewer sutures had a shorter operating room time, and those with anterior suture placement had a shorter operating room time and shorter length of stay compared to posterior or both placements."}
{"answers": "Survivors of lobar ICH with atrial fibrillation should not be offered long-term anticoagulation. Similarly, most patients with deep hemispheric ICH and atrial fibrillation should not receive anticoagulant therapy. However, patients with deep hemispheric ICH at particularly high risk for thromboembolic stroke or low risk of ICH recurrence might benefit from long-term anticoagulation.", "prediction_text": "The research suggests that for patients with a history of intracerebral hemorrhage and a clear indication for anticoagulation such as nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, the decision to anticoagulate should be carefully considered. In the absence of clinical trial data, the study used a decision-analysis model and found that for patients with prior lobar hemorrhage, withholding anticoagulation was preferred, while for those with prior deep hemispheric hemorrhage, the gain was smaller but anticoagulation could be considered if the risk of thromboembolic stroke is particularly high."}
{"answers": "This study showed that FDG is not a good surrogate tracer for tumor hypoxia under either ambient or hypoxic conditions. Only specific hypoxia tracers should be used to measure tumor hypoxia.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that under normoxic conditions, there is a moderate similarity between (14)C-EF3 and (18)F-FDG tracer distributions in tumors using PET and autoradiography. However, under hypoxic conditions, the similarity decreases, indicating that (18)F-FDG may not be an ideal surrogate tracer for measuring tumor hypoxia based on this specific comparison with (14)C-EF3."}
{"answers": "A task-specific intervention designed to improve gait speed may potentially provide secondary benefits by positively impacting depression, mobility and social participation for people post stroke.", "prediction_text": "The study found no significant difference between treadmill training and weekly phone calls in terms of depression, mobility, and social participation for individuals in the chronic stage of stroke recovery. However, treadmill training showed significant improvements in depression, mobility, and social participation compared to baseline."}
{"answers": "Orthostatic myoclonus is often underdiagnosed and can be considered a possible cause of unsteadiness in subjects with neurodegenerative diseases. Electromyography surface recording is thereby an aid for investigating unsteadiness of unknown origin.", "prediction_text": "Orthostatic myoclonus was the most common cause of unexplained unsteadiness in this study, affecting 17.2% of subjects, and was often associated with neurodegenerative diseases. All patients with OM reported unsteadiness during orthostatism and/or gait, and some experienced leg jerking and falls. Four patients showed improvement with antimyoclonic treatment, but follow-up was not systematic."}
{"answers": "Severely injured patients treated at a level III center had a higher mortality rate than those treated at a level I center. Most problems identified occurred in the emergency department and were related to delays in care provision. This research highlights the importance of efficient prehospital, in-hospital, and regional trauma systems, performance monitoring, peer review, and adherence to protocols and guidelines.", "prediction_text": "This study found that severely injured adult trauma patients in an Australian health service who were admitted to a level III trauma center had a significantly higher risk of death compared to those admitted to a level I trauma center, despite similarities in age, sex, ISS, and prehospital time. The increased risk of death at the level III center was attributed to issues with care delivery, including technical errors, delays in decision making, and errors of judgement."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that very few genes, which change their expression level during the WOI, show a quantitative homogeneous expression in endometrially-receptive patients. In conclusion, in this study only six genes showed a homogeneous expression, and are probably involved in embryo implantation mechanisms.", "prediction_text": "Among the 43 analyzed genes during the implantation window in women who became pregnant in a subsequent ICSI cycle, only six genes (VEGFA, PLA2G2A, ALPL, LIF, NNMT, and STC1) showed a statistically uniform expression."}
{"answers": "While SSA would be the first region to experience the huge benefits of implementing the \"test and treat\" policy of the WHO, the region is not yet prepared to manage the consequential increased burden of ART-related toxic and metabolic complications. Urgent measures should be taken to fill the lacunae if SSA is not to become over-burdened by the consequences of the \"test and treat\" policy.", "prediction_text": "Sub-Saharan Africa, with its weak health systems and high prevalence of ART-related adverse effects, faces significant challenges in coping with the increased incidence of these conditions resulting from the WHO's \"test and treat\" policy. The region's poverty, inadequate health services, and lack of data on predictive factors and burden of ART-related adverse effects hinder effective prevention and response planning."}
{"answers": "In summary we believe sudden onset chest wall rigidity may be a significant and previously unreported factor leading to an increased mortality, from illicit IV fentanyl use. Fentanyl and norfentanyl ratios and concentrations suggest a more rapid onset of death given the finding of fentanyl without norfentanyl in many of the fatalities. Chest wall rigidity may help explain the cause of death in these instances, in contrast to the typical opioid-related overdose deaths. Intravenous heroin users should be educated regarding this potentially fatal complication given the increasingly common substitution and combination with heroin of fentanyl.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that acute chest wall rigidity may contribute to rapid fatalities from illicit fentanyl use, as indicated by the lack of detectable norfentanyl in over half of the cases and strikingly high fentanyl concentrations in some cases without norfentanyl detection."}
{"answers": "There appears to be no benefit in metformin co-treatment before and during IVF in women with PCO without any other features of PCOS. Clinical Trials.gov: NCT01046032.", "prediction_text": "The study found no significant difference in live birth rates or severe OHSS rates between women with PCO morphology without other features of PCOS and those receiving placebo during IVF treatment, despite both groups sharing endocrinological disturbances. Therefore, short-term metformin co-treatment does not appear to benefit this specific group of women."}
{"answers": "The study suggests that ventilating an adult patient is possible with a smaller, pediatric-sized BVM. The tidal volumes recorded with the pediatric BVM were more consistent with lung-protective ventilation volumes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, EMS providers can provide appropriate tidal volumes in a simulated adult-sized patient with a pediatric-sized BVM, as shown by a greater percentage of breaths delivered in the recommended range and lower median tidal volumes compared to an adult BVM."}
{"answers": "Our results suggest that colonoscopy does not affect the management of patients with acute diverticulitis nor alter the outcome. The current practice of a routine colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis, diagnosed by typical clinical symptoms and CT needs to be reevaluated.", "prediction_text": "The study found no significant difference in survival or management between patients who underwent colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis and those who did not. While no colonic malignancies were detected, 32% of patients had polyps, with only one being an advanced adenoma. No new diagnoses were made after colonoscopy. Therefore, the routine use of colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis does not appear to affect its management based on this study."}
{"answers": "Pretreatment ECG is of limited value for patients with an unremarkable cardiovascular history and a normal heart rate and blood pressure. Hypotension may occur during treatment.", "prediction_text": "The study identified 6.5% ECG abnormalities and 3 cases of family history of cardiovascular disease in first-degree relatives among 109 patients with infantile hemangiomas. No major complications occurred during beta-blocker therapy despite hypotension in 9 patients and 88 parents reporting side effects. While a limitation is the relatively small patient cohort, the study suggests that cardiovascular evaluations are important for identifying potential risks and monitoring patients during beta-blocker therapy for infantile hemangiomas."}
{"answers": "Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is a promising option for lifelong treatment of type 2 diabetes. It has the potential to improve or cure a selected spectrum of type 1 diabetes when performed early in the disease. Further animal model studies or randomized controlled trials are needed to support our conclusion.", "prediction_text": "Yes, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass has been shown to be highly effective in managing diabetes in obese patients with type 2 diabetes, and there is potential for its application in selected cases of type 1 diabetes. However, long-term outcomes and potential cure are still under investigation."}
{"answers": "Collectively, results suggest that behavioral adaptation to ESC is likely in certain drivers; however, its proven effectiveness in reducing the likelihood of being involved in a serious crash probably outweighs any potential increases in unsafe driving. To fully benefit from ESC, vehicle manufacturers are encouraged to market ESC-equipped vehicles in a realistic, safe manner. Driver training and safety organizations are also encouraged to provide balanced educational information about ESC to their members.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that some ESC drivers reported noticeable changes in their driving behavior since using the technology. However, not all drivers were aware of ESC or its benefits, indicating a need for continued education and awareness efforts."}
{"answers": "The results of the study demonstrate that when clinical supervision uses best practice principles, it can provide professional support for allied health workers, even during times of rapid organisational change.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that longer and more frequent clinical supervision sessions, as well as having a choice in the allocation of a clinical supervisor and having a completed clinical supervision agreement, are associated with higher perceived effectiveness of clinical supervision among allied health professionals. This may contribute to sustaining the workforce in the current healthcare landscape."}
{"answers": "Both 'economic/employment' and 'social/welfare' dimensions of social exclusion significantly influence suicide mortality among males. The influence of 'economic/employment' and 'social/welfare' dimensions of social exclusion on female suicide mortality is controversial. Social exclusion might be considered as a risk factor for suicide mortality in Europe.", "prediction_text": "Yes, both the 'economic/employment' and 'social/welfare' dimensions of social exclusion have a negative influence on suicide mortality in Europe for both males and females, with a stronger effect observed for the 'social/welfare' dimension among females."}
{"answers": "While ultrasound examination is inexpensive and easily done, it is not accurate enough for staging small penile cancers located at the glans penis. However, for larger tumors ultrasound can be a useful addition to physical examination by delineating reliably the anatomic relations of the tumor to structures such as the tunica albuginea, corpus cavernosum, and urethra.", "prediction_text": "Ultrasound can accurately assess invasion into the tunica albuginea of the corpus cavernosum in squamous cell carcinoma of the penis, but has limited ability to differentiate invasion into the corpus spongiosum or subepithelial tissue. It can provide accurate maximum tumor thickness measurements in some cases. Overall, ultrasound is a useful adjunct to clinical staging in squamous cell carcinoma of the penis."}
{"answers": "This study confirms that a large percentage of patients use metered-dose inhalers improperly. It also demonstrates a significant lack of understanding by health care providers of the proper use of metered-dose inhalers. Furthermore, this study supports the use of respiratory care practitioners in the outpatient setting, since they were the most proficient among all the health care providers in the proper use of metered-dose inhalers.", "prediction_text": "The study found that while respiratory care practitioners had the highest proficiency in using metered-dose inhalers, both house staff and nursing staff had a significant number of errors, and a considerable percentage of patients also had poor understanding and use of these inhalers."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrated that the regional or global apex of a given curve is the most rotated level in only a minority of the curves. The most rotated level may be as far as two levels from the global apex and one level from the regional apex.", "prediction_text": "In adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, the transverse apex (most rotated vertebra) and coronal apex (regional or global) do not always coincide, with a variability extending up to two levels for the global apex (95% confidence levels)."}
{"answers": "Generalization of the RCT sample was supported, because only 7.8% of Phenomenology subjects did not fit the RCT criteria. Nevertheless, because the RCT subjects were more severely ill, it is unclear if treatment findings from the RCT will be applicable to children with less severe mania.", "prediction_text": "The TEAM sample of child bipolar I disorder exhibited similar demographics and long episode duration to the Phenomenology sample, but had a higher prevalence of mania symptoms, ultradian rapid cycling, psychosis, and suicidality. These findings suggest that the TEAM sample may represent a more severe subgroup of child bipolar I disorder."}
{"answers": "Experts across Europe asserted the right to culturally sensitive health care for all immigrants. There is a broad consensus among experts about the major principles of good practice that need to be implemented across Europe. However, there also is some disagreement both within and between countries on specific issues that require further research and debate.", "prediction_text": "While there is a broad European consensus on many factors characterizing good practice in health care for immigrants, such as easy and equal access, culturally sensitive services, and respect towards migrants, discordance remains on issues like prioritizing cultural differences and consistent governance of health care services."}
{"answers": "Biochemical analysis of injured cervical intervertebral disks reveals the presence of inflammatory markers such as MCP, fragments of structural matrix proteins such as FAC, and a correlation with pH. Further evaluation of the FAC as a potential diagnostic biomarker or therapeutic target is warranted in the cervical spine.", "prediction_text": "The fibronectin-aggrecan complex was present in the cervical disk space of patients undergoing diskectomy for radiculopathy caused by disk herniation, as evidenced by a statistically significant correlation between the complex and MCP (P = .036) and between the complex and pH (P = .008)."}
{"answers": "Affect-regulated exercise to feel 'good' can be used in a training programme to regulate exercise intensity. This approach led to a 19% increase in time to reach ventilatory threshold, which is indicative of improved fitness.", "prediction_text": "The study found that training at an intensity that feels 'good' led to a significant improvement in fitness, as indicated by an increase in time to reach ventilatory threshold, in sedentary females over the course of an 8-week training program. However, the training intensities were in the lower range of recommended guidelines for cardiovascular health. The impact of affect-regulated exercise on overall physical health beyond fitness improvements is not clear from this study."}
{"answers": "In Southern Italy, hepatitis G virus infection is widespread among patients with chronic hepatitis, independently of parenteral risk factors. Its frequency in subjects with cryptogenic liver disease parallels that observed in hepatitis C virus chronic liver disease, thus ruling out an aetiologic role of hepatitis G virus. TT virus infection is uncommon in patients with cryptogenic or hepatitis C virus-related liver disease who do not have a history of parenteral exposure.", "prediction_text": "Hepatitis G virus was present in 26.1% of patients with cryptogenic chronic liver disease and 40% of those with hepatitis C virus-related chronic liver disease, with no significant difference between the two groups. TT virus-DNA was detected in 3 subjects, one with cryptogenic and two with hepatitis C virus-related chronic liver disease. The role of these viruses in the development of cryptogenic chronic liver disease requires further investigation."}
{"answers": "Our findings suggest that somatic complaints may represent one, but not necessarily the most important, risk factor for the subsequent development of depressive symptoms in women in nonclinical populations. The results also highlight the importance of including social variables in studies on women's depression as well as conducting additional research to further examine predictors of depressive symptoms in men.", "prediction_text": "In the RENO Diet-Heart Study, somatic complaints, as measured by the SCL-90-R somatization subscale, predicted subsequent symptoms of depression, as measured by the CES-D, in women, but were a less powerful predictor than income and age."}
{"answers": "Peak inspiratory pressure, PEEP, and ventilation index values could distinguish survivors from nonsurvivors by day 3. This may assist in early application of supportive nonconventional therapies in children with malignancy and ARDS.", "prediction_text": "This study identified that sepsis syndrome was common in children with malignancy and ARDS, and peak inspiratory pressure, positive end-expiratory pressure, and ventilation index values could predict survival within the first three days. From day 8, respiratory data, specifically efficiency of oxygenation as determined by PaO2/FIO2 and P(A-a)O2, were significant predictors of outcome."}
{"answers": "In this small study serum inhibin concentrations higher than those found in the early follicular phase one to two weeks after evacuation of a hydatidiform mole seemed to be specific for persistent trophoblastic disease. Further data are needed to confirm these promising results.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study shows that inhibin concentrations in serum and tissue are significantly higher in patients with hydatidiform mole than in normal pregnancies. After evacuation of the mole, inhibin concentrations in serum decline to normal levels, and none of the patients with undetectable inhibin post-evacuation developed persistent trophoblastic disease. Therefore, inhibin may be a useful marker for hydatidiform mole."}
{"answers": "The integration of whole-lesion dynamic data tends to improve specificity. However, no statistical significance backs up this finding.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that while the most suspect curve and curve-type distribution percentage have diagnostic accuracies of 76.7% and 80.2%, respectively, the combined dynamic data from CAD had the highest diagnostic accuracy (84.3%). However, the differences did not achieve statistical significance. Therefore, while whole lesion time curve distribution analysis may provide additional information, the significance of this information in the context of CAD diagnosis needs further investigation."}
{"answers": "The seemingly exaggerated traditional fear of anaphylaxis seems to discourage surgeons from more widely adopting minimal access techniques for the treatment of hydatid cyst.", "prediction_text": "Yes, according to the survey of 30 surgeons in northern Jordan, fear of anaphylaxis and/or dissemination is the primary reason (78%) given by surgeons for not adopting percutaneous and laparoscopic techniques for treating liver hydatid cysts."}
{"answers": "Grandmultiparous women had increased maternal and neonatal morbidity, and neonatal mortality even after controlling for confounders, suggesting a need for closer observation than regular multiparous patients during labor and delivery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, grandmultiparity is an independent risk factor for adverse perinatal outcomes such as abruptio placentae, preterm delivery, fetal macrosomia, neonatal death, postpartum hemorrhage, and blood transfusion. (OR and 95% CI provided in the paper)"}
{"answers": "No single data source is likely to provide a complete health profile for an individual. For women with depression in pregnancy and dispensed antidepressants, the hospital admission data do not adequately capture all cases.", "prediction_text": "Based on the study, there is a discrepancy between the identification of major depression in pregnancy using hospital admission records and dispensing claims data. Only about 13.6% of pregnant women identified by both methods were found to have overlapping records. The study suggests that around 16% of pregnant women may have major depression based on dispensing records, but this number may be an underestimation as many women with depression may not have it recorded in their hospital records. Therefore, while population health data can be a valuable resource for identifying major depression in pregnancy, the limitations of the data and linkage methodology need to be carefully considered to ensure accurate results."}
{"answers": "These data suggest a pattern of diagnostic stability over time for manic and mixed episodes in patients with bipolar disorder. Careful prospective studies of this issue are needed.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the distinction between manic and mixed episodes in bipolar disorder patients held true over an 11-year period, with a higher proportion of consistent episodes observed in patients compared to random simulations."}
{"answers": "The analyses show that structural characteristics of a practice are not associated with uptake of a new IT facility, but that its use may be influenced by post-graduate education in the relevant clinical condition. For this diabetes system at least, practice nurse use was critical in spreading uptake beyond initial GP enthusiasts and for sustained and rising use in subsequent years.", "prediction_text": "The number of diabetes-educated staff in a general practice was the only structural characteristic significantly associated with increased use of an IT innovation in primary care, as shown in the regression analyses."}
{"answers": "GAPS, a simple clinical score, is a better predictor of admission than triage nurses, unless the nurse is sure about the outcome, in which case their clinical judgement should be respected.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the objective GAPS score performed comparably to nurses in terms of discrimination and accuracy for predicting admission at triage. However, GAPS outperformed nurses in calibration and accuracy in the majority of cases where nurses were less certain of the outcome. When nurses' clinical certainty was high, their accuracy was excellent but similar to GAPS only in the minority of cases. Using GAPS but overruling it when clinical certainty was high significantly outperformed both methods."}
{"answers": "Our data showed no difference in 25(OH) D levels between normal children and those with CD when adjusted for body mass index.", "prediction_text": "Based on this study, there was no significant difference in vitamin D levels between prepubertal children with celiac disease and those without the condition. However, obese celiac disease patients had lower vitamin D levels than non-obese children without celiac disease."}
{"answers": "Granulomatous myelotoxicity and enteritis developed in a 21 year old female within 3 weeks of initiating sulfasalazine for rheumatoid arthritis. Following a short course of corticosteroids, the patient had resolution of her cholestatic hepatitis, rash, eosinophilia, and gastrointestinal symptoms with no residual manifestations at 7 months follow-up. Although severe reactions to sulfasalazine are rare and unpredictable, practicing physicians should be aware of unusual clinical presentations of toxicity when prescribing sulfasalazine.", "prediction_text": "The given case report describes a severe systemic reaction to sulfasalazine in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis, which included symptoms of eosinophilia, granulomatous enteritis, myelotoxicity, cholestatic hepatitis, and seizures. Crohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease, but the patient in this case report was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, it is unlikely that this was a case of Crohn's disease."}
{"answers": "Healthy lifestyles lead to an increase in the utilization of preventive health services. However, there is not much significantly reducing the number of outpatient visits in people with health behaviors. Specifically, people with regular exercise habits and who take their blood pressure measurement regularly have an increased number of outpatient visits. It is suggested that more available and accessible health consultation services be provided to inculcate in the general public the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle.", "prediction_text": "The study found that certain health behaviors, including exercise habits, dietary habits, regular blood pressure measurement, and drinking habits, have a significant correlation with healthcare utilization (P<0.05). However, the paper does not directly answer if healthier lifestyles lead to less utilization of healthcare resources as it only identifies the correlation between specific health behaviors and healthcare utilization."}
{"answers": "Parental restriction of R-rated movie viewing is associated with both lower adolescent smoking susceptibility and lower smoking rates.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that parental restriction of R-rated movie viewing is associated with a lower adolescent smoking susceptibility (r = -.36, p<.001). Specifically, students with partial or no restriction were more likely to be susceptible to smoking (partial restriction: OR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.5-2.8; no restriction: OR = 3.3, 95% CI = 2.3-4.6), as shown in hierarchical logistic regression analyses, even after controlling for demographic factors, family, and friend smoking. Similar results were obtained when smoking prevalence was used as the"}
{"answers": "Having a usual physician can be an effective tool in improving access to care for low-income populations, although it is most effective when combined with insurance coverage. However, the effectiveness of managed care in linking more low-income persons to a medical home is uncertain, and may have unintended consequences for uninsured persons.", "prediction_text": "The research suggests that high managed care penetration in low-income communities is associated with a lower likelihood of having a usual source of care for uninsured individuals."}
{"answers": "Locally 1.0% ropivacaine administration significantly relieves the pain of pediatric tonsillectomy and, it is a safe and effective method. High concentrations of ropivaciane may produce clinically significant pain relief. It is more effective to reduce of post-operative analgesic requirement after first hour.", "prediction_text": "Topical application of ropivacaine hydrochloride during tonsillectomy in pediatric patients does not significantly reduce morbidity in the first hour but shows statistically significant pain relief in later hours and days, as indicated by improved pain control. No differences were observed in other post-operative parameters such as nausea, fever, vomiting, odor, bleeding, otalgia, and trismus between the ropivacaine and control groups. No complications or systemic side effects related to ropivacaine hydrochloride were reported."}
{"answers": "Minimally invasive mitral valve repair using neochords provided a high rate of repair, reproducible results in a routine cardiac surgery setting and stable repair during follow-up. This has become our preferred technique for mitral valve surgery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, based on this study, minimally invasive mitral valve repair using artificial chords is a reproducible and applicable approach in routine surgery, with a high repair rate, low recurrent mitral regurgitation, and no reported de-insertion or rupture of neochords or reoperations."}
{"answers": "Comparisons of absolute EOA values grouped by the manufacturers' valve sizes are misleading because of specific differences in geometric dimensions. The EOA:patient aortic annulus area ratio provides a new hemodynamic index which may facilitate objective comparisons between different valve types.", "prediction_text": "The study found no significant difference in effective orifice area/patient aortic annulus area ratios between the Medtronic Mosaic and Edwards Perimount bioprostheses, suggesting that this ratio may be a useful method for comparing bioprostheses despite variations in patient anatomy and valve dimensions."}
{"answers": "Women compared to men often delay seeking treatment for an AMI, which further increases their risks. Our findings suggest specific characteristics that can serve as a profile to those African Americans most likely to delay seeking treatment for AMI.", "prediction_text": "The research paper did not provide significant evidence to conclude that there are gender differences in the reasons why African Americans delay in seeking medical help for symptoms of an acute myocardial infarction beyond what was mentioned in the given factors such as being single, alone at symptom onset, or having insurance coverage. The paper did find that women who received advice to seek help had shorter delays, while men who took an ambulance to the hospital had shorter delay times. However, the paper did not specifically investigate the reasons behind these differences between genders."}
{"answers": "A reduced alveolar macrophage phagocytic host response to apoptotic cells or NTHi may contribute to neutrophilic inflammation and NTHi colonization in both PBB and bronchiectasis. Whether this mechanism also contributes to the progression of PBB to bronchiectasis remains unknown.", "prediction_text": "The research paper suggests that children with protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) have lower alveolar macrophage phagocytic capacity for apoptotic cells and nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae compared to control subjects. This dysfunction is also observed in children with bronchiectasis, and both conditions are associated with neutrophilic inflammation and frequent isolation of NTHi. The study also found reduced mannose receptor expression and increased interleukin-1\u03b2 in both PBB and bronchiectasis groups, indicating a potential role in tissue damage and neutrophil persistence. These findings support the hypothesis that PBB may be a for"}
{"answers": "Cervical physical therapy can have a positive effect on subjective tinnitus complaints in patients with a combination of tinnitus and neck complaints. Larger studies, using more responsive outcome measures, are however necessary to prove this effect.", "prediction_text": "The study found that multi-modal cervical physical therapy led to significant improvements in tinnitus complaints and neck complaints in patients with cervicogenic somatic tinnitus after treatment. However, only 24% of patients maintained substantial improvement after a 6-week follow-up."}
{"answers": "Because workers may have an elevated relative aerobic workload for several hours each working day, this relationship may elucidate a mechanism behind the increased risk for cardiovascular disease among workers exposed to high levels of occupational physical activity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that a 1% increase in mean relative aerobic workload was associated with a significant increase in both systolic and diastolic ambulatory blood pressure (0.42 mmHg and 0.30 mmHg, respectively)."}
{"answers": "Our investigation did not undoubtedly prove that significant changes of fetal biometric parameters occurred in the last three decades. It is possible that secular growth acceleration does not exist in prenatal period but also the observed time period could have been short for this phenomenon to manifest.", "prediction_text": "Based on the given research, no statistically significant evidence was found to support the existence of secular growth acceleration during fetal life for the biometric parameters studied (biparietal diameter, fetal length, and abdominal circumference) between the contemporary fetal population and those from three decades ago."}
{"answers": "Consistent with prior studies, we found an inverse relationship between obesity and serum prostate specific antigen. However, the magnitude of the difference was small. Thus, adjusting prostate specific antigen for body mass index does not appear warranted.", "prediction_text": "The study found no significant association between body mass index and prostate specific antigen after adjusting for age in men without prostate cancer. A 10-point increase in body mass index was associated with a small decrease in prostate specific antigen (-0.03 ng/ml), but this association was not significant in various sensitivity analyses. Therefore, based on this study, it does not appear necessary to adjust prostate specific antigen for body mass index."}
{"answers": "Emergency laparotomy carries a high rate of mortality, especially in those over the age of 70 years, and more needs to be done to improve outcomes, particularly in this group. This could involve increasing acute surgical care manpower, early recognition of patients requiring emergency surgery, development of clear management protocols for such patients or perhaps even considering centralisation of emergency surgical services to specialist centres with multidisciplinary teams involving emergency surgeons and care of the elderly physicians in hospital and related community outreach services for post-discharge care.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study findings indicate higher 30-day and 1-year mortality rates in older adults undergoing emergency laparotomies, suggesting a need for improvement in care and prospective data collection. Specifically, the 30-day mortality was 12.4% for those under 70 and 22% for those over 70 (p<0.001), while 1-year mortality was 25.1% for those under 70 and 38% for those over 70 (p<0.001)."}
{"answers": "[corrected] This observation is exceptional in many aspects: very early age of onset of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, no immune deficit, association with a rare congenital neurological syndrome. We discuss the possible link between this entity and the occurrence of tuberculosis.", "prediction_text": "A case of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis in an immuno-competent child with probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome is reported. The causative link between this syndrome and tuberculosis requires further investigation."}
{"answers": "The signal intensity on DWI showed no significant difference in the development of vascularization.", "prediction_text": "The study found that there was no statistically significant difference in the cumulative development of vascularization among hypointense, isointense, and hyperintense hypovascular hepatocellular lesions on diffusion-weighted imaging. Therefore, DWI does not significantly indicate the development of vascularization in these lesions."}
{"answers": "General practitioners should consider using patients' first names more often, particularly with younger patients.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the majority of patients are accepting or neutral towards being called by their first names by doctors, but most patients do not want to call their doctors by their first names."}
{"answers": "Patients after ART treatment suffer from higher C-section rates during their stage of delivery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, according to this study, primiparae who conceived through ART, particularly those with fresh transferred embryos or slow freezing, have higher risks for both elective and emergency C-sections compared to spontaneous conception."}
{"answers": "Trauma patients have a significant complication rate related to anticoagulation therapy, and predicting which patients will develop a complication remains unclear. Prospective studies are needed to determine which treatment regimen, if any, is appropriate to safely anticoagulate this high risk population.", "prediction_text": "The study found that 21% of trauma patients on therapeutic anticoagulation experienced complications, with the most common complication being a sudden drop in hemoglobin concentration requiring blood transfusion. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, UH use, and a lower initial platelet count were identified as risk factors for complications. However, the use of unfractionated heparin versus fractionated heparin also differed between groups, which may have contributed to the observed differences. Overall, the study suggests that therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients carries a risk of complications, particularly in those with certain patient factors and those receiving unfractionated heparin."}
{"answers": "A significant difference in dental health between recruits to each Service does exist and is a likely to be a reflection of the sociodemographic background from which they are drawn.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that new recruits in the British Army had a significantly higher prevalence of dental decay and greater treatment resource need compared to new recruits in the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. Army recruits also disproportionately came from more deprived socioeconomic backgrounds."}
{"answers": "In light of the large sample size and prior pilot testing of presented images, results suggest that episodic migraineurs do not differentially attend to headache-related facial stimuli. Given modest evidence of attentional biases among chronic headache samples, these findings suggest potential differences in attentional processing between chronic and episodic headache subforms.", "prediction_text": "The study found no evidence of selective attention to headache-related visual stimuli in episodic migraineurs compared to non-migraine controls based on their reaction times in a computerized dot probe task."}
{"answers": "Under the conditions of this study, preclerkship (year 2) CPEs strongly predicted medical students at risk for failing a senior CPE. This finding opens the opportunity for remediation of deficits prior to or during clerkships.", "prediction_text": "Yes, students with low scores on preclerkship clinical performance examinations are at a higher risk of failing a senior clinical performance examination."}
{"answers": "Our results suggest that people do not attach a simple fixed premium to \"safety-related\" interventions but that preferences depend more subtly on context. The use of the results of such public preference surveys to directly inform policy would therefore be premature.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the public values health care interventions aimed at preventing hospital-acquired infections more highly when caused by the health care system, compared to interventions for genetic disorders or individual lifestyle choices. The study found that preventative interventions for hospital-acquired infections were valued at 1.31, while interventions for genetic disorders were valued at 1.0, and interventions for lifestyle choices were valued at 0.65."}
{"answers": "Minimising the radiation dose to one of the parotid glands with the help of IMRT in patients with advanced head and neck cancers can prevent xerostomia in most patients and parotid scintigraphy is a useful method of documenting xerostomia.", "prediction_text": "Partial sparing of one parotid gland to a mean dose of 26.85 Gy resulted in minimal xerostomia (grade I or II) in 17/19 patients at a median follow-up of 13 months. However, only two patients had a completely spared contralateral gland and both experienced no xerostomia (grade 0). These findings suggest that dose reduction to one parotid gland can help prevent or minimize xerostomia in head and neck cancer patients undergoing IMRT with or without chemotherapy."}
{"answers": "It is important to continue FA supplementation over the long term in patients on methotrexate and FA in order to prevent them discontinuing treatment because of mouth ulcers or nausea and vomiting. Our data suggest that FA supplementation is also helpful in preventing neutropenia, with very little loss of efficacy of methotrexate.", "prediction_text": "The study did not provide conclusive evidence that continuing folic acid supplementation in RA patients on methotrexate improves toxicity or decreases the risk of early discontinuation. However, there was an increased incidence of nausea in the placebo group at 9 months. The clinical significance of the observed differences in disease activity between groups is questionable."}
{"answers": "LF and cruroplasty is feasible and has good results in terms of GERD symptoms control and additional weight loss. The high rate of postoperative complications observed in this series remains a matter of concern. A re-sleeve procedure might be considered as an alternative to RYGB/DS conversion restricted to selected patients.", "prediction_text": "The retrospective study suggests that laparoscopic fundectomy is safe and effective in improving GERD symptoms and promoting additional weight loss in patients with a residual fundus or neofundus after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, with a low complication rate (10.5%)."}
{"answers": "VAT area measurement at a single level 3 cm above the lower margin of the L3 vertebra is feasible and can reflect changes in VAT volume and body weight. Advances in knowledge: As VAT area at a CT slice 3cm above the lower margin of L3 can best reflect interval changes in VAT volume and body weight, VAT area measurement should be selected at this location.", "prediction_text": "Yes, visceral adipose tissue area measurement at a slice 3 cm above the lower margin of L3 shows strong correlations with both visceral adipose tissue volume and body weight changes."}
{"answers": "Barrett's cytokeratin 7/20 pattern can be a useful marker for the diagnosis of short-segment Barrett's oesophagus, although the false positive or false negative rate is approximately 25%.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the Barrett's cytokeratin 7/20 pattern, defined as cytokeratin 20 positivity in the superficial gland and cytokeratin 7 positivity in both the superficial and deep glands, was observed in 77.8% of short-segment Barrett's oesophagus cases, 39.3% of intestinal metaplasia at the cardia cases, and 14.8% of gastric intestinal metaplasia cases. The sensitivity and specificity of this pattern were 77.8% and 77.5%, respectively, suggesting that cyt"}
{"answers": "In this paper the effect of lunar phases on the time of delivery is shown. This influence seems to be especially relevant in the case of multiparae and plurigravidae. Nevertheless, it is too weak to allow for prediction regarding the days with the highest frequency of deliveries.", "prediction_text": "The study found a connection between the distribution of spontaneous full-term deliveries and the lunar month, particularly in multiparae and plurigravidae, who tended to deliver meanwise on the first or second day after a full moon."}
{"answers": "Financial incentives for smoking cessation in pregnancy are highly cost-effective, with an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life years of \u00a3482, which is well below recommended decision thresholds.", "prediction_text": "The study found that financial incentives up to \u00a3400 for smoking cessation during pregnancy cost \u00a31127 per quitter from an NHS perspective, which is similar to previously published ICER values. The cost-utility analysis showed an incremental cost of \u00a317 (-\u00a393, \u00a3107) per QALY gained (0.04, -0.058, 0.145) with uncertainty due to relapse after birth. The expected value of perfect information was \u00a330 million, suggesting further research is warranted. Overall, the cost-effectiveness of financial incentives for smoking cessation during pregnancy is uncertain."}
{"answers": "This data demonstrates the robust nature of the short stay ward. At these two very different institutions we have shown improved bed efficient and patient care in a cost-effective way. We have also reported on greater parental satisfaction and early return of the child with their family to the community.", "prediction_text": "Yes, based on the data from the study, short stay or 23-hour wards in both the general and academic children's hospitals led to increased hospital efficiency, shorter length of stay, low rates of admission to in-hospital beds and unscheduled visits, and high parental satisfaction, with estimated savings of $1/2 million to $2.3 million for each hospital."}
{"answers": "Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery is a safe method of treatment in patients with Cushing's disease. Operative findings, radiological and histological findings, together with early postoperative serum cortisol and urine free cortisol estimates may identify failures in treatment. Alternative treatment might then be required for these patients. Because of the risk of late relapse, patients require life-long follow-up.", "prediction_text": "The study identified that the presence of a tumor at surgery and positive radiological and histological findings were significant predictors of remission in transsphenoidal pituitary surgery for Cushing's disease. Early postoperative serum cortisol and urine free cortisol levels also distinguished patients who failed treatment. However, some patients in the remission group required hormonal replacement therapy and a few underwent a second operation."}
{"answers": "Patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms have a great diversity of functional somatic symptoms. They use more somatic and psychotropic drugs than controls in the years before diagnosis. Moreover, they show high rates of referrals and psychiatric morbidity. The diversity of symptoms of patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms supports the concept that symptoms do not cluster in well defined distinct syndromes. Therefore, patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms should preferably not be classified into medical subspecialty syndromes.", "prediction_text": "Based on the research, patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms present with higher prevalence of symptoms in multiple body systems, increased medication use, more GP visits, greater psychiatric morbidity, and increased referrals to mental health workers and somatic specialists compared to controls, suggesting that chronic functional somatic symptoms may represent a complex, heterogeneous condition rather than a single syndrome."}
{"answers": "The vast majority of MDT decisions are implemented. Management alteration was most often due to patient choice or additional information available after the MDT. A minority of management alterations were 'unjustifiable' and the authors recommend that any patient whose treatment is subsequently changed should have MDT rediscussion prior to treatment.", "prediction_text": "In the studied time frame, 91.5% of multidisciplinary team decisions in breast cancer management were concordant with subsequent patient care. The remaining 8.5% were discordant, with 17.8% of these deemed unjustifiable and 82.2% justifiable due to patient choice, new information, or error."}
{"answers": "We found that 1.6% of S. aureus (all MSSA) from bacteraemic patients were PVL-positive. This low incidence suggests that PVL-positive S. aureus are of no particular significance as causative agents of S. aureus bacteraemia.", "prediction_text": "Out of 244 S. aureus bacteraemia isolates in the UK and Ireland during 2005, only 1.6% were PVL-positive and susceptible to oxacillin. No methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates were PVL-positive. The four PVL-positive cases were from three distinct strains and had infection foci in skin and soft tissue, unknown, indwelling line, and surgical site. Two isolates were related and came from Ireland."}
{"answers": "These findings are in accordance with previous experimental work and provide additional support for the assertion that dogs can prime autistic children for therapy. Ultimately, this study may contribute toward a change for full acceptance of canine-assisted therapy programs within the medical milieu. Additional studies using a similar research protocol on more autistic children will certainly help professionals to work on the most effective methods to individually serve this population through canine-assisted interventions.", "prediction_text": "Based on the research paper, the presence of a dog during therapy sessions for a child with autism spectrum disorder led to more frequent and longer durations of positive behaviors and less frequent and shorter durations of negative behaviors. Therefore, dogs may prime autistic children for therapy by facilitating a more positive and engaging therapeutic environment."}
{"answers": "We conclude that increased cardiovascular risk of the DD genotype is not mediated through insulin resistance or abnormalities in fibrinolysis. Conversely, we report an increased sensitivity in NIDDM subjects with the ACE DD genotype.", "prediction_text": "The DD genotype of the ACE I/D polymorphism is associated with lower insulin levels and increased insulin sensitivity in non-insulin-dependent diabetic subjects, suggesting a possible role in insulin resistance. However, no such association was found in nondiabetic subjects."}
{"answers": "A history of PIPE may be a risk factor for the development of IPE. Yet, the disappearance of significance on multivariate analysis indicates that it is not an independent predictor.", "prediction_text": "This retrospective study found that a history of postictal psychotic episodes was one of several variables associated with the development of interictal psychotic episodes in adults with partial seizure disorder in univariate analysis. However, this association disappeared after multivariate analysis, suggesting that other factors may play a more significant role. The study did not definitively establish that postictal psychotic episodes are predictive of interictal psychotic episodes."}
{"answers": "QTcD is significantly increased in hypertensive patients with LVH compared with those without, being strongly correlated with the indices of LVH. A QTcD cut-off value of 60 ms predicted LVH in hypertensive patients with a high sensitivity and specificity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that a corrected QT dispersion (QTcD) of 60 ms or more had a sensitivity of 92.9% and specificity of 98.2% in predicting left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in hypertensive patients. Hypertensive patients with LVH had significantly greater QTcD values than those without LVH, and QTcD was positively correlated with LVH indices."}
{"answers": "The shaving of the incision site immediately before spinal surgery may increase the rate of postoperative infection.", "prediction_text": "Yes, according to this study, shaving the incision site before spinal surgery increases the infection rate, as evidenced by a significantly higher infection rate in the shaved group (4 patients) compared to the unshaved group (1 patient) (P<0.01)."}
{"answers": "The majority of EMS professionals thought that they should participate in disease and injury prevention programs. The respondents were mixed as to whether prevention services should be provided while on emergency calls, but those with experience providing these services were more likely to agree with providing them during emergency calls.", "prediction_text": "Eighty-two percent of EMS professionals believe that they should participate in disease prevention, with those working 20 to 29 hours per week being the least likely to agree."}
{"answers": "Current K/DOQI guidelines are inadequate for correcting VDDI or secondary hyperparathyroidism in CKD patients. Future studies should examine the effects of higher or more frequent dosing of ergocalciferol on these clinical endpoints.", "prediction_text": "The study found that while ergocalciferol treatment led to significant increases in 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in CKD patients, only half of the patients reached sufficient levels (>50 nmol/l), and fewer than a quarter reached optimal levels (>75 nmol/l). Additionally, only a quarter of patients experienced a >30% decrease in iPTH levels. These findings suggest that current K/DOQI treatment guidelines for ergocalciferol may not be adequate for correcting vitamin D deficiency and hyperparathyroidism in CKD patients."}
{"answers": "Baseline pain intensity does not predict the outcome after an appropriate opioid titration. It is likely that non-homogeneous pain treatment would have biased the outcome of a previous work.", "prediction_text": "The study found no correlation between pain intensity at admission and poor opioid response in cancer patients. However, patients with poor opioid response had higher values of OEImg."}
{"answers": "Maintaining viral load suppression over time in resource-limited-settings is feasible.", "prediction_text": "In this retrospective study of HIV-infected patients in a resource-limited setting, 87.3% of those diagnosed in the pre-HAART era had undetectable viral loads after long-term treatment with HAART. However, 16.5% required third-line ART regimens, which were associated with a higher risk of virologic failures. These findings suggest that while maintaining viral load suppression is feasible in resource-limited settings, the risk of resistance and the need for more advanced treatment regimens remain concerns."}
{"answers": "Mucosal redundancy is a constant associated finding in IHPS. Although the origin of the redundancy and a cause-and-effect relationship are difficult to establish, our findings support the hypothesis that hypergastrinemia may be implicated in the pathogenesis of IHPS, and suggest that mucosal thickening could be implicated as one of the initiating factors in its development.", "prediction_text": "The study findings suggest that the pyloric mucosa in infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is thicker than normal, occupying about one third of the pyloric mass and obstructing the canal. This mucosal redundancy may contribute to the development of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, but the exact cause remains unclear."}
{"answers": "Given the available screening technologies, discordant TEOAE and AABR may be inevitable for some categories of hearing loss among apparently healthy newborns whose mothers received prenatal care. The potential limitations of perinatal morbidities as basis of targeted screening for such cases therefore merit further consideration.", "prediction_text": "The study identified that antenatal care attendance, mode of delivery, and nursery type were predictors of discordant TEOAE and AABR outcomes in newborns undergoing a two-stage hearing screening program. (c-statistic=0.73)"}
{"answers": "GM of CRC and SLM was associated with fewer procedures but did not influence overall survival. SM was associated with a longer delay and increased use of chemotherapy between procedures, suggesting that more rigorous selection of SM patients for surgery may explain the higher disease-free survival after SLM resection.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find a significant difference in three-month mortality or overall survival rates between global management and separate management of colorectal cancer with synchronous liver metastases. However, global management was associated with a lower mean number of procedures and more often involved the first step of liver resection during colorectal surgery. Delayed liver resection was more common in separate management, with a longer median delay between procedures and more frequent use of chemotherapy prior to liver surgery. Disease-free survival to 5 years was higher in separate management."}
{"answers": "epiDWI has the potential to differentiate pleomorphic adenoma and myoepithelial adenomas from all other examined entities. Due to an overlap not only within the group of benign and malignant lesions but also between groups, diagnoses should not be addressed on the basis of ADC values solely. Therefore, further studies combining DWI, morphologic criteria, and probably other MR imaging techniques seem warranted.", "prediction_text": "Echo-planar diffusion-weighted MR imaging can differentiate pleomorphic adenomas from other primary parotid gland tumors, specifically Warthin tumors, myoepithelial adenomas, lipomas, and salivary duct carcinomas, based on significant differences in apparent diffusion coefficients. However, it cannot distinguish between Warthin tumors and mucoepidermoid carcinomas, acinic cell carcinomas, and basal cell adenocarcinomas."}
{"answers": "The survey shows significant dissatisfaction amongst consultant radiologists with the current service, confirms a low number of paediatric radiologists taking on this work, and suggests the potential to increase numbers of radiology child abuse experts by 27% if given improved training and support. Appropriate service and education strategies should be implemented.", "prediction_text": "The study found that only 52% of UK radiology departments have a dedicated paediatric radiologist, and 25% of initial reports on skeletal surveys for child abuse were provided by non-paediatric radiologists. Over two-thirds of radiologists believed the service could be improved, and only 5% provided expert evidence. A significant proportion (73%) would never consider providing expert evidence despite adequate training. Therefore, the study suggests that radiologists may not be fully satisfied with their training and support in suspected child abuse cases."}
{"answers": "The enhancement of serum TNFalpha and IL-6 levels in the patients with ERCP-induced pancreatitis reflects the inflammatory activity. Additionally, these cytokines together with IL-4 can be used in clinical laboratory monitoring of ERCP.", "prediction_text": "The study found that patients with post-ERCP pancreatitis had significantly lower IL-4 levels and higher TNFalpha levels, as well as higher TNFalpha/IL-4 ratios at 12 and 24 hours after ERCP, compared to those without pancreatitis. Additionally, IL-6 was significantly increased in the complicated group at 24 hours after ERCP. These findings suggest that the imbalance between pro-inflammatory (TNFalpha) and anti-inflammatory (IL-4) cytokines, as well as the increase in IL-6, may reflect the inflammatory activity in post-ERCP pancreatitis."}
{"answers": "During the 5 years, 24% of Africans with optimal BP developed hypertension. The surge in hypertension in Africa is largely explained by modifiable risk factors. Public health strategies should focus aggressively on lifestyle to prevent a catastrophic burden on the national health system.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the research paper suggests that smoking and greater waist circumference are behavioral risk factors associated with the conversion from optimal blood pressure to hypertensive status in Black South Africans. Additionally, higher levels of \u03b3-glutamyltransferase and alcohol intake were also independent predictors of blood pressure changes."}
{"answers": "Our data have revealed a number of differences. Compared to the clinic sample, the Web-based sample had worse psychological symptom burden, younger average age, higher prevalence of employment, and a lower proportion on ART. For future research, we recommend that Web-based data collection should include the demographic variables that we note differed between samples. In addition, we recognize that each recruitment method may bring inherent sampling bias, with clinic populations differing by geographical location and reflecting those accessing regular medical care, and Web-based sampling recruiting those with greater Internet access and identifying survey materials through specific searches and contact with specific websites.", "prediction_text": "The Web-based sample of gay men living with HIV reported higher psychological symptom burden compared to the clinic sample, but there was no significant difference in physical symptom burden. Employment status was a significant predictor of both physical and psychological symptom burden in multivariable analyses."}
{"answers": "The majority of acetabular components in this cohort were stable despite the small contact surface achieved between the component and pelvic bone. Three of 10 migrated in excess of the limits that predict later loosening in primary THA but it remains to be seen whether these limits apply to this selected group of frail osteoporotic patients. We continue to use this technique routinely to treat patients with the same indications, but since the analysis of these data we have added screw fixation of the acetabular component to the ischial tuberosity and the superior pubic ramus.", "prediction_text": "The study reports that out of 10 osteoporotic patients with acetabular fractures who underwent immediate THA using an oversized acetabular component with cup-cage reconstruction, three components had migration above the suggested limits for primary THA at 1 year postoperatively. The contact surface achieved between the acetabular component and pelvis ranged from 11 to 17 cm\u00b2 (15-27% of each component). These findings suggest that while cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups may provide some initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures, there is still a risk of component migration within the first year."}
{"answers": "Despite high perioperative mortality, results document a sustainable recovery of the survivors offering the prospect of a highly independent and satisfying life. Therefore, advanced age alone should not be a contraindication for redo cardiac interventions. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2016; 16: 1138-1144.", "prediction_text": "In this study, the functional status and quality of life of octogenarian patients who underwent cardiac reoperations were assessed using the Barthel Index, New York Heart Association class, and short form-12 questionnaire. The survival rate was relatively low, with 32.1% in-hospital mortality and 19.0% mortality during follow-up. However, the surviving patients had good functional status and quality of life, with mean Barthel Index scores of 89 and New York Heart Association class of 2. Additionally, 93% of the patients were living at home, and their physical and mental health scores were comparable to age- and sex-matched normative population."}
{"answers": "Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (ie, SMI) were more likely than other patients to be admitted to nursing homes with higher deficiency citations for both overall quality and clinical care quality. Further research is necessary to understand the reasons behind the disparity in quality of nursing home care associated with SMI.", "prediction_text": "Yes, according to the study, patients with serious mental illness (schizophrenia or bipolar disorder) are more likely to be admitted to nursing homes with more total and healthcare-related deficiencies in care, even after controlling for various factors."}
{"answers": "Patients undergoing open access procedures are less likely to be properly informed about their endoscopic procedure. Our results indicate that with open access endoscopy, a defined mechanism needs to be in place for communication of endoscopic results to the patient.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that patients undergoing open access endoscopy receive less procedure information and explanation compared to patients referred from a gastrointestinal subspecialty clinic, potentially raising concerns about informed consent and patient satisfaction."}
{"answers": "Contrary to common belief, we found that uterine myomas commonly decrease in volume over the course of pregnancy.", "prediction_text": "Myomas, also known as uterine fibroids, can both decrease and increase in volume during pregnancy. In the first half to second quarter, about half of the myomas decreased in size with a mean decrease of 35%, while the other half enlarged with a mean increase of 69%. In the second quarter to last quarter, most myomas decreased in size with a mean decrease of 30%, but some still enlarged with a mean increase of 102%. Overall, the results suggest that myomas can exhibit variable growth patterns during pregnancy."}
{"answers": "We found that all of the studied dimensions of restricted fetal growth are independently associated with increased risks of low intellectual performance and that these associations are only partly mediated by socioeconomic or familial factors.", "prediction_text": "The study found that birth characteristics, including being light for gestational age, short, or having a small head circumference, were independently associated with an increased risk of low intellectual performance in early adulthood, even after adjusting for socioeconomic factors and within families."}
{"answers": "Although feasible, double reading of barium enemas does not improve sensitivity for detection of polyps and produces a higher false-positive rate.", "prediction_text": "Double reading of barium enemas increases the number of detected lesions and potential alterations of clinical treatment, but decreases specificity and overall agreement, with an average additional time of 3.3 minutes per examination. The sensitivity for detecting adenocarcinomas remains 100%. The decision on its necessity depends on the balance between increased detection and decreased specificity in individual clinical contexts."}
{"answers": "The VMPA can provide direct access and favorable visibility to the TMJ region and yield good esthetic and functional results. The VMPA can be considered the approach of choice for common TMJ surgeries.", "prediction_text": "Yes, based on this clinical study, the vascular-guided multilayer preauricular approach (VMPA) to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) resulted in successful surgeries with favorable incision healing and no reported cases of permanent facial nerve weakness or severe complications."}
{"answers": "The metastasis rate of station 9 lymph nodes was significantly lower than other mediastinal stations in lung cancer patients. The metastasis status of station 9 had no significant influence on tumor staging or prognosis. Routine dissection of station 9 lymph nodes may not be necessary, especially in patients with a low T stage, upper or middle lobe tumors, or without intrapulmonary lymph node metastasis.", "prediction_text": "Based on the research, the metastasis rate of station 9 lymph nodes is low (3.45%), and its metastasis is significantly correlated with other factors. The staging results of most patients would not be impaired without dissection, and its metastasis status had no significant influence on survival. Therefore, routine dissection of station 9 lymph nodes may not be necessary for primary lung cancer."}
{"answers": "During the time period considered, the FDA AED-related suicidality warning does not appear to have significantly affected prescription claims of AED medications for the study population.", "prediction_text": "The study found no significant change in antiepileptic drug prescription claims trends before, during, or after the FDA suicidality warning."}
{"answers": "In our population of stroke survivors, self-reports of motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions differed from government records. In future studies, the use of both government and self-reported data would ensure a more accurate picture of driving safety post-stroke.", "prediction_text": "The agreement between Department of Transportation records and self-reports of motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions among stroke survivors is moderate, with up to 56% more accidents and up to 46% more convictions identified when both sources are consulted."}
{"answers": "The realized communication skills courses resulted in relevant changes in communication behaviour and self-confidence of participants. Communication with terminally ill patients can be taught.", "prediction_text": "Yes, based on the findings from this study, communication skills for interacting with terminally ill patients can be effectively taught through a 2-day course, as evidenced by increased participant satisfaction and self-reported improvements in communication security and behavior."}
{"answers": "For conditions with a well-developed quality of care evidence base, such as hypertension and diabetes, a single structured implicit review to assess the quality of care over a period of time is moderately reliable. This method could be a reasonable complement or alternative to explicit indicator approaches for assessing and comparing quality of care. Structured implicit review, like explicit quality measures, must be used more cautiously for illnesses for which the evidence base is less well developed, such as COPD and acute, short-course illnesses.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that peer review can play a role in profiling quality of care, particularly for conditions with a well-developed evidence base, such as diabetes and hypertension, where the reliability of a single review is higher (ICC = 0.46) compared to conditions with a less developed evidence base (ICC = 0.16-0.26 for COPD and acute conditions). The higher reliability is due to reviewers' ability to distinguish more differences in quality of care between patients, not less random noise or individual reviewer bias."}
{"answers": "The high rate of unsuccessful IUD insertions reported here, particularly for nulliparous women, suggests that the true insertion failure rate of providers who are not employing additional tools for difficult insertions may be much higher than reported in clinical trials. Further investigation is necessary to determine if this is a common problem and, if so, to assess if the use of adjuvant measures will reduce the number of unsuccessful IUD insertions.", "prediction_text": "The study found that 19.6% of IUD insertions among nulliparous women and 13.6% among parous women for emergency contraception were unsuccessful in community family planning clinics. The adjusted odds ratio suggested a higher risk of failure in nulliparous women, although the result was not statistically significant. These findings highlight the potential issue of failed IUD insertions in community practice."}
{"answers": "Even in capped health care systems, virtual planning and guided surgery including prebent or milled plates are financially viable.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, the use of virtual planning and guided surgery in head and neck reconstruction with fibular free flaps resulted in significant time savings during surgery, reducing the additional cost from US $5,098 to US $1,231.50 for prebent plates and from US $6,980 to US $3,113.50 for milled plates, making it economically viable."}
{"answers": "Bipolarity does not independently influence risk of suicidal behavior or alter the influence of well-established suicide risk factors within affective disorders. Suicide risk assessment strategies may continue to appraise these common risk factors without regard to mood polarity.", "prediction_text": "The research paper did not find any evidence that risk factors for suicidal behavior differ by affective disorder polarity, after controlling for other factors such as age, hopelessness, and active substance abuse."}
{"answers": "The administration of polyvalent Crotalidae antivenin is safe. Acute hypersensitivity, when it occurs, consists solely in most cases of urticaria. Serious side effects are uncommon.", "prediction_text": "The study identified acute side effects from polyvalent antivenin in 18% of rattlesnake bite victims, all of which were urticaria. No deaths, amputations, or permanent disabilities occurred."}
{"answers": "Although endomyocardial fibrosis patients have improved clinical symptoms after surgery, the global left ventricular ejection fraction and regional wall motion in these patients do not change. This finding suggests that other explanations, such as improvements in diastolic function, may be operational.", "prediction_text": "The study found no significant change in quantitative left ventricular regional wall motion after fibrous tissue resection in endomyocardial fibrosis patients. However, there was an improvement in New York Heart Association functional class in 83% of patients postoperatively."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrates that laser pretreatment significantly increases absorption of topical lidocaine so that it is detectable in the blood and that manipulating laser settings can affect drug absorption. Future work will look at translating this effect into clinical benefit.", "prediction_text": "Yes, this study demonstrates that in vivo transdermal absorption of topical lidocaine is enhanced by fractional laser treatment, as evidenced by detectable serum levels and significantly higher peak levels following laser treatment at 250 \u00b5m ablative depth compared to other laser settings."}
{"answers": "Vaccines were exposed to temperatures that may reduce their potency. Safe storage of vaccines in the clinics cannot be ensured without adhering to the recommended guidelines. Provision of adequate equipment and training for staff in maintaining the \"cold chain\" and the use and care of equipment are important components of a successful immunisation programme.", "prediction_text": "Based on the research, a significant number of community healthcare settings were found to have inadequate vaccine storage conditions, with only 40% of respondents aware of the appropriate storage conditions and fewer monitoring temperatures daily. Eight of the monitored practices had vaccines exposed to subzero temperatures or temperatures up to 16 degrees C, highlighting potential weaknesses in the community cold chain."}
{"answers": "p53 alteration detected by IHC or SSCP analysis is not a clinically useful predictor of local response to pre-operative adjuvant therapy in advanced rectal carcinoma.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find a significant correlation between p53 alterations (either protein accumulation or gene mutation) and tumour response to pre-operative chemo-radiotherapy in terms of reduction in tumour size or local failure in locally advanced rectal cancer. (The study found a slightly greater average reduction in tumour size in the group with altered p53, but this difference was not statistically significant.)"}
{"answers": "The results of this study cast doubt on the suggested advantage of HBO in reducing patient mortality and morbidity when used as adjuvant therapy for NF.", "prediction_text": "The study found a lower mortality rate in the non-HBO group (25%) compared to the HBO group (36%), and more surgical d\u00e9bridements were required in the HBO group. However, the average length of hospitalization for survivors was shorter in the HBO group. The overall evidence suggests that the role of HBO in the treatment of necrotizing fasciitis remains controversial."}
{"answers": "High doses of ZNS are effective and safe in pharmacoresistant epileptic patients. Therapeutic drug monitoring of ZNS may be considered at therapeutic failure.", "prediction_text": "The study reports that out of nine European adult pharmacoresistant epilepsy patients treated with high doses of zonisamide (>500 mg/d), five achieved seizure reduction of more than 50%, and five continued treatment for over a year. Adverse events were observed in 33% of patients, and good tolerance to high doses of other antiepileptic drugs was observed in 66% of patients. Plasma levels of zonisamide were within therapeutic range in the two patients tested. These findings suggest that higher doses of zonisamide may be effective and tolerable for some European adult pharmacoresistant epilepsy patients."}
{"answers": "In conclusion, high Ki-67 expression was associated with poor survival in patients with UTUC, as well as a high risk of disease progression, although these findings need to be interpreted with caution. Large-scale, adequately designed, prospective trials are needed to further confirm the value of Ki-67 in prognosis of UTUC patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, overexpression of Ki-67 is a significant independent prognostic biomarker of poor cancer-specific survival and disease-free survival in Upper Tract Urinary Carcinoma patients, as indicated by both IHC results and a meta-analysis of published literature."}
{"answers": "After comparing MR with arthroscopic findings and reviewing the available literature, we conclude that arthroscopy permits the direct visualization of even fine articular surface changes but does not depict the subchondral bone, the most frequent site of injury detected with MRI. MRI was a very useful tool in the detection and characterization of the different types of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries and showed a statistically significant correlation between site and distribution of bone and cartilage injuries and between internal damage and trauma mechanisms. Therefore, we believe that MRI can help avoid diagnostic arthroscopy in the patients with a history of post-traumatic pain, acute articular blocks and negative radiographic findings.", "prediction_text": "MRI identified more bone bruises and subchondral injuries than arthroscopy, while both methods detected similar numbers of osteochondral injuries. Therefore, MRI can complement conventional radiography in the detection of occult post-traumatic injuries of the knee, but may not completely substitute for diagnostic arthroscopy."}
{"answers": "The prevalence of cognitive impairment in MND in this population based study of an unselected cohort was higher than has been previously reported. Language deficits, especially anomia, may be relatively frequent in the MND population. Aphasia in MND may be masked by dysarthria and missed if not specifically examined.", "prediction_text": "The study identified cognitive dysfunction and language deficits in 28% of patients with motor neuron disease, with three patients exhibiting dementia and impaired language function, and two patients displaying aphasic syndrome. These findings suggest an underrecognized association between dementia and aphasia in motor neuron disease."}
{"answers": "Postoperative numbness occurs in most patients receiving nasal microfat injections. Partial to complete recovery of nasal tip sensation can be expected to occur over a 3-month period.", "prediction_text": "Yes, sensation in the nasal tip gradually returns after microfat grafting, with significant improvement observed up to 12 weeks post-procedure. (Based on the given study, the sensation recovery was from 3.35 units at week 12 to the preoperative value of 3.60 units.)"}
{"answers": "Conveyance of emotions or movements through music may be decoded differently by persons with different types of communication disorders. Because music is the primary therapeutic tool in music therapy sessions, clinicians should consider these differential abilities when selecting music for clinical interventions focusing on emotions or movement.", "prediction_text": "Yes, communication disorders, such as those found in children with severe to profound hearing loss using cochlear implants and autism spectrum disorder, can impact the ability to recognize symbolic representation of emotions and movements in music, potentially affecting the effectiveness of music therapy interventions. The study found that children with cochlear implants were less accurate than typically developing children in identifying both musical emotions and movements. However, there was no significant difference between children with autism spectrum disorder and typically developing children in this regard."}
{"answers": "For some patients, using colour to describe their pain experience may be a useful tool to improve doctor-patient communication.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that patients with knee osteoarthritis can use color to describe their pain, with red commonly chosen for high-intensity pain due to its association with inflammation and other negative feelings, and calmer colors used for the absence of pain due to positive emotional associations. However, interpretability and standardization of color use remain concerns."}
{"answers": "It appears safe to administer intensive chemotherapy regimens at standard doses to rural patients without increased morbidity or mortality. Support for general practitioners through phone or videoconferencing may reduce the safety concerns.", "prediction_text": "The retrospective audit found no significant difference in serious adverse events or dose intensities between urban and rural patients receiving intensive chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal and node-positive breast cancers at Townsville Cancer Centre. The rates of febrile neutropenia, diarrhea, and vomiting were similar, and no toxic deaths occurred in either group."}
{"answers": "Although outcomes for EPSCC remains poor, both surgery and radiation is shown to significantly improve median, 5- and 10-year survival rates. EPSCC patients who are potential candidates for surgical resection or radiation therapy may benefit from these treatments.", "prediction_text": "Yes, based on the SEER database analysis, both surgery and radiation therapy have a positive impact on the survival of patients with extrapulmonary small cell carcinomas, particularly for those with gastrointestinal disease. Independent predictors of better survival include being younger than 50, female gender, earlier cancer stage, and receiving radiation and surgery."}
{"answers": "DGE after PPPD seems to be of minor clinical importance following uncomplicated surgery. When taking the results into consideration, it can be said that, despite the lack of a control group, antecolic duodenojejunostomy might be the key to a low incidence of DGE after PPPD. In our experience, DGE is linked to the occurrence of other postoperative complications rather than to pylorus preservation.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the incidence of delayed gastric emptying following pancreaticoduodenectomy is lower in patients with antecolic duodenojejunostomy, which is a modification of the original pylorus-preserving procedure. The overall incidence of DGE was 12%, but was only seen in 3% of patients with no postoperative complications other than DGE. In contrast, 30% of patients with complications other than DGE experienced delayed gastric emptying. However, this study was not randomized, so further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "In women with POP, the symptom of pelvic pain is associated with the presence of defecatory symptoms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, pelvic pain is associated with an increased prevalence of defecatory symptoms, including straining, sense of incomplete emptying, pain with bowel movement, and splinting, in women with pelvic organ prolapse. (ORs: 2.4-5.3, 95% CIs: 1.3-23.0)"}
{"answers": "The results confirm that c-kit is vastly expressed in uveal melanoma, suggest that the c-kit molecular pathway may be important in uveal melanoma growth, and point to its use as a target for therapy with STI571.", "prediction_text": "The study provides evidence for the expression and tyrosine phosphorylation of c-kit in uveal melanoma, with autocrine stimulation of uveal melanoma cell lines. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 effectively blocks c-kit phosphorylation and induces cell death in uveal melanoma cell lines, suggesting c-Kit as a potential therapeutic target for uveal melanoma. (IC50 for inhibition of c-kit phosphorylation and cell proliferation is less than 2.5 microM.)"}
{"answers": "Results suggest that telmisartan may reduce type-I diabetes mellitus-induced hepatic injury by suppressing activated hepatic stellate cells through concomitant TGF-beta1 down-regulation.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that telmisartan may prevent hepatic fibrosis in rats with alloxan-induced diabetes as indicated by a lack of TGF-beta immunoreactivity in the liver of the treated group. However, the study does not directly measure fibrosis, but rather the presence of TGF-beta, a key marker of fibrosis. Further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "The great majority of U.S. renal transplant centers will not transplant kidneys to HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease, even if their infection is asymptomatic. However, advances in the management of HIV infection and a review of relevant ethical issues suggest that this approach should be reconsidered.", "prediction_text": "Based on the surveyed U.S. transplant centers, the majority still exclude asymptomatic HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease from transplantation due to concerns about harm to the individual and wasting precious organs."}
{"answers": "The overall yield of SL for HCC was 7 %, and the accuracy was 27 %. When accurate imaging methods are available and additional percutaneous liver biopsy is implemented as a standard procedure in the preoperative workup of patients with HCC, the benefit of SL will become even less.", "prediction_text": "The study found that staging laparoscopy for hepatocellular carcinoma had a yield of 7% (3-17%) and an accuracy of 27% (11-52%). It led to changes in management for 17% of patients with cirrhosis based on biopsy results. However, SL was unsuccessful in 14.3% of cases due to unresectable tumors or severe cirrhosis."}
{"answers": "Expert breast pathology assessments continue to be necessary in the management of DCIS.", "prediction_text": "Yes, expert breast pathology assessment is necessary for the management of ductal carcinoma in situ as it leads to significant changes in local recurrence risk assessment and treatment in approximately 29% and 43% of cases, respectively."}
{"answers": "Vaginal pH should be measured by bringing the pH strip in direct contact with fresh vaginal fluid without first adding saline.", "prediction_text": "No, vaginal pH cannot be accurately measured from a wet mount slide after the addition of saline due to systematic increases in pH leading to false positive readings."}
{"answers": "This study presents a different clinical picture of oral mucoceles/ranulas, as observed in HIV-positive patients. Additionally, it suggests a possible clinical link between the two pathologies. The authors strongly support the suggestion that oral mucocele/ranula is an HIV-related salivary gland disease.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that HIV-positive patients have a statistically significant higher risk (P<0.001) of developing both simple and plunging ranulas compared to HIV-negative patients."}
{"answers": "There are no data to support the widespread practice of using central venous pressure to guide fluid therapy. This approach to fluid resuscitation should be abandoned.", "prediction_text": "The meta-analysis of 43 studies found that the central venous pressure had a summary AUC of 0.56 (95% CI, 0.54-0.58) for predicting fluid responsiveness, with no heterogeneity between studies. The correlation coefficient between central venous pressure and change in stroke volume index/cardiac index was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.1-0.25), with higher values in ICU patients (0.28; 95% CI, 0.16-0.40) and lower values in operating room patients (0.11; 95% C"}
{"answers": "Increased D-dimer levels should not be considered as a diagnostic parameter in diagnosis of acute appendicitis.", "prediction_text": "Based on the research paper provided, there was no statistically significant difference in D-dimer levels between the histopathologic study groups of acute appendicitis patients (P>.05), therefore, D-dimer cannot be concluded as a new diagnostic parameter for acute appendicitis based on this study."}
{"answers": "Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mitochondria play a role in the remodeling process of lace plant leaves during programmed cell death, as evidenced by changes in mitochondrial dynamics and the correlation between mitochondrial stages and the progression of cell death. The mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) may be involved in this process."}
{"answers": "Our study emphasised the discomfort of transurethral urinary catheters, especially in male patients, and the high incidence of urinary tract infections in both sexes. Consideration should be given to the utilisation of alternative methods of bladder drainage, such as suprapubic catheterisation, which can be performed with ease during laparotomy.", "prediction_text": "The study found that male patients had lower satisfaction with transurethral catheterisation and reported more pain during and after the procedure. Additionally, half of the patients experienced symptoms of urinary tract infection after catheter removal. These findings suggest that transurethral catheterisation may not be the ideal method of bladder drainage."}
{"answers": "Based on this pilot data, MASCC score appears promising in determining suitability for outpatient management of NF in gynecologic oncology patients. Prospective study is ongoing to confirm safety and determine impact on cost.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the MASCC risk index is useful for risk stratification of gynecologic oncology patients with neutropenic fever. Low-risk patients had lower rates of severe complications, ICU admission, overall mortality, and death due to neutropenic fever compared to high-risk patients."}
{"answers": "Halofantrine has mild to moderate pathological effects on cochlea histology, and can be considered an ototoxic drug.", "prediction_text": "Yes, halofantrine is ototoxic as shown by inner and outer hair cell distortion and loss of spiral ganglia cells in guinea pigs at therapeutic and double therapeutic doses."}
{"answers": "Proportionally fewer elderly patients with OPSCC are being treated than younger individuals. These patients can have significant benefits from aggressive treatments despite their older age as shown by our survival analysis. We recommend the use of objective measures to assess patient fitness to reduce the potential for undertreatment in the elderly population.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found an increase in the number of elderly patients (age 55 and above) with oropharyngeal carcinoma who did not receive treatment. However, the analysis also showed that surgery, radiation, or combined therapy benefited patients in the age groups 65 to 74 and 75 to 84, with no statistically significant difference in the hazard ratios for combined treatment among these age groups."}
{"answers": "Minimal access surgery for the repair of esophageal atresia or congenital diaphragmatic hernia is not associated with less cumulative opioid doses.", "prediction_text": "According to this study, there was no significant difference in opioid consumption or pain scores between neonates undergoing minimal access surgery and conventional surgery for esophageal atresia and congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that minimal access surgery hurts less in newborns based on this research."}
{"answers": "Clinical predictors appear inadequate for the evaluation of the cervical spine in geriatric trauma patients with low-energy mechanism.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that clinical predictors are not adequate in identifying cervical spine fractures in geriatric blunt trauma patients with low-energy mechanism, as only neck tenderness showed a significant association with injury in this population."}
{"answers": "European individuals with type 1 diabetes consume a high atherogenic diet as few patients met recommendations for dietary fibre and saturated fat. This study showed minor changes in dietary nutrients and energy intakes over a period of 7 years. Nutrition education needs particular focus on strategies to increase dietary fibre and reduce saturated fat to exploit their potential benefit.", "prediction_text": "European individuals with type 1 diabetes show poor adherence to current nutritional recommendations for fiber and saturated fat, suggesting a potential persistence of a high atherogenic diet despite minor changes in nutrient intake over 7 years."}
{"answers": "The gaps in patella eversion demonstrated smaller gaps both in knee extension and flexion position compared to the gaps of patella reduction position. The amount of decreased gaps was more definite in knee flexion position. Therefore, the intraoperative patellar positioning has influence on the measurement of the joint gap. Keeping the patella in reduced position is important during gap balancing.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patella position significantly influences ligament balancing in total knee arthroplasty, with patella eversion resulting in smaller gaps in both extension and flexion positions compared to patella reduction. However, there is notable variability in knee flexion position and a significant portion of subluxated and everted patellae demonstrate increased or decreased gaps compared to reduction position."}
{"answers": "We have thus provided compelling evidence that there is a mossy fiber GABAergic signal. The physiologic role of this mossy fiber GABAergic signal is uncertain, but may be of developmental importance. Other evidence suggests that this GABAergic signal is transiently upregulated after seizures. This could have an inhibitory or disinhibitory effect, and further work is needed to elucidate its actual role.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mossy fibers release GABA and form inhibitory synapses on CA3 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus, as demonstrated by whole-cell voltage clamp recordings in hippocampal slices from guinea pigs."}
{"answers": "Men and women in this community sample reported similar patterns of depressive symptoms. No evidence that the presentation of depressive symptoms differs by gender was found.", "prediction_text": "The study found no evidence that gender differences in self-reported depression symptoms account for the higher rates of depression in women."}
{"answers": "Time to primary treatment after a diagnosis of breast cancer had no impact on overall survival. Further studies on care before diagnosis are important in drawing up meaningful quality indicators.", "prediction_text": "According to this study, there was no significant impact of delays in time to primary treatment on overall survival in breast cancer patients. However, ethnicity and stage at presentation were associated with delayed treatment."}
{"answers": "Our findings reveal a significant decrease in ADMA levels of ex-ELBW subjects compared to C, underlining a probable correlation with preterm birth and low birth weight. Taken together, these results may underlie the onset of early circulatory dysfunction predictive of increased cardiovascular risk.", "prediction_text": "Yes, this study found that young adults born preterm at extremely low birth weight had lower ADMA levels compared to a control group, and these levels inversely correlated with gestational age and birth weight, suggesting that lower ADMA levels in preterm individuals may predict early endothelial dysfunction."}
{"answers": "ECL assays improved the ability to predict time to diabetes in these autoantibody-positive relatives at risk for developing diabetes. These findings might be helpful in the design and eligibility criteria for prevention trials in the future.", "prediction_text": "Yes, electrochemiluminescence assays improve prediction of time to type 1 diabetes in autoantibody-positive TrialNet subjects. ECL positivity was significantly associated with a higher risk of progression to diabetes, and adding ECL to the Diabetes Prevention Trial risk score increased the predictive accuracy."}
{"answers": "These findings indicate that a relationship between multiple sclerosis and streptococcal infections may exist, but to acquire a better understanding of the role of group A streptococci in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, more studies with animal models are necessary.", "prediction_text": "The study found that patients with Multiple Sclerosis had significantly higher levels of antideoxyribonuclease B (ADNase B) compared to healthy controls, suggesting a potential association between past streptococcal infections and MS. However, no difference was observed in antistreptolysin O (ASO) levels between the two groups."}
{"answers": "Aplastic anemia is associated with a variety of autoimmune syndromes. The sequence of events in our patient suggests that the hepatic failure, AFOP, and the VSAA may all have been part of an autoimmune syndrome. AFOP could be the result of immune dysregulation in this pediatric case with favorable outcome after immunosuppressive therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, this case report suggests that acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP) may be associated with immune dysregulation, as the first nonfatal case occurred in a child with very severe aplastic anemia, and the condition improved only after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation."}
{"answers": "Rescue AC may apply to only 18% of cases, and we identified subsets of more likely candidates.", "prediction_text": "Among women receiving antenatal corticosteroids between 24-32 weeks' gestation, only 17.9% remained pregnant and delivered at less than 34 weeks. Those at higher risk for delivering prematurely after AC included women with premature preterm rupture of membranes, twins, or those treated before 28 weeks."}
{"answers": "The results show that fatigue in patients with pSS and sSS is not due to the coexistence of FM in most cases. A lower incidence in the United Kingdom of FM in patients with pSS was found than has been previously reported.", "prediction_text": "The study found a higher prevalence of fatigue in primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome patients (68%) compared to lupus patients (50%), and a higher prevalence of fibromyalgia in primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome patients (12%) compared to lupus patients (5%). However, none of the patients with secondary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome had fibromyalgia. These findings suggest an association between fatigue and primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, but not between fibromyalgia and primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome."}
{"answers": "UDR provides an objective measurement of VUR and appears as a predictive tool of success after endoscopic injection.", "prediction_text": "Yes, both distal ureteral diameter and ureteral diameter ratio were significant predictors of reflux resolution after endoscopic injection in children with primary vesicoureteral reflux. (Source: The given medical research paper)"}
{"answers": ": Data from both association and expression studies suggested that variants at HINT1 may be associated with schizophrenia and the associations may be sex-specific. However, the markers showing associations were in high LD to the SPEC2/PDZ-GEF2/ACSL6 locus reported previously in the same samples. This made it difficult to separate the association signals amongst these genes. Other independent studies may be necessary to distinguish these candidate genes.", "prediction_text": "The study found nominally significant differences in SNP allele frequencies around the HINT1 gene in schizophrenia samples compared to controls in sex-stratified analyses. However, no significant difference in HINT1 expression was observed between patients and controls. Interactions between sex, diagnosis, and rs3864283 genotypes were significant. These findings suggest that the HINT1 gene may play a role in the development of schizophrenia, but further research is needed to confirm this association."}
{"answers": "Out of the four sacral sparing criteria, the acute phase anal sensory score measurements do not contribute significantly to the prognosis of independent ambulation. The combination of the acute phase voluntary anal contraction and the S4-5 LT and PP scores, predicts significantly better chronic phase-independent ambulation outcomes than the currently used distinction between complete and incomplete SCI.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that determination of sacral sparing measurements, specifically S4-5 light touch and pin prick scores, in the acute phase of traumatic spinal cord injury provides better predictive values for independent ambulation at one year post-injury compared to the current distinction between complete and incomplete injuries."}
{"answers": "These findings suggest that schizophrenia is associated with progressive structural brain abnormalities, affecting both gray and white matter. We found no evidence to suggest progressive medial temporal lobe involvement but did find evidence that this may be partly explained by heterogeneity between studies in patient age and illness duration. The causes and clinical correlates of these progressive brain changes should now be the focus of investigation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the research indicates that individuals with schizophrenia experience significant progressive decreases in whole brain volume, gray matter, frontal gray and white matter, parietal white matter, and temporal white matter, as well as increases in lateral ventricular volume over time compared to healthy control subjects."}
{"answers": "The elevated risk of death after CABG surgery known previously to be associated with CDM seems also to be shared by a group of similar size that includes patients with IFG and undiagnosed DM.", "prediction_text": "Yes, impaired fasting blood glucose levels (5.6-6.1 mmol/L) were associated with a relative risk of 1.9 (CI: 0.8-6.3) for 1-year mortality after CABG surgery."}
{"answers": "This is the first known report of concurrent plasma and ISF concentrations of a meropenem antibiotic during CVVHDF. We observed that the ISF concentrations of meropenem were significantly lower than the plasma concentrations, although the present dose was appropriate for infections caused by intermediately susceptible pathogens (MIC\u22644 mg/L).", "prediction_text": "No, interstitial fluid meropenem concentrations are lower than plasma concentrations in critically ill patients undergoing continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration, with an estimated penetration of approximately 60-74%."}
{"answers": "Despite advances in early diagnosis and surgical technique, 5-year survival of stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma remains low as compared to survival of other solid organ neoplasm. Tumour size<or=3cm, adenocarcinoma histologic type and negative bronchial resection margins were associated with a more favourable outcome in our patient population. More effective multimodality treatments are needed to increase survival rates.", "prediction_text": "The study found that in Stage I non-small cell lung cancer patients undergoing curative resection and complete lymphadenectomy, histology (adenocarcinoma having better prognosis than squamous cell carcinoma) and tumor size (smaller tumors having better survival) were significant prognostic factors, along with the presence of a negative resection margin. Five-year survival rates were 67% for tumors less than or equal to 3cm and 46% for tumors over 3cm. The difference in survival between T1N0 and T2N0 disease was not statistically significant (66% vs 55%). These findings suggest that"}
{"answers": "There is a knowledge deficit regarding the SU treatment goal among gout patients receiving ULT, despite generally high levels of other gout-specific knowledge. SU goal information may be an important and underutilized concept among providers treating gout patients.", "prediction_text": "Only 14% of gout patients in this study were aware of their serum urate goal, and having a rheumatologist as the initial prescriber and knowing all other gout-specific knowledge questions were associated with greater odds of knowing the goal. SU goal knowledge was linked to better self-reported global health status."}
{"answers": "Despite government assistance, low-income individuals use vision care services less often than wealthy individuals.", "prediction_text": "The study found that among middle-aged white individuals without major vision problems, those with financial difficulty had lower utilization of eye care providers (prevalence ratio 0.68, 95% CI 0.57-0.80), suggesting that government assistance may not fully address the financial barriers for low-income individuals to access eye care services."}
{"answers": "Premature births from rural mothers have a higher risk of stillbirth and mortality in neonatal intensive care than urban infants.", "prediction_text": "Yes, infants born to mothers residing in rural areas have poorer neonatal outcomes, including higher mortality and stillbirth rates, compared to those born to urban residents in the studied population."}
{"answers": "Altered ET-1 levels may be involved in the pathogenesis of rebound hypertension and hypotension during HD.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that endothelin-1 levels decrease during HD-induced hypotension and increase during rebound hypertension, indicating a potential role in the hemodynamic changes during hemodialysis."}
{"answers": "While FS was commonly used in patients undergoing thyroidectomy at our institution, in no patient over the last decade did FS correctly alter the intraoperative management. Given the time required to perform FS and the cost associated with it, we believe that routine FS should not be performed in these patients.", "prediction_text": "In this study, frozen section analysis did not alter the intraoperative management of multinodular thyroid disease, and its sensitivity for the diagnosis of thyroid cancer was only 25%."}
{"answers": "Elderly patients have informational and relational needs similar to those of younger patients. In fact, most of the whole sample flagged up the need for higher levels of satisfaction especially concerning a better dialogue with health staff, along with a new factor: the need to talk to people with the same illness.", "prediction_text": "Yes, according to this study, elderly cancer patients expressed more frequent needs for financial-insurance information, the need to talk to people with the same illness, more comprehensible information from doctors and nurses, and a better dialogue with clinicians compared to younger patients. Few significant differences were found in other care needs."}
{"answers": "According to the results of our study and the data from the international literature, the entity globulomaxillary cyst is no longer justified.", "prediction_text": "The term \"globulomaxillary cyst\" is no longer considered a valid entity in medical literature. The cystic lesions previously diagnosed as globulomaxillary cysts can be classified as various other entities such as lateral periodontal cysts, radicular cysts, keratocystic odontogenic tumors, adenomatoid odontogenic tumors, periapical granulomas, residual cysts, or undefined jaw cysts based on clinical, radiological, and histological findings."}
{"answers": "Although components of the CSM (cognitive and emotional representations, coping strategies) were associated with fears of recurrence, optimism was found to be the strongest predictor of fear, independent of anxiety and level of fear reported prior to treatment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, pre-treatment fears of recurrence and optimism are predictive of long-term fears of recurrence in head and neck cancer survivors."}
{"answers": "Older adults enrolled in PICT with more symptoms may sacrifice QOL for experimental treatment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the presence of multiple symptoms in older adults with advanced cancer is associated with increased admissions, complications, and functional decline during phase I clinical trials."}
{"answers": "Effective CPAP treatment in IPF patients with OSA results in a significant improvement in daily living activities based on the FOSQ, namely an OSA-specific follow-up instrument. Improvement was also noted in other questionnaires assessing quality of life, though not to a statistically significant degree, probably because of the multifactorial influences of IPF on physical and mental health. The probability of poor CPAP compliance was high and could only be eliminated with intense follow-up by the CPAP clinic staff.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that CPAP therapy improves functional outcomes in sleep quality in IPF patients with obstructive sleep apnea, as indicated by a significant increase in the Functional Outcomes in Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ) scores at 1, 3, and 6 months after initiation of CPAP therapy. However, the study also reports that two patients had difficulty complying with CPAP due to nocturnal cough and claustrophobia, and both stopped using CPAP despite intensive follow-up. Heated humidification was added for all patients to address the common complaint of disabling nocturnal cough. Overall, the study provides evidence for the potential benefits of CPAP therapy"}
{"answers": "Income support policy may be a significant new lever for improving population health, especially that of lower-income persons. Even though the findings are robust, further analyses are needed to confirm their reliability. Future research should examine a variety of different income support policies, as well as whether a broader range of social and economic policies affect health.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the Supplemental Security Income program is associated with a reduction in disability among elderly individuals, as shown by a decrease in mobility limitations with an increase in maximum benefits."}
{"answers": "None of the clinical identifiers for early-stage adhesive capsulitis previously proposed by expert consensus have been validated in this study. Clinicians should be aware that commonly used clinical identifiers may not be applicable to this stage.", "prediction_text": "The study identified pain at the end of range of all measured active movements as the only significant clinical identifier for early-stage primary/idiopathic adhesive capsulitis based on a positive anesthetic response. However, the lack of a standardized diagnostic reference for early-stage adhesive capsulitis limits the accuracy and generalizability of these findings."}
{"answers": "Despite current recommendations, cough and cold medicines are still used in children younger than 6 years of age. A significant portion of caregivers report that they are still unaware of public warnings, potential side effects, and interactions with other medications.", "prediction_text": "Yes, based on this study, concerns regarding incorrect dosing of cough and cold medicines in young children persist after FDA warnings."}
{"answers": "Vitamin C reduces the prevalence of complex regional pain syndrome after wrist fractures. A daily dose of 500 mg for fifty days is recommended.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that vitamin C may have a protective effect against complex regional pain syndrome in patients with wrist fractures, as the prevalence was significantly lower in the vitamin C group (2.4%) compared to the placebo group (10.1%). The protective effect seemed to be dose-dependent, with the lowest prevalence in the 500-mg and 1500-mg groups. However, early cast-related complaints were also found to be a significant predictor of complex regional pain syndrome."}
{"answers": "The tendency to clear one's plate when eating is associated with increased body weight and may constitute a risk factor for weight gain.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that a tendency to clear one's plate when eating is positively associated with a higher body mass index (BMI) and is an independent risk factor for obesity."}
{"answers": "ACS is common in patients with SCD who present with fever and was grossly underestimated by evaluating physicians. History and physical examination appear to be of little value in defining which febrile patients require CXR. In view of the mortality and morbidity associated with ACS, empiric CXR should be considered when evaluating a febrile patient with SCD.", "prediction_text": "The study found that clinician assessment for acute chest syndrome in febrile patients with sickle cell disease has limited accuracy, as only 39% of cases were correctly identified before chest radiography."}
{"answers": "We conclude that the quality of rectal cancer excision, as defined by mesorectal grades, achieved by supervised colorectal trainees is comparable with that achieved by consultants.", "prediction_text": "According to this study, there was no statistically significant difference in the quality of TME (total mesorectal excision) surgery between consultants and supervised colorectal trainees, as assessed by mesorectal grades. Additionally, there was no significant difference in local or overall recurrence rates between the two groups."}
{"answers": "Dutch primary schools could play a more important role in fostering healthy eating habits among children. The school food policy could be improved by clearly formulating food rules, simplifying supervision of the food rules, and defining how to enforce the food rules. In addition, the school food policy will only influence children's dietary behaviour if both the school and the parents support the policy.", "prediction_text": "The study reveals that while most Dutch primary schools have a written food policy, its clarity and enforcement vary. Principals and teachers believe that parents have a primary role in promoting healthy eating habits, but parents expect schools to contribute as well. Parental opinions on the enforcement of the school food policy are divided, with some calling for stronger enforcement. These findings suggest that there is room for improvement in the clarity, implementation, and enforcement of school food policies at Dutch primary schools."}
{"answers": "Speed discrimination, per se, is not impaired in schizophrenia patients. The observed abnormality appears to be a consequence of impairment in generating or integrating the feedback information from eye movements. This study introduces a novel approach to motion perception studies and highlights the importance of concurrently measuring eye movements to understand interactions between these two systems; the results argue for a conceptual revision regarding motion perception abnormality in schizophrenia.", "prediction_text": "The findings suggest that eye-tracking abnormality in schizophrenia may interact with motion perception deficits, as eye movements were correlated with speed discrimination in control subjects but not in patients. However, the study does not definitively prove that eye-tracking abnormalities cause motion perception deficits in schizophrenia. Further research is needed to establish a causal relationship."}
{"answers": "(1) There is little overlap between regions of CFAEs during AF and regions of SRF measured in the time domain or the frequency domain, (2) the majority of SRF appears to occur in regions with wave-front collision, (3) the distribution of SRF is similar in patients with AF and normal controls, suggesting that this may not have an important role in AF maintenance and may not be a suitable ablation target.", "prediction_text": "There is no significant correlation between complex fractionated atrial electrograms recorded during atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm fractionation."}
{"answers": "Continence function remained undisturbed after anastomotic leakage due to rectal resection", "prediction_text": "The study found no significant difference in continence function or sphincter function between patients with and without anastomotic leakage after curative sphincter-preserving rectal cancer surgery. However, patients with leakage had slightly worse maximum tolerable volume and rectal compliance."}
{"answers": "No evidence was found for OPLL to have any effect on the initial neurologic status or recovery in motor function after traumatic cervical cord injury, suggesting that the neurologic outcome is not significantly dependent on canal space.", "prediction_text": "The study found no significant difference in neurologic outcomes between patients with and without ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) at the site of acute cervical spinal cord injury (SCI). Despite smaller static and dynamic canal diameters at C3 and C4 in the OPLL group, there was no correlation between OPLL and neurologic outcome as measured by the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment scale. The mean improvement rates in ASIA motor score were similar in both groups."}
{"answers": "Circumferences and related ratios scale significantly to height, notably after adjustment for age and race, across subjects who are representative of the US population. These observations have implications for the clinical and epidemiologic use of these anthropometric measures and indexes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, waist and hip circumferences scale negatively to height, with powers of 0.45-0.80, after adjusting for age and race."}
{"answers": "We found evidence that pain can be a significant clinical problem in psychiatric patients which seems to be underestimated in psychiatry. The investigated patients in general adult psychiatry are characterized by specific risk factors different from clinical subpopulations of other disciplines.", "prediction_text": "Yes, pain is a significant problem in general adult psychiatry with a high prevalence (50% point prevalence, 75.5% 6-month prevalence, and 76.5% 12-month prevalence). Depression and the number of past hospitalizations were identified as statistically significant risk factors. Impairment and unfitness for work were related to specific psychiatric diagnoses."}
{"answers": "This study found that influences on coping were multifactorial and moderated by age. These factors have implications for interventions designed to enhance coping strategies.", "prediction_text": "The research paper does not provide evidence that age moderates the effect of personality disorder on coping style in psychiatric inpatients as it did not find a significant interaction between age and personality disorder in predicting coping strategies."}
{"answers": "The study data suggests a possible correlation between cervical discopathy and cervical MS plaque.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant association between the presence of cervical cord plaques and discopathy at the same site in Multiple Sclerosis patients (P<0.05)."}
{"answers": "Higher MCVs and AST/ALT ratios in ASH reflect the severity of underlying liver disease and do not differentiate NASH from ASH. Instead, these biomarkers might prove useful in guiding selection of patients for liver biopsy and in targeting therapy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, based on this study, routine laboratory markers such as mean corpuscular volume (MCV), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio, and sex can be useful in differentiating nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) from alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH). The MCV was elevated in ASH patients and normal in NASH patients, while an AST/ALT ratio >1 and high-grade fibrosis were more common in ASH. Multivariate analysis identified these markers as relevant regressors, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve"}
{"answers": "We found no evidence that IBR compromised the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy, although there was a significant incidence of implant infection.", "prediction_text": "The study found no significant difference in the median time to chemotherapy between patients who underwent immediate breast reconstruction and those who had mastectomy alone. However, there were more complications, specifically tissue expander removals in the IBR group and more seromas in the mastectomy group. Overall complication rates were comparable between the two groups."}
{"answers": "Economic inequalities in breast and cervical cancer screening are low in LMICs with high screening coverage. These findings are consistent with the inverse equity hypothesis and indicate that high levels of equity in cancer screening are feasible even in countries with high income inequality.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the inverse equity hypothesis may not hold true for cancer screening in middle-income countries as economic inequalities in screening participation were lower or non-existent in countries with higher aggregate coverage for both breast and cervical cancer screening."}
{"answers": "Post tonsillectomy antibiotics did not prove to have a role in minimizing postoperative morbidity. Moreover, analgesics given on the basis of as required had a limited value.", "prediction_text": "The study found no evidence that the use of antibiotics after tonsillectomy reduces postoperative morbidity, including pain control, fever, secondary hemorrhage, or hospital stay."}
{"answers": "The study findings suggest that adopting measurement-based care, such as using the PHQ-9, is achievable, even in practices with limited resources.", "prediction_text": "The study found that systematic use of patient-rated depression severity monitoring with the PHQ-9 questionnaire is helpful and feasible in clinical psychiatry. It influenced clinical decision making in 93% of patient contacts, leading to treatment changes in 40% of these contacts. Common treatment changes included adjusting antidepressant dosages, adding medications, starting or increasing psychotherapy, and switching or initiating antidepressants. In 3% of patient contacts, the PHQ-9 score led to additional suicide risk assessments."}
{"answers": "There is no advantage to an intramedullary nail versus a sliding compression hip screw for low-energy pertrochanteric fractures AO/OTA 31-A1 and A2, specifically with its increased cost and lack of evidence to show decreased complications or improved patient outcome.", "prediction_text": "Based on the research paper, there was no statistically significant difference between the use of a sliding compression hip screw and an intramedullary nail in the treatment of pertrochanteric fractures, in terms of operative times, complications, radiologic outcomes, or clinical outcomes. Therefore, there is no clear advantage to using an intramedullary nail over a sliding compression hip screw for this type of fracture."}
{"answers": "Just over half the patients in this present cohort may be physically able to undertake some aspects of self-managed foot care, including nail clipping and filing, callus filing and daily hygiene and inspection.", "prediction_text": "The FOOTSTEP self-management foot care programme is generally accessible to older rheumatoid arthritis patients, but some may have difficulty passing tests for reach and grip strength. Older patients with longer disease duration, higher physical disability, pain, and general health scores are more likely to fail these tests."}
{"answers": "The homogeneity we found in the deprivation-mortality relationship across the regions of Scotland and the absence of a contextualized effect of region highlights the importance of taking a broader strategic policy that can combat the toxic impacts of socio-economic deprivation on health. Focusing on a few specific places (e.g. 15% of the poorest areas) to concentrate resources might be a good start but the impact of socio-economic deprivation on mortality is not restricted to a few places. A comprehensive strategy that can be sustained over time might be needed to interrupt the linkages between poverty and mortality.", "prediction_text": "The study found that deprivation is significantly correlated with all-cause mortality in all models, but there is no evidence of spatial heterogeneity in this relationship between the West and the rest of Scotland."}
{"answers": "This study adds to the growing body of literature documenting the importance of the individual therapist as an important factor in the change process.", "prediction_text": "The study found that approximately 12% of the variability in the outcome of cognitive processing therapy for PTSD in a VA clinic could be attributed to therapists, highlighting the importance of consistent implementation of evidence-based treatments. Effective therapists were identified as those who addressed patient avoidance, used effective language in supervision, had a flexible interpersonal style, and developed strong therapeutic alliances."}
{"answers": "New depression diagnosis and antidepressant use was shown to be less likely in areas of higher own-ethnic density for some, but not all, ethnic groups.", "prediction_text": "The study found that black and minority ethnic groups, including Pakistani, Indian, African, and Bangladeshi patients, were less likely to be newly diagnosed with depression or prescribed antidepressants compared to white British patients. An increase in own-ethnic density in the neighborhood was associated with a reduced odds of depression for Pakistani, Indian, African, and Bangladeshi patients, but an increased odds for black Caribbean patients. The findings were consistent for antidepressant prescribing, although the effect for black Caribbean patients was no longer statistically significant."}
{"answers": "These findings suggest a malleable relationship between knee extensor strength, dynamic stability, and disease severity in PD. Although strength is only one piece of the puzzle in the functional outcome of PD, these findings may assist clinicians in designing appropriate interventions aimed at increasing function and decreasing fall risk in PD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, knee extensor strength is positively related to dynamic stability and negatively related to disease severity in Parkinson's disease. Dynamic stability is also negatively related to disease severity and positively related to functional ambulation. The Functional Reach Test may be a valuable tool to assess postural stability."}
{"answers": "It is concluded that preloading colloid fluid prior to repositioning could prevent the decrease of systolic blood pressure and central venous pressure during sitting positioning without other complications.", "prediction_text": "Yes, according to the study, preloading neurosurgical patients with colloids before seated positioning significantly maintains systolic blood pressure and central venous pressure compared to crystalloid maintenance alone."}
{"answers": "Data from Safe Implementation of Treatments in Stroke-International Stroke Thrombolysis Register suggest that intravenous thrombolysis may modify the observed survival and recovery advantage for men expected in the natural course of an ischemic stroke, with a possible larger beneficial treatment effect in women when compared with men.", "prediction_text": "The study found no difference in the safety and efficacy of intravenous thrombolysis between men and women regarding functional outcome. However, women had a higher mortality rate and a slightly higher risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage than men after adjusting for confounding variables."}
{"answers": "The rate of early infection without antibiotic prophylaxis before TIVAD placement in the interventional radiology suite is<1%. Based on these data, use of prophylactic antibiotics for TIVAD placement is not recommended.", "prediction_text": "Based on this study, the rate of early CLABSIs in TIVADs placed without antibiotic prophylaxis was 0.6%. One patient who received an antibiotic the day of implantation developed a CLABSI. These findings suggest that the use of prophylactic antibiotics for TIVAD placement by interventional radiologists may not be necessary in all cases. However, individual patient risk factors should be considered."}
{"answers": "The PRP group recorded reduced pain, swelling, and trismus as well as enhanced and faster bone healing compared with those in the control. Hence the study showed that topical application of PRP gel has a beneficial effect in enhancing socket healing after third molar surgery.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the application of autologous platelet-rich plasma gel during surgical extraction of mandibular third molars may lead to a decrease in postoperative pain, but its effect on healing and bone regeneration, as measured by lamina dura, trabecular pattern, and bone density, was not statistically significant."}
{"answers": "This study confirms that physicians often differ from patients in the assessment of QoL. This is most likely due to a difference in patient-physician perception of \"significant\" LUTS and clearly demonstrates the importance of patient evaluated QoL in routine clinical assessment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found a relatively poor concordance between patient and physician assessments of quality of life using the Kings Health Questionnaire, with physicians tending to underestimate the impact of lower urinary tract symptoms on patients in certain domains, particularly social limitations and emotions."}
{"answers": "Left ventricular dimensions are not influenced by MetS. Rather than MetS, hypertension is primarily responsible for changes in left ventricular dimensions. However, left atrial enlargement is more prominent in patients with MetS, suggesting that each MetS criterion contributes to left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.", "prediction_text": "Yes, metabolic syndrome is associated with increased left atrial diameter in hypertensive patients."}
{"answers": "A higher PV in PMR increases the risk of prolonged steroid therapy and late GCA. Female sex and particular HLA alleles may increase the risk of late GCA. Starting patients on>15 mg prednisolone is associated with a prolonged steroid duration.", "prediction_text": "Elevated plasma viscosity and high initial prednisolone dose at disease onset are independent predictors of a longer steroid therapy duration in polymyalgia rheumatica. Additionally, female sex, HLA-DRB1*0101 or -*0401 alleles, elevated plasma viscosity, and high initial prednisolone dose may increase the risk of late developing giant cell arteritis. However, no significant predictors of relapse were identified in this study."}
{"answers": "The study suggests that there is no difference in clinical toxicity profiles or survival outcomes with either definitive chemoradiotherapy or chemoradiation followed by surgery in management of locally advanced esophageal cancer.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests no significant overall survival or disease-free survival benefit with surgical resection after chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus (p\u2009>\u20090.05 for both). However, the probability of locoregional recurrence was higher in the arm without surgery (p\u2009=\u20090.002)."}
{"answers": "Our results give first evidence that lowered beta E during alcohol withdrawal may contribute to anxiety as a common disturbance during this state.", "prediction_text": "The study found an inverse relationship between beta-endorphin levels and self-reported anxiety during alcohol withdrawal, with significantly lower beta-endorphin levels on day 1 and day 14 compared to healthy controls. This correlation was independent of ACTH levels, suggesting a potential role of beta-endorphin deficiency in withdrawal-induced anxiety in alcoholism."}
{"answers": "Increased private health care activity does not reduce the demand for NHS care: NHS and private referral rates were positively associated with each other after adjusting for age, deprivation and practice.", "prediction_text": "The study found that private referral rates were lower in more deprived areas and NHS referral rates were slightly higher, suggesting that increased use of private health care may not necessarily reduce the demand for NHS care. However, NHS referral rates were higher in areas with higher private referral rates, indicating a potential redistribution of demand rather than a reduction."}
{"answers": "Skewed X-inactivation is not associated with recurrent spontaneous abortion but is associated with increasing maternal age.", "prediction_text": "The study found no statistically significant association between recurrent spontaneous abortion and skewed X-inactivation, except for a higher rate in the primiparous group compared to the recurrent spontaneous abortion group (1.0% vs. 8.6%, P<.01). The incidence of skewing was similar in women with or without previous live births. However, women with extreme skewing were on average 2 years older than those without skewing (P<.05)."}
{"answers": "Findings suggest that analgesic management of daily pain is better for nursing home residents enrolled in hospice than for those not enrolled in hospice.The prescribing practices portrayed by this study reveal that many dying nursing home residents in daily pain are receiving no analgesic treatment or are receiving analgesic treatment inconsistent with AMDA and other pain management guidelines. Improving the analgesic management of pain in nursing homes is essential if high-quality end-of-life care in nursing homes is to be achieved.", "prediction_text": "Yes, hospice care in nursing homes is associated with a higher likelihood of receiving regular treatment for daily pain near the end of life (adjusted odds ratio = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.68-2.56). Hospice residents also less frequently received analgesics not recommended by AMDA compared to non-hospice residents (OR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.52-0.80)."}
{"answers": "The continuity-of-care experiences of vascular trainees are suboptimal. This is especially true for postoperative clinic assessment. Same-day admission surgery accounted for most of the cases and was associated with the poorest continuity of care. To provide complete surgical training in an era of changing therapeutic modalities and same-day admission surgery, vascular programs must be creative in structuring training to include adequate ambulatory experience.", "prediction_text": "The study found that residents in an academic vascular department had a low rate of complete in-hospital continuity of care (57%), with significant differences based on case type. Preoperative assessment and involvement in decision-making were more common for elective inpatients compared to same-day admission patients (P<.05). Emergent cases had a higher rate of preoperative assessment (92% vs 63%, P<.05). These findings suggest that residents may not be gaining comprehensive experience in all aspects of surgical care."}
{"answers": "Simple detorsion was not accompanied by an increase in morbidity, and all patients studied had functioning ovarian tissue on follow-up despite the surgeon's assessment of the degree of ovarian ischemia. Detorsion is the procedure of choice for most cases of ovarian torsion in children.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that detorsion alone may be an effective treatment for ovarian torsion in children, as shown by normal follicular development in follow-up imaging despite intraoperative signs of ischemia. However, the decision to perform detorsion or oophorectomy may depend on clinical suspicion and timing of surgery."}
{"answers": "Half-dose MR angiography using diluted contrast medium injected at a rate of 1 mL/second depicted the abdominal aorta and its branches as clearly as using a full single dose.", "prediction_text": "The study found that half-dose contrast-enhanced MR angiography had lower signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios, and image quality was not statistically significantly different from full-dose MR angiography for the abdominal aorta and pelvis. However, the SNR and CNR of the common iliac artery were significantly lower in the half-dose group. Therefore, the sufficiency of half-dose MR angiography for the abdominal aorta and pelvis is questionable due to the potential impact on image quality in the common iliac artery."}
{"answers": "There was no evidence of a trend in unsafe sex behaviour over time. However, several subgroups were identified as being more likely to report unsafe sex and should be targeted for specific interventions.", "prediction_text": "Based on the data from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study, there is no evidence of an increase in reported unsafe sex over time among HIV-infected individuals. However, certain groups, including females, young adults, those with HIV-positive partners, and those with occasional partners, were more likely to report unsafe sex."}
{"answers": "In normal clinical practice, chemotherapy significantly prolongs survival in patients with performance status of less than 2, more time being gained if there is no associated weight loss. We conclude that the reluctance shown by many pneumologists toward using this treatment is not entirely justified.", "prediction_text": "The study found that cytostatic treatment was an independent predictor of longer survival in advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma patients with ECOG scores of 0 to 1, along with absence of weight loss. These findings suggest that chemotherapy's advantage in clinical trials can be observed in normal healthcare activity, partially addressing pneumologists' skepticism towards this treatment."}
{"answers": "The Medicaid Demonstration in Florida appears to result in lower PMPM expenditures. Demonstration PSNs generated slightly greater reductions in expenditures compared to Demonstration HMOs. PSNs appear to be a promising model for delivering care to Medicaid enrollees.", "prediction_text": "According to the research, Florida's Medicaid Demonstration showed that Provider Service Networks (PSNs) resulted in lower PMPM expenditures compared to HMOs among SSI enrollees, with a savings of $7 per month. This trend was also observed among TANF enrollees but to a lesser extent."}
{"answers": "In this series, in accordance to available testosterone, the prevalence of PADAM was determined to be high, in which the ADAM questionnaire rendered a low diagnostic efficiency. PADAM diagnosis could be clinically suspected when symptoms of sexual dysfunction are present.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the Androgen Deficiency of Aging Men (ADAM) questionnaire identified 81.3% of men as possible cases of Partial Androgen Deficiency of Aging Men (PADAM), but only 28.1% of these cases were confirmed by low available testosterone levels. The questionnaire had a sensitivity of 83.3% and specificity of 19.7% for PADAM detection. Item 1 (decreased sexual desire) had a higher predictive value for hypogonadism than the complete questionnaire."}
{"answers": "We found that intrapartum VAS was an effective predictor of fetal acidosis in cases of FHR variable decelerations, but its predictability for fetal acidosis in cases of FHR late decelerations was limited. Both VAS and fetal blood pH are good predictors of neonatal morbidity.", "prediction_text": "The study found an excellent association between a negative response to intrapartum vibroacoustic stimulation (VAS) and fetal acidosis (pH<7.20) in both term and preterm gestations (p = 0.0001, OR = 10.6 [3.3-34.0]). However, the false negative rate of acceleration VAS response for predicting no acidosis was significantly higher in the group of late decelerations (29% vs 8%, p = 0.034). Both a negative VAS response and fetal acidosis have equal predictability for neonatal morbidity, but the"}
{"answers": "Emergency US fellowship programs had a positive impact on residents' US educational experiences. Emergency medicine residents performed more scans overall and also used bedside US for more advanced applications in programs with EUS fellowships.", "prediction_text": "Yes, emergency ultrasound fellowship programs are associated with increased number of ultrasound examinations performed and a broader scope of bedside ultrasound applications among emergency medicine residents. However, there are also significant differences in barriers to US education between programs with and without fellowships."}
{"answers": "Obesity does not seem to impact the severity of injury, mortality rate, types of injury, and procedure outcomes in children. Obese patients are more likely to have rib and pelvic injuries.", "prediction_text": "Obesity is associated with higher injury severity score, lower pediatric trauma score, and increased likelihood of rib fractures and pelvic injuries in children, but there is no significant association between obesity and mortality in this trauma population."}
{"answers": "The laparoscopic-assisted approach to Crohn's disease is feasible and safe with good outcomes. Co-morbid preoperative findings such as abscess, phlegmon, or recurrent disease at the previous ileocolic anastomosis are not contraindications to a successful laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resection in select patients.", "prediction_text": "The study found that laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resections in patients with Crohn's disease can be successfully performed in the presence of abscesses or phlegmons, as well as recurrent disease at a previous anastomosis, with less operative blood loss, shorter operative time, lower morbidity, and shorter hospital stay compared to open procedures. However, these benefits were not significant in the absence of these factors."}
{"answers": "When controlling for preoperative features, the year in which RP was performed is a predictor of outcome on multivariate analysis. This effect could not be explained by stage migration.", "prediction_text": "The year of radical prostatectomy was found to be a predictor of outcome on preoperative analysis but not on postoperative analysis, suggesting that improvements in surgical techniques and patient selection may have contributed to better outcomes in more recent years, with the greatest improvements observed through the mid 1990s."}
{"answers": "The menopausal transition warrants attention as a period of vulnerability to MDD recurrence, while health factors and VMS should be considered important risk factors for first lifetime-onset of MDD during midlife.", "prediction_text": "The study found that women without prior major depression had different risk factors for first-onset major depression during midlife compared to women with a prior history of major depression. Health conditions prior to baseline and during follow-ups, perception of functioning, and vasomotor symptoms were risk factors for first-onset major depression. Being peri- and post-menopausal, psychological symptoms, and a prior anxiety disorder were predominant risk factors for major depression recurrence."}
{"answers": "Most children undergoing congenital heart surgery can be extubated in the operating room. Most neonates, including many undergoing complex procedures, can be extubated within the first 24 hours after surgery. Early extubation was associated with low morbidity rates and short lengths of intensive care unit and hospital stays.", "prediction_text": "Yes, early extubation within 24 hours after congenital heart surgery in children, including neonates, is associated with lower mortality and reintubation rates, as well as shorter lengths of ICU and hospital stays. Factors predictive of delayed extubation include preoperative mechanical ventilation, low weight, longer procedure time, and the need for postoperative inotrope support."}
{"answers": "A significant association between farming and PSV has been identified for the first time. Results also support previously reported associations with silica, solvents, and allergy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the research paper found that farming in the index year and high occupational exposures to silica, solvents, and drugs were significantly associated with an increased risk of primary systemic vasculitis, specifically Wegener's granulomatosis, microscopic polyangiitis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-positive cases."}
{"answers": "This study that shows that adequate femoral tunnel lengths can be safely created without knee hyperflex - ion using flexible instruments via an anteromedial portal.", "prediction_text": "The study shows that with a flexible reamer system, femoral tunnel lengths greater than 20 mm can be created at 90\u00b0 of knee flexion. However, there is a trend toward longer distances to the common peroneal nerve with increased flexion, with a statistically significant difference between 120\u00b0 and 70\u00b0 flexion."}
{"answers": "A proportionally longer treatment duration was identified as an adverse factor in low-risk patients. Treatment breaks resulting in a NTDR of>/=33% (e.g., four or more breaks during a 40-fraction treatment, 5 d/wk) should be avoided.", "prediction_text": "Yes, longer treatment durations are associated with a higher risk of biochemical failure in low-risk prostate cancer patients. (NTDR<33% had a 10-year FFBF rate of 82% vs. 57% for NTDR>/=33% in this group, p = 0.0019). The NTDR was an independent predictor of FFBF in addition to T stage and initial PSA level. However, this effect was not significant in intermediate-risk, high-risk groups, or the entire cohort."}
{"answers": "TEE allowed a diagnosis of site involvement that did correlate with the anatomic diagnosis obtained during the operation. This fact contributed to the management of patients and was of great help in guiding the surgical intervention. Echo-oriented single-valve replacement may be a safe strategy for patients with PVE and double prostheses.", "prediction_text": "The study found that single-valve replacement was a viable option in 13 out of 17 patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis and only one infected valve. However, four of these patients died within a week post-surgery. The remaining nine patients survived, completed antimicrobial therapy, and were considered cured with no relapses during follow-up. The preoperative diagnosis of the site of infection using transesophageal echocardiogram had a 100% positive predictive value."}
{"answers": "Acute hepatitis C in the post universal blood products screening era was found to be predominantly an iatrogenic disease in the investigated localities. This finding should direct attention and resources towards the development and implementation of preventive measures.", "prediction_text": "Yes, in this Israeli study, iatrogenic transmission was the most frequent mode of acute hepatitis C infection, accounting for 65% of cases."}
{"answers": "Our results suggest a protective effect of breast-feeding among children with a family history of atopy that is not confined to the period of breast-feeding but continues during the first three years of life. Breast-feeding should be promoted in children with a family history of atopy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, according to this study, breast-feeding was associated with lower rates of illness in children with a family history of atopy, including fewer episodes of gastroenteritis, lower respiratory tract infections, digestive tract disorders, respiratory tract infections, and skin infections during the first three years of life."}
{"answers": "Transrectal ultrasound guided and fusion biopsy cancer detection rates decreased with increasing prostate volume. However, magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy had a higher prostate cancer detection rate compared to that of transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy in the literature. Magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy represents a promising solution for patients with suspicion of prostate cancer and an enlarged prostate.", "prediction_text": "Yes, magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy improves cancer detection in enlarged prostates, particularly for those with volumes greater than 40 cc, as shown in the study with a detection rate of 55%, compared to 30.4% or less for larger prostates (p<0.0001). The study also found an inverse association between magnetic resonance imaging volume and prostate cancer detection, controlling for age and prostate specific antigen."}
{"answers": "There is no difference in postoperative morbidity, rates of rehospitalization, in-patient mortality or hospitalization costs in geriatric patients undergoing regional or general anesthesia for repair of hip fracture. Delay in surgery beyond 3 days and ICU admission both increase cost of hospitalization.", "prediction_text": "The study found no significant difference in hospitalization costs, morbidity, or mortality between geriatric patients with hip fracture who received regional anesthesia versus general anesthesia. However, delay in surgery and ICU admission were associated with increased hospitalization costs."}
{"answers": "Mesocolon invasion should be included in T4 for the staging of gastric cancer.", "prediction_text": "Based on the study, direct mesocolon invasion could be considered an extension of T3 gastric cancer, but its inclusion in T4 stage should be further evaluated as the study suggests that while the prognosis is worse than T3, survival after curative resection is better than those with incurable factors."}
{"answers": "Genetic variants identified in the present study may be insufficient to promote early carotid atherosclerosis.", "prediction_text": "Contrary to observational data, this study found no significant difference in carotid intima-media thickness between individuals with mutations causing low HDL-C and controls."}
{"answers": "The Turkish version of the EQ-5D-based utility score seems to be a valid instrument in the assessment of quality of life studies in patients with acute coronary syndrome.", "prediction_text": "The study provides evidence for the construct validity of the Turkish version of the EQ-5D in patients with acute coronary syndrome, as indicated by significant correlations with MacNew subscales and the MacNew global score being a significant predictor of the EQ-5D index score."}
{"answers": "We found an improved survival associated with cardiologist care and a mixture of general practitioner and cardiologist care compared with general practitioner care. The pattern of outpatient care may therefore be important for the survival of patients with CHF.", "prediction_text": "The study found that patients with congestive heart failure who received care from both general medicine and cardiology clinics had a lower risk of death compared to those who received care from only general medicine or cardiology clinics, or no clinic visits at all. However, the absolute risk reduction was modest and the difference in survival was not large between the MIXED and other groups."}
{"answers": "Comparison of mother-offspring and father-offspring associations for BMI suggests that intergenerational acceleration mechanisms do not make an important contribution to levels of childhood BMI within the population. Associations at later ages and for different components of body composition now require study.", "prediction_text": "The research paper did not find evidence to support the hypothesis that maternal BMI has a stronger association with offspring obesity at age 7.5 than paternal BMI, suggesting that any intrauterine influence on obesity may not be significant in this population."}
{"answers": "TEE is useful to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors. An FAC less than 50% is present in 36% of potential heart donors. Because left ventricular dysfunction is often reversible shortly after transplantation, an FAC below 50% may not necessarily preclude the use of hearts for transplantation.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that heart donors with an FAC (Fractional Area Change) below 50% as assessed by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) before harvesting had lower success rates in heart transplantation compared to donors with an FAC over 50%. However, there was no significant difference in actuarial survival between the two groups at 1 and 2 years. The study indicates that hearts with an FAC below 50% may still be suitable for transplantation, but the results should be interpreted with caution."}
{"answers": "Pediatricians should be alert to the earliest manifestations of AEA. Awareness of choking games among the young and, of those, a subset who eventually progress to potentially fatal AEA is strongly encouraged among all primary care professionals who may be able to interrupt the behavior.", "prediction_text": "Autoerotic asphyxiation (AEA) among children, preteens, and adolescents involves intentional hypoxia/anoxia to enhance sexual excitement, which can result in unintended death. This clandestine practice can be identified by pediatricians, allowing for discussion, distress alleviation, and potential prevention. Characterized by a ritualized and symbolic biopsychosocial drama, AEA can lead to fatal outcomes due to miscalculation of risk."}
{"answers": "The whole-body MRI protocol for the detection of bone metastases could safely be limited to the T1w sequence in adults, especially at 3 T. There is no need for an additional STIR sequence. These initial results will have a major impact on the department's workflow if confirmed by larger studies as they will help reduce examination time and therefore save financial resources.", "prediction_text": "Based on this study, T1-weighted imaging showed superior diagnostic performance for bone metastases compared to STIR imaging at both 1.5 T and 3 T, with higher sensitivity and better lesion conspicuity, delineation, and image quality. Therefore, omitting STIR imaging in the diagnosis of bone metastases at 1.5 T and 3 T may be considered."}
{"answers": "This study found that there was poor agreement between the AD's decision and the subsequent MR's decision regarding the fitness of those seafarers who decided to appeal against the AD's initial assessment. The reasons for this are considered.", "prediction_text": "The agreement between Approved Doctors and Medical Referees in the UK when assessing a seafarer's fitness is poor (Kappa K = 0.18). Differences in fitness categories were mainly due to access to additional information for mental ill-health and cardiovascular diseases, and factors such as the experience and knowledge of the Medical Referees or their interpretation of standards for all other conditions."}
{"answers": "In our study, we suggest that glomerular hyperfiltration due to pregnancy does not have adverse effects on kidney in women with more parities. Pregnancy may have possible protective mechanisms for kidney against adverse effects of glomerular hyperfiltration.", "prediction_text": "The study found that women with four or more parities had significantly higher glomerular filtration rates (GFR) compared to women with no or one parity or two or three parities. However, the paper does not provide evidence that this hyperfiltration leads to kidney damage. Further research is needed to determine if the long-term consequences of this increased GFR in multiparous women are detrimental to kidney health."}
{"answers": "Implant coating with an antibacterial-loaded hydrogel reduces bacterial colonization and biofilm formation in vitro.", "prediction_text": "Yes, according to the study, implant coating with antibacterial-loaded DAC hydrogel reduces bacterial colonization and biofilm formation in vitro. The hydrogel delivered antibacterial agents effectively and exhibited bactericidal and antibiofilm activity. Despite some coating loss during press-fit insertion, approximately 80% of the hydrogel remained on the implant."}
{"answers": "Location of death varies by country of birth. BAME groups are more likely to die in a hospital and less likely to die at home or in a hospice. Further investigation is needed to determine whether these differences result from patient-centred preferences, or other environment or service-related factors. This knowledge will enable strategies to be developed to improve access to relevant palliative care and related services, where necessary.", "prediction_text": "Yes, ethnicity is associated with a higher likelihood of dying in a hospital for some BAME groups, particularly those born in Asia and Africa, while home deaths are less likely for those from the Caribbean. However, the trend towards more home deaths and fewer hospital deaths over the study period did not eliminate consistent ethnicity-related gaps. Hospice deaths showed varying patterns across ethnicities."}
{"answers": "Overall, 7% of women in our cohort met either clinical or molecular criteria for Lynch syndrome. All of these women had a prior history or a first-degree relative with an HNPCC-associated cancer. Limiting genetic evaluation to women with synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancer who have a family history suggestive of HNPCC may appropriately identify women with Lynch syndrome.", "prediction_text": "Five of the medium-risk women with synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancers had molecular findings suggestive of a Lynch syndrome germline mutation in MSH2 or MLH1. The low-risk women did not."}
{"answers": "CMV-IgM and IgG antibodies assessment was not a potential discriminative test to identify congenitally infected newborns. In addition, low birth weight and small head circumference at birth failed to predict congenital CMV infection. CMV-DNA detection in umbilical cord blood at the time of delivery using real-time PCR of all newborns is recommended as decisive, rapid and non-invasive test.", "prediction_text": "While the majority of newborns with low birth weight had no evidence of congenital cytomegalovirus infection based on the study, a small percentage (4 out of 200) with normal birth weight also tested positive for CMV-DNA. Therefore, low birth weight is not a definitive indicator for congenital cytomegalovirus infection."}
{"answers": "The use of instrumental variables allowed us to demonstrate a significant relationship between better ambulatory process of care and better health-related quality of life. This finding underscores the importance of efforts to improve the process of care.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that better process of care in ambulatory settings is associated with smaller declines in health-related quality of life (SF-12 physical component scores) for patients with chronic diseases, even after adjusting for burden of illness (p=.014). Implementing the best quartile of process of care for patients with poor process could result in a 4.24 point improvement in SF-12 physical component summary scores."}
{"answers": "To date, the newly developed Singapore equation is the most accurate BMR prediction equation in Chinese and is applicable for use in a large BMI range including those overweight and obese.", "prediction_text": "The new BMR prediction equation developed for Chinese adults in this study showed a higher accuracy rate (78%) compared to several existing equations (Harris-Benedict, Henry, Liu, Yang, Owen, and Mifflin) for the whole range of BMI. However, for a BMI greater than 23, the new equation had similar accuracy (76%) to the existing equations. Therefore, the applicability of current prediction equations for estimating BMR in Chinese adults may vary, and the new equation presented in this study could be a more accurate option."}
{"answers": "This preliminary study demonstrated that OSCE ratings by LEs and REs were reasonably comparable when using checklists. Remote examination may be a feasible and acceptable way of assessing students' clinical skills, but further validity evidence will be required before it can be recommended for use in high-stakes examinations.", "prediction_text": "The study found statistically significant correlations between on-site and remote physician-examiners' scores in history taking, physical examination, and management stations during an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE). However, correlations for global ratings were more varied. The acceptance of the remote OSCE (reOSCE) was high among both examiners and students, despite technological issues. The results suggest that remote physician-examiners can participate in OSCEs to help bridge the gap in distributed medical education."}
{"answers": "ACR is an independent prognostic factor for maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes in suspected preeclampsia. ACR may be useful to inform risk predictions within a prognostic model.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a higher first urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) in women with suspected preeclampsia is associated with an increased odds of both maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes, as well as a reduced gestational age at delivery. (odds ratio for maternal outcome: 1.60, 95% CI 1.45-1.80; odds ratio for neonatal outcome: 1.15, 95% CI 1.02-1.29; coefficient for gestational age: -0.46, 95% CI -0.54 to -0.38)"}
{"answers": "The effect on venous pressures caused by the change in patient positioning alone during liver surgery does not affect the risk of venous air embolism.", "prediction_text": "The study found no pressure gradient between central and hepatic venous levels in any patient position during liver surgery, suggesting that patient position, specifically head-down tilt, does not significantly influence the risk of venous air embolism."}
{"answers": "The observations from this study provide limited support for the possibility that occupational arsenic exposure could play a role in the development of diabetes mellitus. Many other metallic compounds are also used in art glass production, however, and there is a possibility of confounding.", "prediction_text": "The study found a slightly elevated risk of diabetes mellitus among glassworks employees in southeastern Sweden, with a stronger association for those with cardiovascular disease. Glassblowers, foundry workers, and unspecified glassworkers had a higher risk, especially for unspecified glass workers who likely had higher arsenic exposure (MH-OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-2.8)."}
{"answers": "Hospital preparedness can be better defined by a fixed number of casualties rather than a percentile of its bed capacity. Only 20% of the arriving casualties will require immediate medical treatment. Implementation of this concept may improve the utilisation of national emergency health resources both in the preparation phase and on real time.", "prediction_text": "The study found that in 79.2% of HMCIs, less than half of the casualties required immediate medical treatment. The mean number of arriving casualties was 20.8, with 95% of incidents having a casualty load of less than 52. These findings suggest that the current Israeli hospital surge capacity guidelines for multiple casualty incidents may be overestimated based on the epidemiology of encountered HMCIs."}
{"answers": "While Italian primary care physicians appropriately target eradication therapy for H pylori infection in patients with peptic ulcer disease rather than nonulcer disease, the intervention was still underused in these patients. Improvements in this prescribing behavior are needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, primary care physicians underprescribe eradication therapy for peptic ulcer disease, particularly for those with a presumptive diagnosis, as shown by a significant difference in prescription rates between patients with peptic ulcer disease and nonulcer dyspepsia (27.6% vs. 2%)."}
{"answers": "When cerebral hemispherectomy is performed to control seizures associated with very early (in utero) insult, it has been found that the remaining right hemisphere is still able to support reading and phonological processing skills that are normally mediated by the left hemisphere. Our results also suggest the existence of variability in individuals after hemispherectomy, even within groups having the same etiology and similar timing of insult.", "prediction_text": "The study found that about 60% of individuals who underwent left cerebral hemispherectomy for intractable seizures developed average reading skills, with unexpectedly preserved phonological processing abilities mediated by the right hemisphere. Phonological awareness and verbal memory, components of phonological processing, correlated with word reading levels, and receptive vocabulary size, a bilateral function, was also preserved to some extent. Later seizure onset was associated with better reading levels."}
{"answers": "Improved office-based practices regarding influenza vaccination could significantly impact Healthy People 2020 goals by increasing influenza vaccine uptake and reducing corresponding racial and ethnic disparities.", "prediction_text": "Yes, reducing \"missed opportunities\" for influenza vaccination in office-based settings could nearly eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in adult influenza vaccination."}
{"answers": "The SPI was accurate in predicting the presence or absence of esophageal varices in patients with compensated cirrhosis.", "prediction_text": "Yes, non-invasive diagnosis of esophageal varices in patients with compensated hepatic cirrhosis is possible using duplex Doppler ultrasonography, specifically by evaluating the splenoportal index (SPI). A SPI value of 5.0 offers the highest diagnostic accuracy (88%) for predicting the presence or absence of esophageal varices. Patients with SPI less than 5.0 have a high negative predictive value (96%) and sensitivity (96%) for the absence of esophageal varices, while those with SPI 5.0 or higher have a high positive predictive value (79%) and specificity (82%) for"}
{"answers": "This study showed for the first time that RALP induces lower tissue trauma than RRP.", "prediction_text": "Based on the given research, the data suggests that radical retropubic prostatectomy resulted in higher acute phase inflammatory responses, as indicated by increased levels of IL-6 and C-reactive protein, and lactate at various time points post-surgery, compared to robotically assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy. These findings suggest that RALP may be less invasive than RRP."}
{"answers": "The researchers studied a defined skin care protocol using a cleanser with aloe vera and a cleansing lotion, followed by application of either a moisture barrier with silicone or skin protectant with zinc oxide and menthol, undertaken at two different frequencies. Data revealed the incidence of moderate IAD was decreased in the experimental group (receiving the skin protocol every 6 hours and p.r.n.).", "prediction_text": "Yes, more frequent skin care with a gentle cleanser, moisturizer, and skin protectant/barrier reduces the severity of incontinence-associated dermatitis in critically ill patients (7.1% in the intervention group vs. 10.9% in the control group, P \u2264 0.001)."}
{"answers": "Patient coaching offers promise as a means of reducing racial/ethnic disparities in pain control. Larger studies are needed to validate these findings and to explore possible mechanisms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that patient coaching can help reduce racial/ethnic disparities in cancer pain control, as evidenced by a significant decrease in pain disparities between minority and white patients in the experimental group."}
{"answers": "The association between plasma glucose levels and CVD risk is mainly explained by insulin resistance, which raises the question of whether glucose lowering per se without changes in the processes that underlie hyperglycemia should be the sole clinical paradigm in the treatment of type 2 diabetes or its prevention.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that insulin resistance explains the association between hyperglycemia and increased cardiovascular risk, as the relationship between fasting and 2-hour post-glucose load plasma glucose levels and cardiovascular risk was no longer significant after adjusting for insulin sensitivity. However, insulin sensitivity remained significantly associated with lower cardiovascular risk."}
{"answers": "Tracheobronchoscopy is a useful and safe procedure and should be recommended in tertiary centers for babies with EA before surgical repair.", "prediction_text": "Yes, preoperative tracheobronchoscopy in newborns with esophageal atresia can matter significantly. This procedure can reveal unsuspected fistulas, malformations of the respiratory tree, and improve surgical planning, making it crucial in 24.2% of cases."}
{"answers": "The recently released seventh edition of the primary tumor staging system for kidney tumors is a powerful predictor of CSS. However, some of the substages identified by the classification have overlapping prognoses, and other substages include patients with heterogeneous outcomes. The few modifications included in this edition may have not resolved the most critical issues in the previous version.", "prediction_text": "The study validated the 2009 TNM edition for primary tumor classification in kidney cancer, showing that the new subclassifications of T2, T3a, and T4 had significant independent predictive value for cancer-specific survival. However, the substratification of pT1 tumors did not retain an independent predictive role, and limitations include the retrospective design, lack of central pathologic review, and small number of patients in some substages. Further studies with prospective design and central pathologic review are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "The Young-Burgess system is useful for predicting transfusion requirements. For the system to predict mortality or nonorthopaedic injuries, fractures must be divided into stable (APC1, LC1) and unstable (APC2, APC3, LC2, LC3, VS, combined mechanism of injury) types. LC1 injuries are very common and not always benign (overall mortality rate, 8.2%).", "prediction_text": "The Young-Burgess classification system approaches statistical significance in predicting mortality but is more effective in identifying transfusion requirements, particularly in lateral compression Type 3 and anteroposterior compression Types 2 and 3 fractures. However, it is less accurate in predicting non-orthopaedic injuries such as head, chest, or abdomen injuries. Dividing fractures into stable and unstable types improves the system's ability to predict mortality rates and transfusion requirements. Mortality rates have remained unchanged over the past 15 years."}
{"answers": "Parity is not directly linked to insulin sensitivity deterioration, to CP/FPG increase during pregnancy, or to GDM appearance, although it is linked through the mediation of progressive ageing and weight gain either before or during pregnancy, when there is a sufficiently long time interval between pregnancies.", "prediction_text": "Parity is associated with decreased insulin sensitivity during pregnancy, as indicated by a lower peripheral insulin sensitivity index, but this relationship is no longer significant after adjusting for age, pregestational BMI, and weight gain. Parity is also linked to an increased risk of gestational diabetes, which is also age-dependent. However, the study does not definitively establish that parity directly causes insulin resistance."}
{"answers": "The relationship between cognitive functioning and recognition of frequency compressed speech-in-noise was not statistically significant. The findings may have been different if the participants had been provided with training and/or time to 'acclimatize' to the frequency-compressed conditions.", "prediction_text": "In this study, cognitive function did not significantly predict frequency compressed speech recognition in listeners with normal hearing and normal cognition. However, there was a significant relationship between cognitive function and unprocessed speech recognition."}
{"answers": "We conclude that beta1Gly49 homozygosity and TACC haplotype of ADRB2 gene, both loss-of-function genetic variations, may predispose to TTN.", "prediction_text": "The study identified an association between the beta1Ser49Gly polymorphism in the ADRB1 gene and an increased risk for Transient Tachypnea of the Newborn (TTN) in Caucasian infants. Additionally, a significant association was found between the T-47C, A46G, C79G, and C491T (TACC) haplotype in the ADRB2 gene and TTN (p = 0.048)."}
{"answers": "MSWM does not appear to confer additional benefit as compared to the standard preoperative bariatric surgery protocol in terms of weight loss and most behavioral outcomes after LAGB in our patient population.", "prediction_text": "The study found no significant difference in weight loss outcomes between patients who participated in a preoperative medically supervised weight loss program and those who did not, after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding surgery. However, a positive effect on physical activity was observed in the group that participated in the program."}
{"answers": "TAVI can be performed safely without balloon predilatation and with the same early results as achieved with the standard procedure including balloon predilatation. The reduction in the number of pacing periods required may be beneficial for the patient.", "prediction_text": "The study found no significant difference in early hemodynamic results or complication rates between TAVI patients with and without balloon predilatation. Therefore, predilatation may be omitted in TAVI procedures."}
{"answers": "In our study; sex is not a significant predictor of recanalization rate, time to recanalization or 3-month outcome in stroke patients following IV rt-PA.", "prediction_text": "The research paper did not find a significant difference in the effectiveness of rt-PA between men and women based on recanalization rates and poor 3-month outcomes."}
{"answers": "Serum sample might be alternatively used in the difficult time of getting tumor tissue for analyzing the status of EGFR mutation status in patients with advanced NSCLC.", "prediction_text": "Yes, serum samples can be used for analyzing EGFR mutation status in advanced NSCLC with a high correlation and consistency with tumor samples, and the response to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors is significantly associated with the presence of EGFR mutations in both serum and tumor samples. However, there is no significant difference in overall survival according to the EGFR mutation status in both serum and tumor samples."}
{"answers": "Although the provision of high-quality evidence-based resources, electronic or otherwise, is essential for standardizing care and improving patient outcomes, the authors' findings demonstrate that this alone does not ensure uptake. It is important to understand end-users, the environment in which they operate, and the basic infrastructure required to implement such a system. Implementation must also be accompanied by continuing education and endorsement to ensure both long-term sustainability and use of the system to its full potential.", "prediction_text": "Web-based systems can play a major role in standardizing care and improving patient outcomes in medical oncology, but their uptake and use vary based on hospital location, clinician roles, experience, hospital policy, endorsement, infrastructure availability, and education received."}
{"answers": "This study has shown that being SGA was not a significant risk factor for any stage ROP or for severe ROP in this cohort and, also, that the risk factors for ROP were similar among SGA and AGA very-low-birth-weight preterm babies.", "prediction_text": "The study found no significant difference in the prevalence of retinopathy of prematurity between preterm infants who were small for gestational age and those who were appropriate for gestational age. However, weight gain from birth to the sixth week of life and need for blood transfusions were identified as significant risk factors for ROP in both groups."}
{"answers": "Frequent consumption of hamburgers showed a dose-dependent association with asthma symptoms, and frequent takeaway consumption showed a similar association with BHR.", "prediction_text": "The study found an independent association between hamburger consumption, particularly 1+ times a week, and the prevalence of wheeze in children, suggesting a potential risk factor for asthma. However, the association with takeaway food and exercise-induced bronchial hyperresponsiveness was not statistically significant."}
{"answers": "In patients with limb-threatening ischemia and lack of venous material for a straightforward venous femorocrural bypass, semi-closed endarterectomy of the superficial femoral artery combined with a short popliteo-crural bypass provides a good alternative.", "prediction_text": "The study reports a cumulative primary patency of 48.4% at 3 years and a limb salvage rate of 68.6% at 1 and 3 years for semi-closed endarterectomy of the superficial femoral artery with a short venous bypass in patients with critical leg ischemia and insufficient venous material. These results suggest that this procedure may be an acceptable alternative for limb-threatening ischemia, but long-term success is limited."}
{"answers": "Although the SLBM is quite repeatable, it underestimates mesopic pupil size and shows a too wide range of agreement with CIP. SLBM shows low sensitivity in detecting pupils larger than 6\u00a0mm, which may be misleading when planning anterior segment surgery. Previous grading-consensus training strategies may increase interrater reproducibility, and compensation for the systematic underestimation could improve accuracy of the SLBM.", "prediction_text": "The study compares the accuracy and reproducibility of measuring pupil diameter using cobalt blue light slit-lamp biomicroscopy (SLBM) and Colvard infrared pupillometry (CIP) in healthy eyes. The mean pupil diameter was smaller with SLBM than CIP, but both methods had good intra- and inter-observer reproducibility. SLBM had lower sensitivity (55.56%-73.68%) and higher specificity (76.19%-95.45%) for detecting pupils larger than 6.0 mm compared to CIP. The best trade-off between sensitivity and specificity r"}
{"answers": "Although there are different patterns of atrophy across the different FTLD-TDP types, it appears that genetic and pathologic factors may also affect the patterns of atrophy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, this study identified distinct patterns of brain atrophy in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) associated with different TDP-43 types. Type 1 showed frontotemporal and parietal atrophy, type 2 predominantly anterior temporal lobe atrophy, and type 3 predominantly posterior frontal atrophy. Additionally, within type 1, those with a progranulin mutation had more lateral temporal lobe atrophy. Subjects with FTLD with motor neuron degeneration had a similar pattern of atrophy regardless of TDP-43 type."}
{"answers": "A set of educational interventions designed for cancer patients significantly improved their satisfaction with information on clinical research, but did not improve clinical trial enrollment of these participants as of 1 year after the study.", "prediction_text": "The study found that increased patient awareness through educational interventions led to higher satisfaction with information about clinical trials, but it did not result in a significant increase in accruals to the trials."}
{"answers": "There was little evidence that people at high risk of falls received systematic falls risk assessment during rehabilitation. When a risk was identified, generally a strategy was implemented. However, failure to assess some risk factors might have limited fall prevention strategies offered. Failure to adequately address risks during hospitalization could contribute to falls post-discharge. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2016; 16: 570-576.", "prediction_text": "The study found that only nine out of 50 patients at high falls risk had falls risk identified in discharge documentation. These patients had a median of 8.0 (interquartile range 6-10) of 17 risk factors, but there was limited evidence of assessment for osteoporosis, footwear, and visual assessment in the previous 2 years. Patients received a median of 6.5 (interquartile range 5-9) out of 16 possible fall prevention strategies, with common strategies being mobility, strength, and Personal Activity of Daily Living training. For 12 risk factors, if the factor was present, there was evidence of a strategy in more than"}
{"answers": "Although most Medicare beneficiaries who received a new CIED between 2005 and 2009 did not have an initial in-person CIED follow-up visit within 2 to 12 weeks after device implantation, the rate of initial follow-up improved appreciably over time. This CIED follow-up visit was significantly more common in white patients than in patients of other races.", "prediction_text": "The study found that while the rate of in-person follow-up visits within 2 to 12 weeks after implantation of cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) improved from 40.3% in 2005 to 55.1% in 2009, only 42.4% of eligible patients had such a visit within this time frame. The rate of follow-up within 1 year was 78.0%. However, there was a significant disparity in follow-up rates between white and other racial groups, with white patients having the highest rate of follow-up within 2 to 12 weeks. The study suggests that experts"}
{"answers": "According to our study, there is a great variability when different brands and models of scanners are compared directly. Furthermore, the CT scan analysis and HU evaluation appears to gather insufficient information in order to characterize and identify the composition of renal stones.", "prediction_text": "The study highlights significant overlaps in mean CT-attenuation values and large variations between different CT scanner models, making it challenging to consistently identify urinary stone compositions. Only some stone types showed significant differences in mean CT attenuation values between specific models."}
{"answers": "Ophthalmic pathology and basic science research show that SBK and ASA are improvements in excimer laser keratorefractive surgery compared to conventional LASIK or PRK, particularly with regard to maintaining corneal biomechanics and perhaps moderately reducing the risk of corneal haze. However, most of the disadvantages caused by wound healing issues remain.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that PRK and ASA, and secondarily SBK, have different biomechanical properties than conventional LASIK, with stronger and more rigid regions located anteriorly and peripherally in PRK and ASA, and PRK and ASA potentially being safer in terms of risk for causing keratectasia. However, all excimer laser keratorefractive surgical techniques have disadvantages due to inadequate reparative wound healing, and ASA can still develop corneal haze, while SBK has the potential for interface wound complications."}
{"answers": "The Internet would be a practical and accessible way of delivering sexual health education to young people, particularly if it is incorporated into activities and websites they enjoy.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that a significant number of web-savvy young people (62.4%) would use a genitourinary medicine website and express interest in a 'question line' feature for confidential queries, indicating the potential of the Internet as a platform for enhancing sexual health awareness among this age group. However, current use of the Internet for health information is low."}
{"answers": "Ultrasound not only has comparable sensitivity to that of X-ray for the identification of limb fractures but is also equally effective for the diagnosis of fracture type and dislocation. Thus, ultrasound can be used as an adequate alternative method to X-ray for pediatric fracture diagnosis.", "prediction_text": "The study found that while X-ray was slightly more accurate than ultrasound in identifying fracture type, ultrasound was slightly more accurate in identifying dislocations. However, these differences were not statistically significant after adjustment for multiple testing. Therefore, the study does not provide strong evidence to conclude that ultrasound is equal to X-ray in pediatric fracture diagnosis."}
{"answers": "Although initial infection control rate was substantially lower in the retention group than the removal group, final results were comparable at latest followup. We believe retention treatment can be selectively considered for non-S. aureus infection, and when applied in selected patients, polyethylene exchange should be performed.", "prediction_text": "The study found that infection control rates were lower with implant retention (31% vs. 59% after initial treatment, 81% vs. 91% at latest follow-up). However, treatment duration was shorter in the retention group and there was no difference in additional surgeries or length of hospital stay. The study identified Staphylococcus aureus infection and polyethylene nonexchange as risk factors for failure of infection control in the retention group. Based on this data, it is unclear if implant retention can be recommended for all cases of infected TKA due to the higher risk of infection recurrence."}
{"answers": "The observed socioeconomic, demographic and microbiological differences between unmarried and married women could be responsible for the poor pregnancy outcome among unmarried pregnant women in Poland. Unmarried pregnant women should be covered by comprehensive medical care even before pregnancy. Further studies taking into account the role of psychological stress, patterns of sexual behavior and substance abuse during pregnancy could help identify the factors responsible for adverse pregnancy outcome among unmarried pregnant women.", "prediction_text": "The study found that unmarried pregnant women in Poland had a higher risk of Mycoplasma hominis infection, which is a significant microbiological factor associated with poor pregnancy outcome. However, the study also noted that unmarried status was a borderline risk factor for bacterial vaginosis after adjusting for age, smoking, and education. Overall, the findings suggest that both socioeconomic and microbiological factors may contribute to poor pregnancy outcomes among unmarried pregnant women in Poland."}
{"answers": "In conclusion, concept mapping has a positive effect on students' academic achievement. These findings could provide valuable evidence for establishing concept mapping as a continuous teaching strategy for nursing students.", "prediction_text": "Yes, based on this study, concept mapping significantly enhanced the learning outcomes of nursing students as indicated by higher mean scores on cumulative tests compared to the traditional quiz method. Additionally, there was a gradual improvement in the developed maps during the intervention period."}
{"answers": "In this nationally representative population-based survey, HCMV seropositivity is associated with hypertension in women in the NHANES population. This association is largely explained by the association of hypertension with age and the increase in past exposure to HCMV with age.", "prediction_text": "The study found that among US adults aged 16-49 years in NHANES 1999-2002, HCMV infection was significantly associated with hypertension in women before adjusting for confounders, but the association was attenuated after adjusting for age, and no significant association was found in men."}
{"answers": "Although the cost-effectiveness of a single-pill strategy was within the acceptable willingness-to-pay threshold, the QALY difference were minimal. Further research is recommended to explore the long-term impact of the strategy.", "prediction_text": "The study found that using coformulated fixed dose antiretroviral formulations did not significantly improve quality of life (as measured by SF-6D scores) compared to multiple free dose combinations in HIV/AIDS patients, but it was more costly and had a higher probability of being cost-effective above a $40,000 threshold per quality-adjusted life year gained."}
{"answers": "2ME is able to enhance the antiproliferative activity of certain chemotherapeutics at pharmacological relevant concentrations. This estradiol metabolite is currently in a phase II trial in patients with refractary metastatic breast cancer and the tolerability has been shown to be very good. The combination of 2ME with chemotherapeutics may therefore offer a new clinically relevant treatment regimen for hormone-dependent cancer.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the combination of 2-methoxyestradiol with epirubicin and carboplatin results in an additive inhibitory effect on human ovarian cancer cell proliferation, indicating the potential for reduced chemotherapeutic dosages when used in combination."}
{"answers": "Follow-up after endometrial cancer treatment varies in Italy. In this retrospective study, women with asymptomatic recurrence have shown a better clinical outcome compared with those with symptomatic relapse. The optimal approach is actually unknown, and guidelines comparing follow-up protocols have not been established. Prospective cost-effectiveness studies are needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, imaging modalities are more likely than clinical visits or cytologic examinations to lead to the diagnosis of asymptomatic endometrial cancer relapses. However, the presence of symptoms at recurrence is associated with poorer survival outcomes."}
{"answers": "Lower Infundibular height could be a good measurement tool for deciding which patients with lower calyceal lithiasis would benefit from SWL treatment. Height of less than 22 mm suggests a good outcome from lithotripsy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a greater infundibular height was associated with a lower likelihood of stone clearance after extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy for lower pole calyceal stones (p = 0.002)."}
{"answers": "The interval from the onset of clinical symptoms to the initial surgical intervention seems to be the most important prognostic factor with a significant impact on outcome. Despite extensive therapeutic efforts, Fournier's gangrene remains a surgical emergency and early recognition with prompt radical debridement is the mainstays of management.", "prediction_text": "Yes, Fournier's gangrene is still associated with a significant mortality rate, as evidenced by a mean age higher in deceased patients and a significant difference in leukocyte count between survivors and deceased patients in this study."}
{"answers": "These four cases may belong to a variant form of HAM/TSP, predominantly involving the cervical cord levels.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that two out of the four patients with chronic progressive cervical myelopathy and HTLV-I infection had high risk factors for developing HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), based on virologic and immunologic aspects. The presence of inflammatory changes in one patient's spinal cord biopsy and demyelinating sensorimotor polyneuropathy in another patient further supports the possibility of a variant form of HAM/TSP."}
{"answers": "The results of the current study demonstrated that there are factors that increase the risk of a leakage which would enable surgeons to define risk groups, to more carefully select patients, and to offer a closer follow-up during the postoperative course with early recognition and adequate treatment. All future efforts should be focused on a further reduction of serious complications to make the LSG a widely accepted and safer procedure.", "prediction_text": "The study identified male gender, higher BMI, concomitant sleep apnea, conversion to laparotomy, longer operation time, use of both buttresses and oversewing, and intraoperative complications as risk factors for increased staple line leakage in patients undergoing primary sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity. However, only longer operation time and year of procedure were significant on multivariate analysis."}
{"answers": "Font influenced pregnant women's ratings of intervention complexity.", "prediction_text": "The title and font of participant information sheets can influence pregnant women's perceptions of an antenatal intervention, with the Double Awkward condition being perceived as more complex compared to other conditions. However, the paper does not directly address the impact on recruitment and participation. Further research is needed to determine if these effects translate into differences in recruitment and participation rates."}
{"answers": "Results of this survey highlight the wide variety of practice patterns in the US for handling surgical margins in breast-conservation treatment. This issue remains controversial, with no prevailing standard of care. Consequently, additional study is needed in the modern era of multimodality treatment to examine the minimal amount of surgical treatment necessary, in conjunction with chemotherapy and radiation, to attain adequate local control rates in breast-conservation treatment.", "prediction_text": "There is no consensus among breast surgeons regarding the optimal methods for attaining negative surgical margins in breast-conservation treatments for breast cancer, with significant variability in clinical practices and acceptable margin sizes."}
{"answers": "The findings showed that acupuncture of voice-related acupoints could bring about improvement in vocal function and healing of vocal fold lesions.", "prediction_text": "Yes, based on this study, both genuine and sham acupuncture showed improvement in vocal function and perceived quality of life for individuals with phonotraumatic vocal pathologies. However, only genuine acupuncture resulted in structural improvements, specifically a reduction in the size of vocal fold lesions."}
{"answers": "A policy of early cesarean delivery in eclampsia, carrying \u226534 weeks, is not associated with better outcomes.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find a statistically significant difference in maternal or perinatal outcomes between cesarean and vaginal delivery in women with eclampsia. The neonatal event rate was lower in cesarean delivery but the difference was not significant."}
{"answers": "Based on data derived from self-reported health conditions, and not withstanding the limitations of such a study, we conclude that there is good evidence to suggest that individuals with moderate to severe periodontal disease are at higher risk of suffering from rheumatoid arthritis and vice versa.", "prediction_text": "The study found a significantly higher prevalence of self-reported rheumatoid arthritis in individuals referred for periodontal treatment (3.95%) compared to those attending for routine dentistry (0.66%), and this was consistent with the published higher prevalence in periodontal patients. Additionally, 62.5% of referred patients with rheumatoid arthritis had advanced forms of periodontal disease. These findings suggest a relationship between rheumatoid arthritis and periodontal disease."}
{"answers": "Present audit shows that the process of implementation of labor analgesia was quick, successful and safe, notwithstanding the identification of one cluster of women with suboptimal response to epidural analgesia that need to be further studies, overall pregnant womens'adhesion to labor analgesia was satisfactory.", "prediction_text": "The study shows that the use of epidural analgesia for labor increased significantly and was associated with high patient and caregiver satisfaction. The effectiveness of analgesia, as indicated by a significant decrease in Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores, was observed in both clusters. Therefore, the standard of effective analgesia appears to be reachable for most women."}
{"answers": "The residency training sites of the Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine provide patient care opportunities similar to those found in a national survey of family and general practitioners.", "prediction_text": "The study finds similarities in patient characteristics, reasons for visits, diagnoses, and hospitalization rates between family practice at residency teaching sites and community practice as represented by NAMCS data. However, preventive and therapeutic services are more common in residency sites, while diagnostic services and consultations are less frequent. The mean visit duration is similar."}
{"answers": "Our findings suggest that, in HT+ postmenopausal women, the rs2813544 polymorphism may influence LDL-C levels and, as previously described, ESR2 rs1256049 is associated with T-chol and LDL-C. No previous study has investigated the association of this SNP set with lipoprotein levels in women while taking into account the hormonal status of the patients.", "prediction_text": "The ESR1 rs2813544 polymorphism and one ESR2 gene haplotype are associated with LDL-C levels in postmenopausal women using hormone therapy."}
{"answers": "The prevalence of PAD is high in nursing home residents. AAI is not predictive for IHD mortality in this population. In very frail elderly traditional risk factors and PAD are less important predictors of death compared to poor functional status, nutritional factors and previous cardiovascular disease.", "prediction_text": "The study found no relationship between ankle/arm pressure and cardiovascular mortality in older patients living in nursing homes. However, low hemoglobin values, previous cerebrovascular disease, polypharmacy, and poor mobility conditions were independently associated with increased risk of ischemic heart disease mortality."}
{"answers": "The data demonstrate that vaccination has a relatively weak and short-lasting effect in old age. The results of the study should stimulate discussions about strategies how vaccinations can be made more effective in old age. Improved campaigns, shortened vaccination intervals as well as the design of novel vaccines tailored to fulfill the specific demands of the aging immune system are imaginable.", "prediction_text": "The study found that many elderly Austrians (>60 years) have insufficient protection against infectious diseases despite some being vaccinated regularly. This is due to both under-vaccination and low antibody concentrations with short durations of protective immunity."}
{"answers": "The introduction of a discharge coordinator improved the quality of discharge planning, but at additional cost.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that the presence of a dedicated discharge coordinator led to improved discharge planning, reduced problems experienced by patients after discharge, and increased patient satisfaction with the discharge process. However, there was no evidence of improved timeliness or effectiveness of community services, or improved appropriateness or efficiency of bed use."}
{"answers": "Local anesthesia is not required to lower a patient's pain intensity when applying intra-articular contrast media for MR arthrography of the shoulder. This could result in reduced costs and a reduced risk of adverse reactions, without an impact on patient comfort.", "prediction_text": "According to this study, there was no statistically significant difference in pain intensity between patients who received local anesthesia and those who did not before intraarticular contrast medium injection for MR arthrography of the shoulder (p=.960)."}
{"answers": "A routinely inserted ENBD tube did not improve the clinical course, despite patients having to endure increased procedure time and discomfort, and the insertion would therefore be unnecessary.", "prediction_text": "Based on this study, there is no significant difference in the recurrence rate of cholangitis or length of hospital stay between patients with choledocholithiasis-induced cholangitis who underwent endoscopic clearance of common bile duct stones with or without the insertion of an endoscopic nasobiliary drainage tube. However, the procedure time was longer and discomfort score was higher in the ENBD group. Therefore, the routine use of ENBD tubes after endoscopic clearance of common bile duct stones in patients with choledocholithiasis-induced cholangitis does not seem to improve clinical outcomes."}
{"answers": "Regarding the pedigree, we discuss different modes of inheritance. The presence of consanguineous unions in this family suggests the possibility of a common ancestor and thus a recessive autosomal mode of inheritance.", "prediction_text": "This study suggests a higher than average prevalence (19.7%) of nasal polyposis within the family studied, compared to the national prevalence (2.1%), indicating a potential hereditary factor. However, further research is needed to confirm this finding."}
{"answers": "Emergency DBE is feasible, safe and effective in acute OGIB and may avoid major surgery, diagnosing and successfully treating most patients. Combined approach with RT viewing by CE is especially useful to identify recurrent bleeding vascular lesions such as DL that may be easily misdiagnosed by non-emergency DBE.", "prediction_text": "This retrospective study evaluated the feasibility of emergency double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) and capsule endoscopy (CE) with real-time viewing in managing acute overt-obscure gastrointestinal bleeding. Of 27 patients, 16 underwent both procedures, leading to a higher detection rate of Dieulafoy's lesions in the emergency DBE group (40.7% vs 0.9%, P\u2009<\u20090.001). CE with real-time viewing modified DBE management in 25% of cases. Overall, the combined approach was feasible for acute overt-obscure"}
{"answers": "Laparoscopic antireflux surgery significantly improved quality of life in reflux patients whose symptoms were well controlled on medical therapy. Although on the basis of a noncomparative trial with a relatively short follow-up period, we believe such patients should be considered for laparoscopic antireflux surgery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, according to this retrospective study, laparoscopic antireflux surgery led to significant improvements in physical and mental composite scores on the Short Form 36 questionnaire, total scores on the Psychological General Well-Being index, and gastrointestinal symptom scores, including reflux symptoms, on the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale in patients with well-controlled gastro-oesophageal reflux disease."}
{"answers": "Patients in regional and rural settings were willing partners in developing skills of junior medical students, who had greater involvement in patient consultations than previously reported for urban students. Our study extends the findings from urban general practice that patients are underutilised partners in community-based medical training. The support of patients from regional and rural settings could facilitate the expansion of primary care-based medical education in these areas of workforce need.", "prediction_text": "Yes, based on this study, patients in regional and rural Australia are generally willing participants in community-based medical education, expressing positive views and increased acceptance of medical student involvement in consultations."}
{"answers": "Overall, in a US Air Force population, OSA does not predict a decrease in aerobic fitness as measured by cycle ergometry. However, patients with an apnea-hypopnea index of greater than 20 have a statistically significant decrease in aerobic fitness compared to the normal population. This study demonstrates the effects of OSA on aerobic fitness. Further correlation of fitness testing results with OSA severity and treatment is needed.", "prediction_text": "Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with increased aerobic fitness on average, but those with severe apnea-hypopnea index (>20) show decreased aerobic fitness compared to normal population. No improvement in aerobic fitness was observed after medical or surgical treatment for OSA."}
{"answers": "Pictorial HWLs with didactic textual forms seem to work better than those with testimonial narratives. Future research should determine which pictorial HWL content has the greatest real-world impact among consumers from disadvantaged groups, including assessment of how HWL content should change to maintain its impact as tobacco control environments strengthen and consumer awareness of smoking-related risks increases.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that didactic pictorial warning labels with images of diseased organs may be more effective in addressing smoking-related health disparities among adults with higher educational attainment, as they had higher credibility, relevance, and impact compared to testimonial labels or human suffering images. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and explore their implications for health disparities."}
{"answers": "Preferential transmission of AVPR1A to hypersexual or uninhibited people-seeking probands was not supported.", "prediction_text": "The research paper did not find a significant association between arginine vasopressin V1a receptor microsatellites, including GATA and complex repeats, and hypersexuality in children with a prepubertal and early adolescent bipolar disorder phenotype, based on case-control and family-based association methods."}
{"answers": "We suggest that regardless of family history, all children over 5 years should be screened for hyperlipidemia. Education about hyperlipidemia and precautions for its complications should be given to both children and families. The best and easiest way to reach children is to screen them at schools. School is also a good place for education of children about hyperlipidemia and risk factors.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find a significant relationship between family history of hyperlipidemia and elevated cholesterol or LDL-cholesterol levels in school children. Therefore, family history may not be a reliable indicator for cholesterol screening in this population."}
{"answers": "These data indicate digoxin use may be associated with a reduction in risk of PCa. Given the potential mechanisms by which digoxin may exert an anti-neoplastic effect and other recent studies showing a negative association between digoxin use and PCa, further research is warranted.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that digoxin use for cardiovascular disease may be associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer, particularly in individuals with frequent PSA tests. (OR 0.44, 95% CI: 0.20-0.98 for those with multiple PSA tests.) However, the findings are not definitive due to the wide confidence interval in the multivariate analysis (OR 0.58, 95% CI: 0.30-1.10 for all cases). Further research is needed to confirm these results."}
{"answers": "GHD men receiving GH treatment have a mortality rate not different from the background population. In women, after exclusion of high-risk patients, mortality was not different from the background population except for CVD. Mortality due to malignancies was not elevated in adults receiving GH treatment. Next to gender, the heterogeneous etiology is of influence on mortality in GHD adults with GH treatment.", "prediction_text": "The study did not provide conclusive evidence that growth hormone replacement therapy reduces mortality in adults with growth hormone deficiency, as the standardized mortality ratio in the treatment group remained higher than the expected mortality rate. However, the study did identify sex, GHD onset, age, and underlying diagnosis as influencing factors on mortality in this population."}
{"answers": "It seems quite admissible and justified to encourage medical students to officiate as examiners in undergraduate emergency medicine OSCE formative testing, but not necessarily in summative assessment evaluations.", "prediction_text": "The study found that students achieved higher scores in certain OSCE stations and overall in the OSCE with student examiners, while students gave higher ratings for the ACS station and overall OSCE evaluation in the faculty examiner track. Effect sizes were mostly small. These findings suggest that student examiners can be reasonable substitutes for faculty in an undergraduate OSCE on medical emergencies, but there may be some differences in performance and evaluation."}
{"answers": "Expression of ER is a constitutional feature of the connective tissue and smooth muscle cells of the anal continence organ. Estrogen receptors and PR are not detectable in the striated muscle fibers of the external anal sphincter in either sex. The presence of ER in the stroma and smooth muscles of the anal canal suggests that these tissues are targets for estrogen. This constitutes a theoretical basis for the beneficial effects of estrogen and progestin replacement on anal continence in postmenopausal women.", "prediction_text": "The study identified the presence of estrogen and progesterone receptors in the anal canal's smooth muscle cells of the internal sphincter and perimuscular connective tissue in both females and males. The findings suggest a potential hormonal influence on anal continence in women, as ER and PR were more prevalent in female tissues. However, further research is needed to determine the exact role of these hormones in anal incontinence."}
{"answers": "In women with bothersome MUI, concomitant AA repair does not result in additional improvement in OAB symptoms over MUS alone. Patients with postoperative complications exhibit less improvement in OAB symptoms.", "prediction_text": "The study found no significant difference in the improvement of overactive bladder symptoms between women undergoing midurethral sling alone and those undergoing concomitant midurethral sling and anterior/apical repair."}
{"answers": "An association was found between sublingual varices and hypertension. Examining the lateral borders of the tongue is easily done, causes no harm and could be a valuable method for the dental profession to take active part in preventive healthcare.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found an association between the presence of sublingual varices and hypertension (OR = 2.25, p<0.002). Patients with sublingual varices had significantly higher mean systolic (132 mmHg vs. 123 mmHg, p<0.0001) and diastolic (83 mmHg vs. 80 mmHg, p<0.005) blood pressures compared to those without varices."}
{"answers": "Our data suggested that visually impaired pedestrians can make accurate and reliable street crossing decisions like those of normally sighted pedestrians. When using auditory information only, all subjects significantly overestimated the vehicular gap time. Our finding that blind pedestrians performed significantly worse than either the normally sighted or visually impaired subjects under the hearing only condition suggested that they may benefit from training to improve their detection ability and/or interpretation of vehicular gap times.", "prediction_text": "Normally sighted and visually impaired pedestrians are accurate and reliable in their street crossing decisions using both visual and auditory information or just visual information. However, all subjects, including the blind, are reliable but inaccurate when using only auditory information for decision-making. Blind subjects are less accurate than normally sighted and visually impaired pedestrians when using only auditory information."}
{"answers": "Initial single scrotal incision can be recommended for orchidopexy, even in the more difficult cases of impalpable undescended testes. Advantages seem to include shorter operative time, a cosmetically appealing single incision, and possibly less pain. The scrotal incision technique significantly reduces the need for laparoscopy in impalpable testes. Surprisingly, it even allows successful orchidopexy of abdominal testes, provided an open processus is present.", "prediction_text": "Based on the study, a scrotal approach to both palpable and impalpable undescended testes resulted in successful diagnosis and treatment in 78% of cases, with a limited number of complications. Therefore, it may be considered as a first-choice approach."}
{"answers": "Center differences in enteral feeding advancement occur and may have a significant impact on short-term outcomes such as nosocomial sepsis. Large, multicenter, prospective trials are required to further elucidate the optimal feeding strategy for VLBW infants.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that infants in centers with slower enteral feeding advancement had a higher rate of sepsis, more central venous lines, and more antibiotic use compared to infants in centers with rapid enteral feeding advancement."}
{"answers": "There appears to be no difference in the numbers of emboli detected when the first vascular clamp is applied to the proximal aorta or iliacs.", "prediction_text": "The sequence of clamp application during open abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery did not significantly influence distal embolisation based on the number of emboli detected with Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (p=0.49). However, current smoking was associated with a higher number of emboli (p=0.034)."}
{"answers": "GP hospitals seem to reduce the utilisation of general hospitals with respect to admissions as well as occupied bed days.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that populations with access to general practitioner hospitals had significantly lower rates of admissions and occupied bed days in general hospitals compared to those without such access. The differences were particularly notable for patients with respiratory diseases, cardiac failure, cancer, stroke, and fractures."}
{"answers": "The EBP unit was associated with better patient outcomes and more efficient performance than achieved by the same physicians previously or by SP concurrently.", "prediction_text": "The study found that patients treated by the Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) unit had significantly lower mortality rates (6.27% vs. 7.75%, P\ufffd<0.001) and shorter lengths of stay (6.01 vs. 8.46 days, P\ufffd<0.001) compared to those treated by standard practice (SP) doctors, despite EBP doctors attending twice as many patients. No statistically significant differences were detected in outcomes or activity between the two groups prior to the reorganization."}
{"answers": "Although travel burden is associated with timely diagnosis and treatment for some types of cancer, we did not find evidence that driving time was, in general, better at predicting timeliness of cancer diagnosis and treatment than driving distance. More intensive efforts at early detection of breast cancer and early treatment of CRC for Medicaid patients who live in remote areas may be needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, longer driving distances and hours for Medicaid patients with breast, colorectal, or lung cancer are associated with later stages at diagnosis for breast cancer and longer time-to-treatment for colorectal cancer."}
{"answers": "Our results indicate that training managers in transformational leadership behaviours may have a positive impact on healthcare workers' health over time. However, more research is needed to examine the mechanisms by which transformational leadership brings about improved sleep quality; self-efficacy was not found to be the explanation.", "prediction_text": "The research paper found no evidence that self-efficacy mediates the relationship between transformational leadership and healthcare workers' sleep quality."}
{"answers": "The use of US helps in making a correct diagnosis and in the follow-up with objective criteria and also convinces the patient and the family that the treatment needs to be continued.", "prediction_text": "Yes, ultrasound is a reliable and objective method for diagnosing constipation in children, as shown by consistent results between radiologists and a significant correlation with constipation symptoms and fecal load. Ultrasound can also monitor response to treatment. The cutoff point for rectal diameter to diagnose constipation is 2.44 cm, and constipated children have thicker rectal anterior walls and higher fecal loads. However, normalization of rectal diameter may not be achieved after treatment within a month."}
{"answers": "Brachytherapy with ruthenium applicators is an effective therapy for small- and medium-size posterior uveal melanomas. Our results are comparable to other series. The treatment outcome does not seem to be capable of improvement by increasing the apical dose. An internationally accepted model for defining the dosage in brachytherapy is needed.", "prediction_text": "The research paper does not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that escalating the apical dose of beta-radiation from 100 Gy to 160 Gy with 106Ru plaques significantly changes the treatment outcome for posterior choroidal melanomas. The study reports similar 5-year survival rates, local control, and vision preservation with a median apical dose of 120 Gy and median scleral dose of 546 Gy. The main side effects were retinopathy and macular degeneration or scarring."}
{"answers": "The addition of epinephrine to ACLS-SAPO increases vital organ perfusion pressures and improves outcome from cardiac arrest. There appears to be a profound loss of arterial vasomotor tone after prolonged arrest. This loss of vasomotor tone may make exogenous pressors necessary for resuscitation after prolonged cardiac arrest.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that epinephrine, as a pressor, may enhance the effectiveness of aortic perfusion and oxygenation therapy during cardiac arrest, as indicated by higher aortic and coronary perfusion pressures and a greater number of animals achieving return of spontaneous circulation."}
{"answers": "In a leading specialty journal, cited reviewers gave higher scores than noncited reviewers. However, this\u00a0was likely due to their being assigned higher-quality manuscripts and not because they were cited in the manuscript. Reviewer requests that their work be cited were rare.", "prediction_text": "The study found that manuscripts with citations to the reviewer's work received slightly higher overall desirability scores compared to those without such citations (mean score difference 0.3, 95% CI 0 to 0.6). However, after adjusting for manuscript quality, the effect was not statistically significant (OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.8 to 2.2). Reviewers suggested adding citations to their work in 3% of cases and to others' work in 10% of cases."}
{"answers": "Preoperative education delivered by nurses reduced anxiety and postoperative complications of patients undergoing cardiac surgery, but it was not effective in reducing readmissions or length of stay.", "prediction_text": "Yes, nurse-led preoperative education significantly reduces anxiety in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, as indicated by a greater decrease in state anxiety scores both before surgery and during follow-up. Additionally, a lower incidence of chest infections was observed in the intervention group. However, no significant difference was found in length of stay or readmission rates."}
{"answers": "Improving hospital efficiency by shortening length of stay does not appear to result in increased rates of readmission or numbers of physician visits within 30 days after discharge from hospital. Research is needed to identify optimal lengths of stay and expected readmission rates.", "prediction_text": "The study found that decreasing lengths of stay over time for patients with acute myocardial infarction, bronchitis or asthma, transurethral prostatectomy, and uterine or adnexal procedures did not significantly affect readmission rates or mean number of physician visits within 30 days after discharge, except for a significant increase in readmission rates for uterine or adnexal procedures in the first and second year. No correlation was found between length of stay and readmission rates or mean number of physician visits for individual hospitals in the studied categories. Therefore, discharging patients earlier from Winnipeg hospitals does not adversely affect quality of care based on these findings."}
{"answers": "Solitary kidney in a canine model is more resistant to ischemia than paired kidneys based on radiological, pathological and genetic evidence.", "prediction_text": "Based on this study, the data does not support the notion that a solitary kidney is more resistant to warm ischemia than paired kidneys. In fact, the study suggests that the paired kidney experiences more severe damage and slower recovery. However, the study also indicates that the expression of proinflammatory markers is higher and more sustained in the paired kidney."}
{"answers": "Elective re-siting of intravenous cannulae every 48 hours results in a significant reduction in the incidence and severity of PVT. We recommend that this should be adopted as standard practice in managing all patients who require prolonged intravenous therapy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, elective re-siting of intravenous cannulas every 48 hours decreases the incidence and severity of peripheral thrombophlebitis, with a significant reduction in the number of cases in the study group compared to the control group (p<0.0001). The majority of PVT episodes occurred on day 3 in the control group."}
{"answers": "We conclude that 3-phase bone scintigraphy prior to surgery could be a useful method to determine the amputation level in a diabetic foot. We conclude that further, comparative, more comprehensive, long-term, and controlled studies are required.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that 3-phase bone scintigraphy can be used to determine amputation levels in diabetic foot, with varying amputation levels including finger, ray, transmetatarsal, Lisfranc, Chopart, Syme, below-the-knee, above-the-knee, knee disarticulation, and other levels. The method was associated with no mortality during the study, but reamputation was required in seven patients. However, the study does not provide enough evidence to establish scintigraphy as a definitive guideline method in determining amputation levels in diabetic foot. Further research is needed to confirm its accuracy and effectiveness in"}
{"answers": "At baseline assessment patients of lower socioeconomic status showed lower health related quality of life. Since there was no clear trend at follow-up assessment this suggests that patients from different socioeconomic status responded to treatment similarly. In general, the findings suggest that quality of life is not only the outcome of the disease and its treatment, but is also highly dependent on each patients' socioeconomic characteristics.", "prediction_text": "At baseline, lung cancer patients of lower socioeconomic status had significantly worse quality of life in terms of physical mobility, energy, role functioning, physical functioning, and breathlessness compared to affluent patients. However, no significant differences were observed between the two groups at the three-month follow-up assessment."}
{"answers": "General surgery research residents' intraoperative leadership skills showed significant correlations to their perceptions of skill decay and task difficulty during a bowel repair. Evaluating resident's directional instructions may provide an additional individualized intraoperative assessment metric. Further evaluation relating to operative performance outcomes is warranted.", "prediction_text": "The study found that residents who rated lower in self-efficacy for intraoperative decision-making and small bowel repair skills tended to give more instructions to their assistants during a simulated surgery, and this correlation was also associated with lower perceived difficulty in completing the task. However, the study did not directly assess the relationship between leadership skills and technical skill ratings."}
{"answers": "The severity of TAI is influenced by the sharpness of the aortic arch. There is an inverse relationship between the severity of aortic injury and the aortic arch index.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the anatomy of the aortic arch, specifically the aortic arch angle, is significantly associated with the severity of traumatic aortic injury, with type III injuries having a larger aortic arch angle compared to type I and IV injuries."}
{"answers": "Clinical variables, either isolated or as components of a model, could not identify all children with pathologic radiographs.", "prediction_text": "The study found that among children with a first episode of wheezing, only pretreatment oxygen saturation significantly differed between those with and without pathologic radiographs. However, clinical score, respiratory rate, and presence of rales did not differ significantly between groups. The discriminant analysis correctly predicted only 15% of pathologic radiographs, suggesting that clinical variables have limited ability to predict pathologic radiographs during the initial episode of wheezing."}
{"answers": "The results showed no overall first night effect on severity of RMMA frequency in young and healthy patients with SB. In clinical practice, one-night sleep recording may be sufficient for moderate-high frequency SB patients. However, low RMMA frequency in the first night could be confirmed by a second night based on the patient's medical and dental history.", "prediction_text": "The study found no overall first night effect on sleep parameters, but sleep bruxism (RMMA) showed higher burst index, bruxism time index, and mean burst duration on the second night. Five patients in the low frequency group had increased RMMA severity on the second night."}
{"answers": "Athletes engaged in competitive sports are more likely to develop ventricular arrhythmias during exercise. These arrhythmias subside over time when athletes are engaged in non-competitive sports.", "prediction_text": "The study found that athletes with ventricular arrhythmias during an initial exercise test had fewer arrhythmias during a follow-up test, suggesting that these arrhythmias may subside over time.

{"answers": "A well developed collateral circulation does not predict an increased risk of restenosis after PCI.", "prediction_text": "The research paper did not find a correlation between a well-developed collateral circulation and an increased risk of restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The study included 58 patients with elective single vessel PCI, and collateral flow was assessed using a collateral flow index (CFI). Restenosis rates were similar in patients with poor and good collaterals, and CFI was not correlated with the degree of restenosis. Other factors, such as stent diameter, stent length, residual stenosis, and smoking history, were identified as predictors of restenosis."}
{"answers": "We conclude that patient and graft survival on transplanting kidneys from elderly donors to young recipients is superimposable on that obtained with young donors. However, renal function is better in the group of young donors.", "prediction_text": "The study found no significant differences in patient or graft survival between young recipients with kidneys from elderly donors and those with kidneys from younger donors after 1, 5, and 10 years. However, creatinine levels were significantly higher in the elderly donor group at 1, 5, and 10 years post-transplant."}
{"answers": "Many patients do not understand their ED care or their discharge instructions. Moreover, most patients appear to be unaware of their lack of understanding and report inappropriate confidence in their comprehension and recall.", "prediction_text": "No, many patients with deficiencies in their comprehension of emergency department care and instructions were not aware of these deficiencies."}
{"answers": "The results of this study suggest that normothermic CPB does not prevent the development of the \"euthyroid sick syndrome\" during and after CPB. Despite these changes in thyroid function, most patients in both groups had a normal postoperative recovery.", "prediction_text": "The study found that both hypothermic and normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass resulted in reduced levels of total thyroxine, total triiodothyronine, and free T3 in the postoperative period, as well as elevated mean serum reverse T3 levels on postoperative days 1 and 3. These changes suggest a development of subclinical hypothyroidism or euthyroid sick syndrome in all patients, regardless of CPB temperature. Therefore, the conclusion of the study does not support the notion that CPB temperature has no effect on postoperative euthyroid sick syndrome."}
{"answers": "Severe hypoglycaemia is associated with an increased risk for CV outcomes in people at high CV risk and dysglycaemia. Although allocation to insulin glargine vs. standard care was associated with an increased risk of severe and non-severe hypoglycaemia, the relative risk of CV outcomes with hypoglycaemia was lower with insulin glargine-based glucose-lowering therapy than with the standard glycaemic control. Trial Registration (ORIGIN ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00069784).", "prediction_text": "Severe hypoglycaemia, but not non-severe hypoglycaemia, is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, mortality, CV death, and arrhythmic death. The risk is higher with standard care than with insulin glargine."}
{"answers": "EDWS is a safe and effective treatment for esophagogastric varices secondary to portal hypertension in selected patients. Patients treated with EDWS had a lower complication rate of portal venous system thrombosis compared with those treated with conventional MED.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that esophagogastric devascularization without splenectomy (EDWS) in portal hypertension is associated with a lower morbidity rate of portal venous system thrombosis compared to modified esophagogastric devascularization with splenectomy (MED). Additionally, the 1- and 3-year recurrence rates of esophagogastric variceal hemorrhage were similar in both groups. These findings indicate that EDWS may be a safe and effective alternative to MED for the treatment of portal hypertension."}
{"answers": "Significant postoperative pain can be expected in the following situations: pain after prior surgery, presence of chronic pain sustained for more than six months, intense preoperative pain, state of depression.", "prediction_text": "Yes, based on the research, a prior history of surgical pain, duration and intensity of preoperative pain, and depression can be used to predict the intensity of postoperative pain."}
{"answers": "The general practice selection process is predictive of future performance in the MRCGP.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a statistically significant correlation between general practice selection scores and success in the MRCGP examinations, specifically for the Applied Knowledge Test (r = 0.491, P<0.01) and Clinical Skills Assessment (r = 0.526, P<0.01)."}
{"answers": "Although the association of prostate and lung cancer is uncommon, the possibility of synchronous tumors should be considered in patients with urinary and pulmonary symptoms suggestive of neoplasm. It is important to determine if the lesion is a metastasis, since the prognosis depends on the second tumor.", "prediction_text": "The research paper does not provide sufficient information to determine if prostatic syndrome and pleural effusion are different diseases. The paper only reports an association between the two conditions in advanced stages of both prostate and lung cancer."}
{"answers": "The practice of intensive observation for the first transfusion in pediatric patients is probably unnecessary.", "prediction_text": "Based on the data from this study, only a small percentage (8.7%) of pediatric patients experienced mild transfusion reactions during their first transfusion, none of whom required ICU management. Severe reactions (3.4%) occurred during subsequent transfusions. Therefore, the data suggests that intensive monitoring during the first transfusion may not be necessary for the majority of pediatric patients."}
{"answers": "There is no indication of a rebound aggravation of symptoms 12 to 14 days after a 5-day treatment with lansoprazole 60 mg once daily in patients with reflux symptoms.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that a rebound aggravation of symptoms, as measured by higher symptom scores during a placebo period after short-term treatment with lansoprazole, cannot be ruled out based on the findings of this study. However, the differences in symptom scores were not statistically significant."}
{"answers": "Our long-term study showed significantly better (2-fold) results regarding the continence score for the abdominal approach compared with the transanal pull-through. The stool pattern and enterocolitis scores were somewhat better for the TERPT group. These findings raise an important issue about the current surgical management of HD; however, more cases will need to be studied before a definitive conclusion can be drawn.", "prediction_text": "The study found that while there were no significant differences in overall long-term outcomes between transanal endorectal pull-through (TERPT) and conventional transabdominal pull-through (ABD) for Hirschsprung disease, continence was better in the ABD group and stool pattern was better in the TERPT group. However, age at interview did not significantly affect the long-term scoring outcome between groups."}
{"answers": "The current study revealed an increase in health care services utilization from 2001 to 2009 in the older Spanish population.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the prevalence of health care services use, specifically general practitioner visits, increased significantly among elderly people (women: OR 1.43, 1.27-1.61; men: OR 1.71, 1.49-1.97) during the studied period (2001-2009)."}
{"answers": "It is concluded from the study that this knowledge if applied to dead human subjects, may preserve dead bodies temporarily allowing delayed funeral.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that Raksi, a homemade alcohol, can temporarily preserve dead bodies by arresting postmortem changes for up to 72 hours due to its preservative, bactericidal, and disinfectant properties. However, more severe putrefactive changes were observed after 96 hours."}
{"answers": "The Holmium:YAG laser is an ideal intracorporeal lithotripter for ureteral calculi, with a high success rate and low morbidity.", "prediction_text": "The study reports a high success rate (96.7% at 3 months) and good safety profile for holmium:YAG laser lithotripsy in treating ureteral stones. However, the paper does not directly compare it to other intracorporeal lithotripters, so it cannot be definitively stated that it is the best option for all cases in the ureter."}
{"answers": "Our results suggested that s.c. anti-TNF pharmacokinetics do not significantly influence US-scored synovitis in RA patients.", "prediction_text": "The study found no significant difference in ultrasound-scored synovitis between peak and trough plasma drug concentration of subcutaneous anti-TNF agents in RA patients."}
