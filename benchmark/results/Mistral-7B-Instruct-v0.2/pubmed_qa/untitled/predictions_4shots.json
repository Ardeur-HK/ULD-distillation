{"answers": "These data suggest that being willing and fit enough for a chemotherapy protocol is a good prognostic factor for invasive bladder cancer. This eligibility bias emphasizes the need for prospective, randomized trials, and indicates that single-group studies using historical or matched controls have to be interpreted with caution.", "prediction_text": "The results of this study suggest that eligibility for a chemotherapy protocol after radical cystectomy for invasive bladder cancer is not associated with improved overall or recurrence-free survival. In fact, the protocol group had a slightly worse prognosis compared to the matched group. However, it is important to note that this was a retrospective analysis of a small study and further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "An additional delayed phase through the abdomen in routine contrast-enhanced CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis is of low yield, particularly if reliable follow-up imaging to further elucidate uncertain findings is available.", "prediction_text": "Delayed imaging in routine CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis can lead to the detection of incidental findings, but the benefits are outweighed by the increased radiation exposure and cost. The findings were mostly incidental and could have been confirmed with non-invasive follow-up imaging. Only one significant finding, a renal mass, was detected in the delayed phase that could not have been seen in the portal venous phase. Overall, the use of delayed imaging resulted in a significant increase in radiation dose and should be used selectively based on clinical indication."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that the SCL 90-R is best viewed as an indicator of unidimensional emotional distress and somatic effects of structural brain injury.", "prediction_text": "The SCL 90-R Obsessive-Compulsive subscale is not related to objective measures of attention and verbal memory in individuals with brain tumors. However, it is significantly related to symptoms of depression, anxiety, and subjective complaints of memory problems. The findings suggest that the SCL 90-R Obsessive-Compulsive dimension may reflect emotional distress rather than cognitive impairments."}
{"answers": "The results suggest that NA treatment can be stopped in selected patients with CHB as long as they are not cirrhotic, have completed a minimum period of treatment, have normal ALT and sustained undetectable DNA. These patients should be closely monitored during the first year and then indefinitely.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this observational study suggest that a significant proportion (54.54%) of patients with HBeAg-negative CHB who discontinued NA therapy experienced virological relapse, with the majority of relapses occurring within the first year after discontinuation. The decision to discontinue NA therapy in this patient population should be individualized and carefully considered based on factors such as treatment duration, age, and individual patient risk factors. Further studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods are needed to confirm these findings and to identify predictors of successful discontinuation."}
{"answers": "The results of this study do not support the hypothesis that there is a direct link between atmospheric pressure values and abdominal aortic aneurysm ruptures.", "prediction_text": "The diameter of the aneurysm is a more significant predictor of aortic aneurysm rupture than atmospheric pressure. The study did not find a statistically significant relationship between atmospheric pressure and aneurysm rupture, but there was a non-significant trend towards higher rupture of larger aneurysms (>7 cm) in cases where pressure increased between the day before and the day of rupture, particularly in patients with hypertension."}
{"answers": "Findings from these studies support discordance between device-recorded and self-reported hot flashes. In addition, the studies reveal further limitations of SSC monitoring, including difficulties with data collection and lack of consistency in interpretation. Based on these results and other recent trials identifying issues with SSC methodology, it is time to find a better physiologic surrogate measure for hot flashes.", "prediction_text": "The accuracy of the new sternal skin conductance (SSC) device in measuring hot flashes is questionable based on the low concordance rate (24%) between self-reported and device-recorded hot flashes in the second prototype. The acceptability of the device by women is reported to be acceptable but interferes with daily activities for some. Further research is needed to improve the device's functionality and accuracy."}
{"answers": ": Prophylactic fixation with a cephalomedullary nail was not found to be cost-effective for the average older woman who sustained a hip fracture. However, it may be appropriate for select patient populations. The study supports the need for basic science and clinical trials investigating the effectiveness of prophylactic fixation for patient populations at higher lifetime risk for contralateral hip fracture.", "prediction_text": "Prophylactic fixation of the uninjured hip can be cost-effective for preventing contralateral hip fractures in certain patient populations, such as women aged 71 to 75 years with a 30% greater relative risk for a contralateral fracture, and women younger than age 70. However, the cost-effectiveness of the procedure is highly dependent on the additional costs of the intervention and its effectiveness in reducing the risk of contralateral hip fracture."}
{"answers": "We found that USMLE Step 2, number of honors in medical school clerkships, and AOA membership demonstrated the strongest correlations with resident performance. Our goal in analyzing these data was to provide residency programs at large a sense of which criteria may be \"high yield\" in ranking applicants by analyzing data from within our own pool of residents. Similar studies across a broader scope of programs are warranted to confirm applicability of our findings. The continually emerging complexities of the field of orthopaedic surgery lend increasing importance to future work on the appropriate selection and training of orthopaedic residents.", "prediction_text": "Preresidency selection factors, such as USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 scores, Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) scores, number of clinical clerkship honors, number of letters of recommendation, number of away rotations, Alpha Omega Alpha (AOA) honor medical society membership, fourth-year subinternship at the institution, and number of publications, have varying degrees of correlation with both objective measures of resident performance, such as American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery (ABOS) Part I scores and Orthopaedics In-Training Exam (OITE) scores, and subjective ratings by faculty. Specifically, USMLE Step 1 and Step 2"}
{"answers": "In vitro fertilization outcome is strongly correlated with both maternal ages, basal cycle, day 3 follicle, stimulated hormone, and antral follicle assessment. Antral follicle assessment was a better predictor of in vitro fertilization outcome than were age or follicle stimulated hormone. Antral follicle assessment may provide a marker for ovarian age that is distinct from chronological age or hormonal markers.", "prediction_text": "Antral follicle assessment can provide additional predictive value beyond age and basal FSH levels in predicting IVF outcome. A higher number of antral follicles (>6) is associated with a higher clinical pregnancy rate and lower cancellation rate. However, larger studies are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Neither insertion of PEG tubes nor timing of insertion affect survival.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in survival between nursing home residents who received a feeding tube and those who did not, after accounting for selection bias. Additionally, the timing of feeding tube insertion did not impact survival in those who received a tube."}
{"answers": "In this well established early discharge program with nurse home visits, newborn metabolic screening is not compromised by early discharge.", "prediction_text": "Early discharge infants had a higher rate of inadequate initial filter paper specimens but were more likely to have an adequate specimen within the first 9 days of life due to a higher rate of repeat specimens. Overall, early discharge did not negatively impact the adequacy of newborn metabolic screening."}
{"answers": "The palliative treatment concept of 25\u00a0Gy applied in 5\u00a0fractions is sufficient for radiation of lung cancer, given that there was no obvious survival improvement in patients treated with the higher total dose regimen.", "prediction_text": "The present analysis did not find a statistically significant difference in overall survival between patients receiving 25 Gy in 5 fractions and 50 Gy in 20 fractions for palliative treatment of lung cancer. However, a subgroup analysis suggested that patients with a good-fair overall condition may benefit from the higher dose regimen, with a non-significant trend towards longer survival. Further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Although elevated leukocyte count and CRP value cannot effectively establish the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the elderly, unelevated values exclude it. Accordingly, appendectomy is not recommended to be performed in an elderly patient with unelevated leukocyte count and CRP value, although clinical symptoms and signs indicate acute appendicitis.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that leukocyte count and CRP measurements may not be reliable in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the elderly, as there were no statistically significant differences in these values between patients with uninflamed appendix and those with acute appendicitis. Furthermore, no patients with both values unelevated were found in the acute appendicitis group. However, larger studies are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrates that in patients at risk for cardiac morbidity undergoing vascular surgery, desflurane is effective to control intraoperative hypertension without fear of major cardiac depressant effect.", "prediction_text": "Desflurane does not significantly alter left ventricular function when used to control surgically-induced hypertension during aortic surgery. However, it does increase afterload as indicated by an increase in systemic vascular resistance index, end-systolic wall-stress, and left-ventricular stroke work index."}
{"answers": "Development of tolerance to gluten seems possible in some patients with CD. Further follow-up will show whether this tolerance is permanent or only a long-term return to latency. This feature may be associated with genetic characteristics, especially with HLA genotypes that differ from DQ2 or DQ8. More insight into the mechanisms of the development of gluten tolerance may help to distinguish those CD patients that might not require life-long GFD.", "prediction_text": "The study found that out of 53 patients with biopsy-proven celiac disease for over 10 years, only two showed no immunological or histological signs of the disease while consuming gluten. These findings suggest that true gluten tolerance in adult celiac patients is rare. However, more research is needed to confirm these results and to understand the mechanisms behind potential gluten tolerance."}
{"answers": "No home-prepared replacement milks in South Africa meet all estimated micronutrient and essential fatty acid requirements of infants aged<6 months. Commercial infant formula is the only replacement milk that meets all nutritional needs. Revisions of WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF HIV and infant feeding course replacement milk options are needed. If replacement milks are to provide total nutrition, preparations should include vegetable oils, such as soybean oil, as a source of linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids, and additional vitamins and minerals.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF-recommended replacement milks for infants of HIV-infected mothers do not meet the nutritional requirements for micronutrients and essential fatty acids in the South African context. Home-prepared replacement milks using powdered full cream milk and fresh full cream milk were less costly but still did not meet the recommended nutritional requirements. Commercial formula was more expensive but provided a more adequate nutritional profile. Further research is needed to identify affordable and feasible options for providing adequate nutrition to infants of HIV-infected mothers in this context."}
{"answers": "We have shown that eosinophilic inflammation of the airway wall may increase PD and that the association of eosinophil counts with ICSs may result in lessening the PD.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) can influence the perception of dyspnea (PD) during bronchoconstriction in asthma patients by reversing the effect of airway inflammation. However, the relationship between ICS use, eosinophil counts, bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), and PD is complex and depends on the presence of baseline airflow obstruction. The study found that in ICS-treated patients, eosinophil counts and BHR were negatively associated with PD, while in ICS-naive patients, eosinophil counts were positively associated with PD. The study also found that PD was related to B"}
{"answers": "High socioeconomic status was associated with a higher acceptance rate of preventive home visits, but the association was attenuated by invitational procedures. The results indicate that the social inequality in acceptance of publicly offered preventive services might decrease if municipalities adopt more proactive invitational procedures.", "prediction_text": "Older people with higher financial assets were more likely to accept preventive home visits, but this association was attenuated when adjusting for invitational procedures. The study suggests that older people with lower financial assets who were invited through a letter with a proposed date were more likely to accept the visits, but the findings had wide confidence intervals. The study does not provide conclusive evidence of social imbalance in acceptance rates of the preventive home visit programme. Further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "In the present study, FT and androstenedione were statistically significantly correlated with sexual desire in the total cohort of women. ADT-G did not correlate more strongly than circulating androgens with sexual desire and is therefore not superior to measuring circulating androgens by mass spectrometry.", "prediction_text": "In this study, free testosterone and androstenedione were found to be correlated with sexual desire in women overall, while total testosterone, free testosterone, androstenedione, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were correlated with sexual desire in a subgroup of women aged 25-44 years. No correlation was found between androsterone glucuronide and sexual desire. The results suggest that androgens, particularly free testosterone and androstenedione, may play a role in sexual desire in women. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine the clinical significance of measuring androgens and their metabolites for assess"}
{"answers": "The results of these analyses suggest that marginally higher rates of depression to age 35 amongst the comorbid MD/AUD group were explained by increased exposure to adverse childhood circumstances amongst members of the comorbid group. Adolescent MD/AUD comorbidity is likely to be a risk marker, rather than a causal factor in subsequent MD.", "prediction_text": "The presence of both major depression and alcohol use disorder during adolescence is associated with poorer subsequent depression outcomes, but this association may be explained by confounding factors such as gender, childhood behavior problems, and exposure to physical and sexual abuse. The data used were self-reported and may be subject to biases."}
{"answers": "There are no statistically apparent motion differences between SUP-CTV and INF-CTV. Current uniform planning target volume (PTV) margins are adequate to cover both portions of the CTV.", "prediction_text": "No statistically significant differences in interfractional motion were found between the superior and inferior portions of the prostate bed clinical target volume using RTOG consensus definitions and daily CT on rails imaging."}
{"answers": "Combined end points for adverse events are acceptable in the octogenarian. Carotid endarterectomy remains the gold standard for treatment of extracranial carotid disease in all age groups. Age alone should not place patients in the high-risk category for carotid endarterectomy.", "prediction_text": "Based on the data from this study, octogenarians do not necessarily have a higher risk for perioperative complications during carotid endarterectomy, as evidenced by a low rate of neurologic events and no deaths in the study population. However, it is important to note that this study only included 103 procedures and larger studies are needed to confirm these findings. Additionally, careful patient selection and appropriate risk assessment are crucial for successful outcomes in older adults undergoing carotid endarterectomy."}
{"answers": "Lysosomotropic amines in combination with cyclosporine appear to be synergistic in the suppression of T-cell proliferation to MiHC and MHC. Use of chloroquine in combination with cyclosporine may result in improved control of GVHD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the combination of lysosomotropic amines (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) and cyclosporine can result in synergistic immunosuppression on T-cell responses to both minor and major histocompatibility antigens. The mechanism of action is likely different from current immune suppressant drugs like cyclosporine. However, chloroquine can also decrease T-cell viability at high concentrations and inhibit MHC class II expression in antigen-presenting cells. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and understand the underlying mechanisms."}
{"answers": "The results of this study suggest that the cardiovascular response to exercise training may be different in men and women. Women may benefit more from interventions aimed to increase physical activity as a tool for prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.", "prediction_text": "Exercise training leads to a lower heart rate and higher heart rate variability in both genders. Trained women have a shorter QT interval compared to sedentary women, while QT interval remains unchanged in trained men. Exercise training also reduces the QT/RR slope in both genders, with a more pronounced effect in women. These findings suggest that exercise training may impact the relationship between heart rate and ventricular repolarization differently in men and women."}
{"answers": "Although BD is correlated with GCS at presentation and RTS, it is not a reliable prognostic marker for outcome and mortality in patients with isolated TBI.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a statistically significant correlation between base deficit and mortality in patients with severe traumatic brain injury. However, there was a negative correlation between base deficit and Glasgow Coma Scale and Revised Trauma Score. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "\"Aquagenic maladies\" could be a pediatric form of the aquagenic urticaria.", "prediction_text": "The presented case series suggests that syncope during bathing in infants may be related to aquagenic urticaria, a form of water-induced hives. Further research is needed to confirm this association and to understand the underlying mechanisms. Symptoms improved in some infants after avoiding water exposure, but long-term follow-up revealed that some continued to experience issues with water or sun."}
{"answers": "Laparoscopic procedures caused detectable damage to Kupffer and endothelial cells as reflected by elevation of post-operative HA serum levels. The damage to the liver hepatocytes and perisinusoidal cells has no clinical significance and the laparoscopic procedure itself is the probable cause of the Kupffer and endothelial cells damage, while other mechanisms caused damage to the hepatocytes.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find any significant changes in peri-sinusoidal cell function, as measured by beta-N-acetyl hexosaminidase (beta-NAH) levels, in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, an increase in hyaluronic acid (HA) levels and post-operative elevation of AST and ALT were observed in the study group. Further research is needed to fully understand the impact of laparoscopic procedures on peri-sinusoidal cell function."}
{"answers": "Sleep disorders are common in the general adult population of Japan. Correction for reporting heterogeneity using anchoring vignettes is not a necessary tool for proper management of sleep and energy related problems among Japanese adults. Older age, gender differences in communicating sleep-related problems, the presence of multiple morbidities, and regular exercise should be the focus of policies and clinical practice to improve sleep and energy management in Japan.", "prediction_text": "Yes, adjusting for reporting heterogeneity in self-reports of sleep disorders is necessary to accurately identify factors associated with sleep disorders in adult Japanese populations. The use of anchoring vignettes in statistical models, such as the Compound Hierarchical Ordered Probit (CHOPIT) model, can help account for individual differences in response category cut-points and provide more accurate estimates of associations."}
{"answers": "Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is often challenging in men on account of more adhesions and inflammation. This leads to higher conversion rates and more postoperative complications. Optimized planning and a more experienced operating surgeon may help overcome these problems.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that male sex is an independent risk factor for conversion to open cholecystectomy and biliary injuries during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Men also had longer operative times and higher rates of bile duct injuries, gallbladder perforation, and gallstone spillage. However, there were no significant differences in mean hospital stay, wound infection, or port-site herniation between men and women."}
{"answers": "To uphold the notion for radiation exposure to be as low as reasonably achievable, ureteroscopic stone retrieval can safely be done without the use of fluoroscopy in a significant number of patients.", "prediction_text": "The study demonstrates that fluoroscopy is not essential for the successful retrieval of lower ureteric stones through ureteroscopy. The procedure can be performed effectively without the use of fluoroscopy in most cases. However, it may still be required in certain situations such as complex anatomy or difficult stone removal."}
{"answers": "Surrogates of injury severity, including days in the ICU and non-ICU hospital LOS>10 days, were associated with the development of HO in our cohort of acetabular fracture patients. Prophylaxis with XRT was significantly protective against the development of HO, and the ability to provide prophylaxis is very likely related to the severity of injury.", "prediction_text": "In this retrospective study, length of stay in the ICU, non-ICU stay longer than 10 days, and HO prophylaxis with external radiation beam therapy were found to be significant predictors of heterotopic ossification (HO) development and severity in patients with acetabular fractures treated with a posterior approach. Injury severity score was not found to be significantly associated with HO."}
{"answers": "In this series of 35 patients, the use of epidural analgesia for HIPEC does not seem to be associated with a worse risk of haemodynamic instability, spinal haematoma, meningitis or epidural abscess. HIPEC with platinum salt is not incompatible with the safety of epidural analgesia, with an optimized fluid management peroperatively and the following of perimedullary anesthesia practice guidelines.", "prediction_text": "Based on the data from this retrospective study, the use of epidural analgesia during and after cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC did not result in any reported cases of spinal haematoma, meningitis, or epidural abscess. However, caution should be exercised in patients with thrombopenia or coagulation disorders before catheter removal."}
{"answers": "The Diabeo system improved glycaemic control in both high and low users who avidly used the IDA function, while the greatest improvement was seen in the low users who had the motivational support of teleconsultations.", "prediction_text": "The use of a smartphone with an insulin dose advisor (IDA) alone can lead to some improvement in glycaemic control in high users, but the addition of telemonitoring and teleconsultation functions can result in greater improvement, particularly in low users. Therefore, technology alone may not be sufficient to optimally improve glycaemic control in all patients with type 1 diabetes."}
{"answers": "Despite a lower risk of breast cancer, the Sami attended the NBCSP more frequently than the control group. The recall and cancer detection rate was lower among the Sami compared with the non-Sami group.", "prediction_text": "The Sami population had a higher attendance rate and lower recall rate in the Norwegian Breast Cancer Screening Program compared to the non-Sami population. However, the rate of invasive cancer detected and the percentage of all breast cancers detected were not significantly different between the two groups. Further research is needed to understand the underlying reasons for these findings."}
{"answers": "GP ablation did not prove to be beneficial for postoperative stable NSR. A complete left atrial lesion set and biatrial ablation are advisable for improving rhythm outcomes. Randomized controlled trials are necessary to confirm our findings.", "prediction_text": "The absence of ganglionated plexi ablation during a Cox-Maze IV procedure was not found to be a significant predictor of long-term stable sinus rhythm in patients with persistent or long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation. Other factors, such as duration of AF, left atrial diameter, left atrial area, absence of connecting lesions, and absence of right atrial ablation were found to be independent predictors of AF recurrence."}
{"answers": "It is concluded that serum pancreatic lipase is a more accurate biomarker of acute pancreatitis than serum amylase.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, serum pancreatic lipase has a higher diagnostic accuracy for acute pancreatitis compared to serum amylase, with a higher area under the curve (AUC) in the receiver operating characteristic analysis. However, it is important to note that both biomarkers have their limitations and false negatives can still occur. Therefore, while serum pancreatic lipase may be a more accurate marker, it should not completely replace serum amylase in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. A combination of clinical symptoms, imaging, and both biomarkers may be the most effective approach for accurate diagnosis."}
{"answers": "Transgastric endoscopic splenectomy in a porcine model appears technically feasible. Additional long-term survival experiments are planned.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study demonstrates the technical feasibility of performing transgastric endoscopic splenectomy using a flexible endoscope in a porcine model. No complications were reported during the procedure and visualization of the spleen and other intraperitoneal organs was good. Further studies are needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this approach in clinical settings."}
{"answers": "Brachial systolic blood pressure difference is related to the severity of SSS and can be used as a screening tool for SSS. However, it performed better in severe steal than milder steal phenomena.", "prediction_text": "The presence of a significant side-to-side difference in systolic blood pressure can be used as a screening tool for subclavian steal syndrome (SSS). However, the specific waveform type of the vertebral artery (systolic deceleration, alternating flow, or complete reversal) can also influence the size of the blood pressure difference. In this study, a larger blood pressure difference was observed in the complete reversal and alternating flow groups compared to the systolic deceleration group, suggesting that the severity of SSS may be related to the waveform type. However, further research is needed to confirm this finding and to establish the optimal cut-off value for the blood pressure difference to"}
{"answers": "a-tDCS could be useful in identifying residual connectivity markers in clinically-defined UWS, who may lack of purposeful behavior as a result of a motor-output failure.", "prediction_text": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (a-tDCS) can potentially differentiate unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) from minimally conscious state (MCS) patients by revealing residual networks and improving cortical connectivity and excitability in some UWS patients. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings and establish the clinical utility of a-tDCS in this population."}
{"answers": "Most people in France are influenced by situational factors when deciding if a physician should breach confidentiality to protect the spouse of a patient infected with STD.", "prediction_text": "Lay people and psychologists generally find it more acceptable than physicians to breach confidentiality to protect a patient's wife from a sexually transmitted disease. The patient's intentions to protect his wife and inform her of the disease have the greatest impact on acceptability. However, there is variability among lay people, with some finding it always acceptable, some depending on the circumstances, some requiring consultation with an expert, and some finding it never acceptable."}
{"answers": "Most students do not encounter all 10 conditions during patient encounters throughout a 4-week EM rotation, although most have exposure to at least eight. Certain conditions are far less likely than others to be encountered, and may need to be taught in a nonclinical setting.", "prediction_text": "The study found that while most medical students encountered a majority of the recommended core conditions during their EM clerkship, not all students met the standard of encountering all 10 conditions. The average number of core conditions seen per student was 8.4, with significant variation in the percentage of students who saw each condition. Further efforts may be needed to ensure that students have adequate clinical exposure to all core conditions during their EM education."}
{"answers": "The findings indicate that the clinical significance of symptomatic BDS is similar to that of CBD stones. Bile duct sludge seems to be an early stage of choledocholithiasis.", "prediction_text": "Bile duct sludge and bile duct stones have some similarities, but there are also differences in their clinical significance. Bile duct sludge is more common in females and is less likely to be associated with common bile duct dilation and recurrence after endoscopic therapy compared to bile duct stones. However, more research is needed to fully understand the clinical implications of bile duct sludge."}
{"answers": "Routine placement of nasogastric tube in patients operated of LSG seems not useful in reducing leaks' incidence.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that the use of nasogastric decompression after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy may reduce the risk of staple line leaks, as no leaks were observed in the group without nasogastric tubes. However, longer postoperative hospital stays were observed in the group with nasogastric decompression. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "The results obtained in this study demonstrate that LUS is an accurate and highly sensitive procedure in staging colorectal cancer, providing a useful and reliable diagnostic tool complementary to laparoscopy.", "prediction_text": "Laparoscopic ultrasonography (LUS) is a reliable and sensitive procedure for staging colorectal cancer, particularly in the evaluation of hepatic metastases and nodal metastases. However, it has a lower specificity compared to preoperative staging and laparoscopy. LUS can significantly impact the therapeutic program in a considerable number of cases."}
{"answers": "Most community providers believe IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion; this belief is associated with increased resource use. Experts comply more closely with guidelines to diagnose IBS with minimal testing. This disconnect suggests that better implementation of guidelines is warranted to minimize variation and improve cost-effectiveness of care.", "prediction_text": "According to guidelines, IBS is not a diagnosis of exclusion, but beliefs and testing proclivity among healthcare providers vary. IBS experts were less likely to consider IBS a diagnosis of exclusion and ordered fewer tests compared to nonexperts."}
{"answers": "Correlation between level of radiographic transition zone on contrast enema and length of aganglionosis remains low. Systematic preoperative biopsy by coelioscopy or ombilical incision is mandatory.", "prediction_text": "The correlation between the radiographic transition zone and the length of aganglionosis in Hirschsprung's disease is inaccurate, with a Kappa coefficient of agreement of 0.39 (CI [0.24; 0.57]). Improving preoperative planning requires further investigation."}
{"answers": "The presence of a high signal intensity change on T2-weighted MRI and the pyramidal tract sign can be used as prognostic factors for patients with CSA.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the presence of T2 high signal intensity areas on MRI and the conversion to surgery are associated with a poorer neurological recovery in patients with cervical spondylotic amyotrophy. Additionally, the presence of a pyramidal tract sign may also indicate a poorer prognosis after surgery."}
{"answers": "We conclude that not all low-tone sudden deafness (SD) patients suffered from endolymphatic hydrops even if they had vertigo attack at the onset and that electrocochleography (ECochG) was a useful prognostic tool.", "prediction_text": "Not all cases of low-tone sudden deafness progress to Meniere's disease. The presence of vertigo and recurrent episodes increases the likelihood of Meniere's disease, but not all cases with these symptoms will develop it. The average -SP/AP ratio is smaller in cases with a single episode compared to those with recurrent episodes and Meniere's disease."}
{"answers": "It is concluded that ACE-DD genotype may be a risk factor for the causation and development of chronic kidney failure among hypertensive patients.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that the D allele of the ACE-1 gene may be associated with an increased risk for chronic kidney disease among hypertensive patients. However, the findings should be interpreted with caution due to the relatively small sample size and the need for further research to confirm these results."}
{"answers": "Older people with a history of amblyopia who develop visual loss in the previously normal eye can experience recovery of visual function in the amblyopic eye over a period of time. This recovery in visual function occurs in the wake of visual loss in the fellow eye and the improvement appears to be sustained.", "prediction_text": "No, visual improvement in amblyopic eyes, which are not affected by macular degeneration, has been reported in some cases. The improvement can range from 1 to 12 months from baseline and remains stable over the follow-up period."}
{"answers": "These results suggest that quantitative real-time PCR assays for BCRABL detection can be comparable between laboratories despite significant differences in methodologies if the same positive control cell line and quality control gene are used. It is imperative that some level of assay standardization be adopted between laboratories, not only for patients who are monitored at different facilities, but also for larger investigative studies in which hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular responses are to be compared.", "prediction_text": "The study demonstrates a strong correlation (r(s) = 0.9435, p<0.00001) between the results of BCRABL transcript detection by quantitative real-time PCR at two different laboratories, despite differences in RNA isolation technique, cDNA synthesis, BCR control cell line, and PCR primer and probe sequences. This suggests that correlated results are possible from homebrew assays for BCRABL transcript detection. However, it is important to note that the use of standardized methodology and quality control measures are crucial for accurate and consistent results."}
{"answers": "Although the exact mechanism of SSDH in this case is unclear, we speculate that this SSDH was a hematoma that migrated from the intracranial subdural space. Low CSF pressure because of continuous drainage and intrathecal thrombolytic therapy may have played an important role in the migration of the hematoma through the spinal canal. It is important to recognize the SSDH as a possible complication of the SAH accompanied with intracranial subdural hematoma.", "prediction_text": "Yes, this case report describes a rare occurrence of a spinal subdural hematoma following a ruptured intracranial aneurysm. The exact mechanism of this association is not well understood and requires further investigation."}
{"answers": "LAA occlusion device resulted in a slightly movement in QRS axis, reduced HR and increased the mean-mean QT interval duration. In addition, LA diameter and ARD seemed to be larger after device implantation.", "prediction_text": "The present study found that LAA occlusion device implantation resulted in slight changes in QRS electric axis, heart rate, and QT interval on ECG. No significant differences were observed in echocardiographic parameters before and after implantation. However, a larger LA diameter was detected during follow-up at 6 months, and a larger aortic root diameter was detected during follow-up at 12 months. These findings suggest that LAA occlusion device implantation may have subtle effects on echocardiography and ECG parameters over time. Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of these findings."}
{"answers": "The study results suggested that spinal cord untethering may be unnecessary in patients with MM who are undergoing scoliosis corrective surgery and do not present with clinical symptoms of a tethered cord, even though tethering is radiographically demonstrated.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that scoliosis correction can be safely performed in patients with myelomeningocele without prior untethering, as no new neurological complications were observed in the patients in this series. However, individualized decision-making and close monitoring are necessary. Further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Under the conditions of this study, pulpotomy offered a viable alternative to root canal treatment for teeth with vital pulps in the short term. However, there is insufficient clinical evidence to consider this technique for the treatment of every permanent tooth. Nevertheless, it should be considered as a potential alternative approach to be further developed for future applications.", "prediction_text": "Based on the data from this study, the survival rate of teeth treated with pulp chamber pulpotomy using ProRoot MTA and followed up for 12 to 24 months was estimated to be 82%. However, two teeth required root canal treatment for pain control and one for prosthetic reasons. Therefore, while pulp chamber pulpotomy can be considered as a viable treatment option, it may not be permanent and the need for additional treatment should be anticipated."}
{"answers": "The site of access in our study does not appear to influence complications specifically neural injury or recurrence rates.", "prediction_text": "The site of endovenous access (above or below mid-calf level) did not significantly influence early outcomes of endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) for small saphenous varicose veins, including complications and recurrence rates. Both groups showed significant improvement in clinical and patient-reported outcomes up to 1 year."}
{"answers": "Retinal haemorrhages following a convulsive episode are rare. Such a finding should trigger an extensive search for other reasons, including child abuse.", "prediction_text": "The finding of a retinal hemorrhage after a convulsive episode in a child should prompt further investigation to rule out underlying systemic disorders or child abuse. However, this case report suggests that simple febrile convulsions may rarely be associated with retinal hemorrhages. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to establish the true prevalence and significance of this association."}
{"answers": "Clear and distinct differences between the two studied groups were found indicating the root of this increased confidence may have developed due to exposure to the Pathway program.", "prediction_text": "The Global Longitudinal Pathway medical education curriculum has a positive influence on medical students' skills and attitudes toward working with culturally diverse populations, as evidenced by statistically significant differences in confidence ratings and qualitative findings."}
{"answers": "In normal daily practice, only a small number of clinically important adenomas are missed. The problem of missed adenomas probably is being exaggerated.", "prediction_text": "Based on the data from this study, it appears that only a very small percentage (1.3%) of colorectal cancers may be due to missed adenomas during previous endoscopies. However, it is important to note that this study has limitations, including a small number of patients with a previous endoscopy and the assumption that all cancers developed from adenomas. Further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Emotional prosody, therefore, seems to be partially processed outside the focus of spatial attention. Whereas at early sensory processing stages spatial attention modulates the degree of emotional voice processing as a function of emotional valence, emotional prosody is processed outside of the focus of spatial attention at later processing stages.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the processing of affective prosody is influenced by spatial attention, with interactions occurring at early processing stages and additive effects at later stages."}
{"answers": "Pancreas retransplantation is a safe procedure with acceptable graft survival that should be proposed to diabetic patients who have lost their primary graft.", "prediction_text": "Yes, pancreas retransplantation can provide a second chance for type 1 diabetic patients with end-stage renal disease who have lost their primary graft. The study shows that second pancreas graft survival is significantly better than their first graft survival, and patient survival is excellent. Pancreas retransplantation had no negative impact on kidney graft function and survival."}
{"answers": "Weekend hospitalization leads to delayed provision of intensive procedures and elevated 1-year mortality for elderly AMI patients. The existence of measurable differences in treatments raises questions regarding the efficacy of a single input regulation (e.g., mandated nurse staffing ratios) in enhancing the quality of weekend care. My results suggest that targeted financial incentives might be a more cost-effective policy response than broad regulation aimed at improving quality.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that Medicare patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction on weekends are less likely to receive immediate intensive cardiac procedures and experience higher rates of adverse health outcomes, including increased mortality and readmission, compared to weekday patients. This indicates that weekend care may not be of the same quality as weekday care. However, it's important to note that this study focuses on Medicare patients and the findings may not be generalizable to other populations or healthcare systems. Further research is needed to confirm these results and to identify the underlying causes of the observed differences in care quality."}
{"answers": "The presence of more than one virus in hospitalized children with ARI is very frequent but it does not seem to have a major clinical impact in terms of severity. However bacterial superinfection increases the severity of the disease course. On the contrary, pneumococcal vaccination plays a protective role.", "prediction_text": "The presence of viral co-infection in children with acute respiratory infection does not directly correlate with disease severity. However, bacterial superinfection and lack of pneumococcal vaccination are independent predictors of increased severity."}
{"answers": "In our study, it was observed that although longer ETA was associated with longer hospitalization, ETA was not correlated with postoperative complications. Our results inclined toward the position that appendectomy can be performed as a semielective surgery.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant association between the time from emergency room registration to appendectomy (ETA) and the incidence of perforation or postoperative complications in patients with acute appendicitis. However, patients with longer ETA did have longer hospital stays. Other factors, such as age, neutrophil count, and open appendectomy, were found to be significant predictors of postoperative complications."}
{"answers": "Fetal gender does not affect the risk of having an ED visit for asthma during pregnancy, and it is not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes among women who had an asthma-related ED during pregnancy.", "prediction_text": "No, fetal gender is not associated with an increased risk of having an emergency department visit for asthma during pregnancy. Additionally, fetal gender was not found to be a predictor of adverse pregnancy outcomes among women who had an asthma ED visit during pregnancy."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that working exposure increases the risk or leads to the clinical manifestation of rotator cuff tears. Although a detailed analysis of individual physical exposure is not available yet, the statistical results indicate that rotator cuff tears must be taken into consideration as a result of ergonomic exposure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, based on the findings of this study, there is a significant association between rotator cuff tears and occupations in agriculture and forestry, as well as in the building industry. However, more research is needed to establish a causal relationship."}
{"answers": "High-quality training, strict compliance with evidence-based guidelines, and thorough documentation is associated with significant reductions in CLABSIs. Mindful organizing may lead to a better understanding of what goes into a unit's ability to handle peak demands and sustain extraordinary performance in the long-term.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a zero central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) rate is sustainable with the implementation and maintenance of evidence-based measures, including standardized care practices, ongoing training, surveillance, and vigilance. However, continued efforts are necessary to maintain this rate and prevent any potential increases."}
{"answers": "Ketamine sedation was successful and well tolerated in all cases. The use of atropine as an adjunct for intramuscular ketamine sedation in children significantly reduces hypersalivation and may lower the incidence of post-procedural vomiting. Atropine is associated with a higher incidence of a transient rash. No serious adverse events were noted.", "prediction_text": "Atropine as an adjunct to ketamine sedation in children undergoing minor painful procedures may reduce hypersalivation but increases the risk of transient rash and vomiting during recovery. The decision to use atropine should be based on the individual child's risk-benefit profile and the severity of the procedure. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Findings depict wandering and PNA as overlapping, but nonequivalent phenomena. Evidence supporting construct validity of wandering was more robust than that for PNA. Results have implications for accuracy in scientific and clinical detection and labeling of wandering and agitation.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, wandering and physically nonaggressive agitation (PNA) are not equivalent concepts. While there is a significant correlation between the two, wandering has a stronger association with PNA Factor 1, and a weaker association with PNA Factor 2. The study suggests that wandering and PNA are distinct behaviors."}
{"answers": "An advance care planning model is feasible for community palliative care services. Quality audit processes are an essential component of the Model with documentation of advance care planning discussion established as an important outcome measure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the implementation of an advance care planning model in community palliative care is feasible. The success of the program depends on organizational commitment, staff training, and adapting the model to the specific community context. The focus should be on facilitating advance care planning conversations and involving families, rather than solely on document completion. Ongoing quality improvement processes are essential to embed the model into routine practice."}
{"answers": "The study allows us to determine that FB can move through the body but not towards the heart. The study also serves as a warning sign: in cases of prolonged histories of FB ingestion, imaging studies are mandatory before endoscopic examination.", "prediction_text": "Yes, foreign bodies can migrate through the body, and in some cases, they may move towards the heart. The mechanisms of migration include local inflammation, peristalsis, and erosion of surrounding tissues. Diagnosis can be challenging and may require a combination of clinical, radiologic, endoscopic, and ultrasound evaluations. Early detection and removal of the foreign body is crucial to prevent complications."}
{"answers": "Although most players in the study believe that rugby headgear may prevent concussion, only a minority reported wearing it. Coaches tended to be less convinced than the players that rugby headgear can prevent concussion.", "prediction_text": "While players believe that headgear can prevent concussion, coaches are less convinced and only a minority of players actually use it. The reasons for not wearing headgear include it not being mandatory, discomfort, and cost. The preventive effect of headgear on concussion is not definitively established. Further research is needed to determine the role of headgear in concussion prevention."}
{"answers": "Early oral intake is possible after laparotomy and colorectal resection. Thus, the laparoscopic surgeon's claim of early tolerated oral intake may not be unique to laparoscopy.", "prediction_text": "The results of this study suggest that early postoperative feeding after laparotomy and colorectal resection is possible, but it may be associated with a higher rate of vomiting compared to traditional feeding methods. However, there was no significant difference in the duration of postoperative ileus or overall hospitalization length between the two groups. Therefore, early postoperative oral intake is not limited to laparoscopic surgery."}
{"answers": "Both medial and lateral PTS were significantly steeper in failures of ACLR than the control group. Medial or lateral PTS \u22655\u00b0 was a new risk factor of ACLR failure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that patients with ACL reconstruction failures had significantly steeper medial and lateral posterior tibial slopes compared to the control group. The odds ratio for ACLR failure was 6.8 for medial PTS \u2265 5\u00b0 and 10.8 for lateral PTS \u2265 5\u00b0."}
{"answers": "These results suggest the need to provide interventions that are specifically designed to increase awareness of potential stroke signs and symptoms and appropriate subsequent clinical actions.", "prediction_text": "The study found that only 14% of elderly patients correctly endorsed their intention to call 911 when presented with signs and symptoms of stroke using a standardized questionnaire. Factors associated with a higher likelihood of correct endorsement include higher levels of education. However, on average, the correct response was chosen only 37% of the time."}
{"answers": "We conclude that routine CXR after bronchoscopy with TBB is necessary only in patients with symptoms suggestive of pneumothorax. In asymptomatic patients, pneumothorax is rare and usually small, so routine CXR is not necessary in this category of patients.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, routine chest radiography after transbronchial biopsy may not be necessary in all cases, as most pneumothoraces were detected based on clinical symptoms. However, it is still recommended for patients with large pneumothoraces or symptoms suggestive of pneumothorax."}
{"answers": "Early surfactant administration is associated with shorter duration of ventilation but does not appear to be significantly protective against CLD/mortality among premature infants. This may support the growing evidence for consideration of CPAP as an alternative to routine intubation and early surfactant administration. Further investigation from large randomized clinical trials is warranted to confirm these results.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that early surfactant administration within one hour of birth does not significantly reduce the risk of chronic lung disease or mortality in preterm infants compared to late surfactant administration. However, early surfactant treatment was associated with longer ventilation, CPAP, and hospital stay. Further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "The study supports the hypothesis that nurses' aides who were exposed to ETS at home during childhood have an increased risk of long-term sickness absence.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that individuals who were exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) during childhood had an increased risk of long-term sick leave, specifically for neck pain, high back pain, low back pain, and any illness, even after adjusting for various demographic and lifestyle factors. The risk was also increased for sick leave exceeding 8 weeks."}
{"answers": "We concluded that depiction of the superior wall of the mandibular canal cannot be improved by changing the thickness of images.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that 0.9 mm-thick double-oblique CT images provide the best mandibular depiction in the alveolar crest and the whole of the mandibular canal. However, there is no significant difference in mandibular depiction between 0.3 mm and 0.9 mm-thick images."}
{"answers": "Exclusive CRT approach is not safe to treat patients with low infiltrative rectal carcinoma.", "prediction_text": "Preoperative chemoradiation (CRT) can be an option for mid and low rectal tumors to reduce local recurrence and improve resection, but it is not without risks. In this study, 17.9% of patients who underwent CRT and surgery had local recurrences. Five-year overall survival was negatively affected by lymph node metastases and perineural invasion. The decision to use CRT instead of surgery should be individualized based on patient factors and tumor characteristics."}
{"answers": "Random survival forests did not yield higher performance compared to Cox proportional hazards. We found improvement in prediction performance when coupling the genetic SNP score with clinical/demographic markers, which warrants further investigation.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that adding validated susceptibility SNP scores to risk models for BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers can improve predictive ability, but the improvement is modest with an average 1 - c-index value of 0.221 for BRCA1 and 0.215 for BRCA2. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine the clinical utility of SNP testing in the context of breast cancer risk assessment."}
{"answers": "Bedtime NPH insulin added to maximal therapy with sulfonylurea and metformin is an effective, simple, well-tolerated approach for patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes.", "prediction_text": "In this study, adding insulin to ongoing oral hypoglycemic agents resulted in better glycemic control with fewer hypoglycemic events and less weight gain compared to insulin monotherapy in insulin-naive type 2 diabetes patients. However, there was a higher rate of treatment failures in the insulin-in-addition group. The decision to start insulin in type 2 diabetes should be individualized, taking into account factors such as patient preference, glycemic control goals, and the risk of hypoglycemia. This study suggests that adding insulin to oral hypoglycemic agents may be an effective option for some patients, but close monitoring and adjustment of ins"}
{"answers": "PET data show that amoxapine's profile is very similar to that of the established atypical antipsychotics. These data, together with amoxapine's in vitro pharmacologic profile, effectiveness in animal models, and efficacy in psychotic depression raise the possibility of amoxapine as an \"atypical\" antipsychotic agent in the treatment of schizophrenia.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this PET study, amoxapine can be considered an atypical antipsychotic with high 5-HT2 occupancy and greater 5-HT2 than D2 occupancy, and a lower risk of extrapyramidal side effects when D2 occupancy remains below 80%."}
{"answers": "In gravid ewes, intravenous infusion of<or = 1.67 micrograms/min epinephrine altered neither maternal hemodynamics nor uterine blood flow. To the extent that sheep data can be extrapolated to humans, these results suggest that continuous intravenous infusion of epinephrine in local anesthetic solutions is safe if the epidural catheter should enter a blood vessel during the infusion.", "prediction_text": "The results of this study suggest that continuous intravenous infusion of low-concentration epinephrine does not impair uterine blood flow in pregnant ewes. However, a bolus injection of epinephrine did decrease uterine blood flow significantly."}
{"answers": "These data indicate that major blunt trauma enhances the migratory capacity of circulating neutrophils. This is manifest within 2 hrs of admission and may be attributable to alteration in interleukin-8 receptor expression, affinity, or downstream signaling. In patients who later develop ARDS, initially elevated circulating neutrophil counts decrease rapidly, over the same time course. Early enhanced neutrophil migratory activity coupled with elevated pulmonary concentrations of interleukin-8 may be central to the establishment of the neutrophil infiltration that is characteristic of ARDS.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study provides evidence that neutrophils isolated from major trauma patients exhibit an enhanced migratory response to interleukin-8 during the first 24 hours, which may contribute to the development of ARDS. However, further research is needed to confirm this finding and establish the exact role of neutrophil migratory activity in the pathogenesis of ARDS."}
{"answers": "Memory provocation increased the sensitivity of rCBF-SPECT for the detection of AD-related blood flow changes in the brain at the group level. Further studies are needed to evaluate MP-SPECT as a diagnostic tool at the individual level. If a higher sensitivity for AD at the individual level is verified in future studies, a single MP-SPECT study might be sufficient in the clinical setting.", "prediction_text": "Memory-provoked rCBF-SPECT (MP-SPECT) can improve the diagnostic sensitivity of rCBF-SPECT in differentiating Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients from healthy elderly by revealing significant rCBF reduction in the left parietal cortex during memory tasks. However, larger studies are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "1. DBE is a safe and and accurate method to diagnose small bowel disorders; 2. this method permits chromoscopy, biopsies and treatment of the lesions.", "prediction_text": "Double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) is an effective method for diagnosing small-bowel disorders, achieving a diagnostic yield of 75% (33/44 cases) and therapeutic yield of 63.6%. It is a safe procedure with minor complications in most cases."}
{"answers": "Reorganization of care to offer a primary angioplasty service was acceptable to patients and their carers. Satisfaction levels were high regardless of the type of care received, with the exception of discharge and aftercare.", "prediction_text": "Based on the study, patient satisfaction with primary angioplasty was higher for some aspects of care such as speed of treatment, but lower for convenience of visiting for carers. Patient and carer satisfaction with overall care was high at both intervention and control sites. The study suggests that primary angioplasty is an acceptable alternative to thrombolysis, but the added inconvenience for carers should be considered. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and assess long-term outcomes."}
{"answers": "The leukocyte count at presentation can be used as an adjunct in the evaluation of the severity of injury in blunt trauma patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the leukocyte count at presentation is correlated with the severity of injury in blunt trauma patients, as indicated by a positive correlation with the Injury Severity Score (ISS) and a negative correlation with the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and the Revised Trauma Score (RTS)."}
{"answers": "Right ventricular recovery following PVR for chronic significant pulmonary regurgitation after repair of TOF may be compromised in the adult population. In order to maintain adequate RV contractility, pulmonary valve implant in these patients should be considered before RV function deteriorates.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that adult patients with chronic pulmonary regurgitation following repair of tetralogy of Fallot who undergo pulmonary valve replacement have unchanged RV volumes and function, but only a subset of those with pre-operative RVEF > 0.40 maintain this post-operatively. This raises the question of optimal surgical timing to prevent RV dysfunction and improve outcomes."}
{"answers": "Combined approach tympanoplasty (CAT) allows for successful treatment of cholesteatoma with rates of recurrent and residual disease comparable to open mastoid surgery. Early timing of second-look procedures allows easier removal of any recurrent or residual disease, which reduces the conversion rate to open mastoidectomy.", "prediction_text": "The study reports a 19.7% rate of cholesteatoma at second-look surgery, with 10.6% being residual disease and 9.09% being recurrent disease. The majority of cases were easily removed, and only 3% required conversion to a modified radical mastoidectomy. However, the study does not provide information on whether early second-look tympanoplasty reduces the rate of conversion to modified radical mastoidectomy. Further research is needed to answer this question."}
{"answers": "In 1995, the first year that the MQSA was in effect, there was a significant improvement in the quality of mammography in North Carolina. This improvement probably resulted from facilities' compliance with federal regulations.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA) of 1992 had a positive impact on mammography quality in North Carolina, as evidenced by an increase in the percentage of facilities meeting quality standards and improvements in passing rates for phantom scores, darkroom fog, and temperature difference."}
{"answers": "HIE was associated with reduced repeat imaging in EDs. This study is among the first to find empirical support for this anticipated benefit of HIE.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the adoption of health information exchange (HIE) is associated with a significant reduction in repeat imaging in emergency departments (EDs) for computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, and chest x-ray, reflecting reductions of 44%-67% relative to sample means."}
{"answers": "Gestational age misclassification is an unlikely explanation for the reported divergence in average birth-weights for Aborigines and whites. The results might help with the interpretation of other between-population comparisons.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that gestational age misclassification may not fully explain the difference in birthweights between Australian Aborigines and whites, as the effect of misclassification was minimal for summary measures at full term and the 10th centiles, but significant for the 90th centiles. Further research is needed to identify other potential explanations for the observed difference."}
{"answers": "W-d HCCs were clinically demonstrated not to be early cancer, because there was no significant difference in disease free survival between the patients with w-d and l-d HCCs.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that well-differentiated small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may not be truly clinically early cancer. Although these tumors have a lower incidence of fibrous capsule formation and do not show significant differences in intrahepatic metastasis or portal vein invasion, they can still have microscopic cancer cell infiltration into the portal tract and minute recurrent foci present at the time of surgery. The lack of significant differences in disease-free survival between the well-differentiated and less-differentiated HCC groups further supports this conclusion."}
{"answers": "The incidence of post-tonsillectomy late haemorrhage in our study population was 1.78%. A statistically significant difference was found between night-time and day-time haemorrhages. Even though no significant distribution of haemorrhages per hour was observed, we underline that we recorded 32 (54.2%) events in 2 periods of the day: from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. and from 6 to 9 a.m.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that a significantly higher proportion (71.2%) of post-tonsillectomy late haemorrhages occurred during the night-time hours compared to the day-time hours (28.8%)."}
{"answers": "Biased estimates of asthma severity may contribute to racially disparate asthma care. Interventions to improve physicians' assessments of asthma severity and patient-physician communication may minimize racial disparities in asthma care.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that black patients were more likely to have their asthma severity underestimated by their physicians compared to white patients. This underestimation was associated with poorer quality asthma care and communication."}
{"answers": "Many factors contribute to the erroneous reporting of hCG results, including (a) the complexity of hCG molecule and confusion of nomenclature on the various forms of hCG; (b) laboratory personnel's lack of awareness of the distinctions of the forms of hCG and failure to recognize the specificity of assays for their measurement; (c) lack of clarity and uniformity in manufacturers' reagent labeling; and (d) most product inserts' lack of information on the specificity of each method to the various forms of hCG.", "prediction_text": "No, based on the findings of this study, there are significant errors in laboratories reporting of hCG results, with some reporting total beta hCG as intact hCG and vice versa. Proper reporting of hCG forms is crucial for accurate diagnosis and monitoring."}
{"answers": "This study has shown that mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons concerning a certain issue is not sufficient to lead to a change in practice.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that mailing a summary of current evidence to surgeons did not significantly reduce the use of prophylactic nasogastric decompression in elective colonic resections. Further interventions may be necessary to change surgical practice."}
{"answers": "These data suggest that either apoptosis is not involved in cell loss in MTS, or a very slow rate of cell demise may have precluded detecting TUNEL-positive neurons dying through apoptosis. Increased Bax expression and activation of caspases support the latter possibility.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study do not provide conclusive evidence for apoptotic cell death in mesial temporal sclerosis, as indicated by the absence of DNA fragmentation using the TUNEL method and lack of typical apoptotic nuclear morphology. Further research is needed to clarify the mechanisms of neuronal death in this condition."}
{"answers": "Golytely was more efficacious than MiraLAX in bowel cleansing, and was independently associated with both bowel prep quality (BBPS \u2265 7) and higher adenoma detection. Golytely should be used as first line for bowel prep for colonoscopy. Studies with larger populations are needed to confirm these results.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that Golytely was associated with a higher adenoma detection rate (26.2%) compared to MiraLAX (16.1%) in this post hoc analysis of a randomized controlled trial. However, the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.091). The study also found that Golytely was more likely to result in a good bowel preparation score (BBPS \u2265 7) compared to MiraLAX (82.5% vs. 67.8%, P = 0.02). On multivariate analysis, Golytely was independently associated with both a good bowel preparation score and adenoma"}
{"answers": "Patient's age (>60 y) and large polyp size (>10 mm) were significant predictive factors for neoplastic GB polyps. GB polyps less than 10 mm in diameter do not require surgical intervention simply because they grow.", "prediction_text": "The growth rate of a gallbladder polyp does not reliably predict a neoplastic polyp. However, older age and a polyp size greater than 10 mm are significant risk factors for neoplastic polyps."}
{"answers": "These data suggest that the R14C KCNQ1 mutation alone is insufficient to cause AF. Rather, we suggest a model in which a \"second hit\", such as an environmental factor like hypertension, which promotes atrial stretch and thereby unmasks an inherited defect in ion channel kinetics (the \"first hit\"), is required for AF to be manifested. Such a model would also account for the age-related increase in AF development.", "prediction_text": "The study identified a stretch-sensitive KCNQ1 mutation (R14C) associated with familial atrial fibrillation. The mutation did not affect channel kinetics at baseline or after activation, but showed altered channel behavior under hypotonic conditions, suggesting a link between genetic and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and explore the clinical implications."}
{"answers": "The real-time PCR approach revealed promising results in pollen identification and quantification, even when analyzing pollen mixes. Future perspectives could concern the development of multiplex real-time PCR for the simultaneous detection of different taxa in the same reaction tube and the application of high-throughput molecular methods.", "prediction_text": "The use of real-time PCR for the identification and quantification of allergenic pollen taxa represents a promising alternative to traditional morphologic identification methods. This approach offers several advantages, including rapidity, accuracy, and automation, which could enhance the efficiency of airborne pollen monitoring networks. Further studies are needed to validate the method for a larger range of pollen taxa and to assess its performance in real-world conditions."}
{"answers": "The Ambu SIB was able to accurately deliver targeted pressures across all three models from preterm to infant. The Neopuff infant resuscitator was unable to deliver the targeted pressures in the infant model developing clinically significant levels of inadvertent PEEP which may pose risk during infant resuscitation.", "prediction_text": "The Ambu self-inflating bag provided adequate and safe manual inflations across a wide range of patient sizes (0.5-10 kg) and clinical states, while the Neopuff T-piece resuscitator was unable to reach set peak inflation pressures and exhibited elevated positive end expiratory pressures in the infant model."}
{"answers": "This longitudinal study found no significant effect of menopausal transition on quality of life among Taiwanese women. The decline in the role limitations due to emotional problems was related to vasomotor symptoms.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant association between menopausal transition and quality of life as measured by the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36, after adjusting for age, education, menopausal status, baseline cognitive score, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale score. However, vasomotor symptoms were found to have a negative impact on role limitation of emotion."}
{"answers": "The incidence of CPM is not increased in IVF/ICSI pregnancies compared with spontaneous conceptions. CPM probably does not account for the adverse perinatal outcomes following IVF/ICSI.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a statistically significant difference in the incidence of confined placental mosaicism between IVF/ICSI pregnancies and spontaneous conceptions. Therefore, it is unclear if confined placental mosaicism is a significant contributor to the poorer perinatal outcomes observed in IVF singletons. Further research is needed to identify the underlying causes of these outcomes."}
{"answers": "For risk stratification in emergency surgical patients, it is essential to measure the APACHE II score before surgical treatment. Longitudinal APACHE II scoring reveals continuous improvement of the score in surviving patients but has no therapeutic relevance in the individual patient.", "prediction_text": "The APACHE II score calculated upon ICU admission may not be an independent marker of physiological impairment in emergency surgical patients, as it is influenced by treatment effects and may lead to bias in evaluating treatment policies and patient comparability. Postoperative monitoring with the APACHE II score is clinically irrelevant."}
{"answers": "The methodologic weaknesses of the studies do not permit acceptance of increased risk of tubal pregnancy or infertility as a consequence of perforation of the appendix, so a causal relationship cannot be supported by the data currently available. Only a well-designed case-control study with unbiased ascertainment of exposure and adjustment for confounding variables will provide a definitive answer.", "prediction_text": "The evidence from the available studies suggests that there may be an increased risk of tubal infertility (4.8, 95% CI 1.5-14.9) and ectopic pregnancy (1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.5) following appendiceal perforation. However, the quality of the studies was limited due to recall bias and inadequate adjustment for confounding variables. Further well-designed studies are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Cancellous bone plays an important role in primary stability of mini-implants in the presence or absence of cortical bone.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the density and structural properties of trabecular bone, as well as the presence of cortical bone, significantly influence the primary stability of miniscrews. Higher trabecular number, thickness, bone volume density, and bone mineral density, as well as greater cortical thickness, are associated with increased primary stability."}
{"answers": "Despite recent efforts, a large proportion of newly confirmed TB patients could not adhere to standard TB treatment, and patients' lost to follow-up was still a serious problem. Poor treatment supervision and heavy financial burden might be the main causes for non-adherence. More needs to be done to enhance treatment supervision policies and financial supports to both health providers and TB patients.", "prediction_text": "The study found that approximately 36.0% of newly confirmed TB patients in western China were non-adherent to their prescribed treatment regimen. Factors associated with non-adherence included lack of direct observation, being supervised by phone calls, and having monthly service expenses above 450 RMB. Patients who were observed by family members and those who received home visits were less likely to be non-adherent."}
{"answers": "While not providing conclusive evidence, this single institution experience suggests that neoadjuvant chemotherapy for Stage IV NPC patients improves both survival and disease control. Recurrence within the irradiated volume was the most prevalent mode of failure and future studies will evaluate regimens to enhance local regional control.", "prediction_text": "Induction chemotherapy improves survival and freedom from relapse in patients with advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), particularly in those with Stage IV disease. However, it does not significantly impact local control or distant failure rates. Patients with UNPC who receive induction chemotherapy and controlled primary and neck disease have a 13% 5-year distant failure rate. The decision to use induction chemotherapy should be individualized based on patient factors and tumor stage."}
{"answers": "There was increased expression of TGF-\u03b21 and VEGF in polyps compared to adjacent normal endometrial tissue. It suggested that these cytokines might play a role in endometrial polyp formation. In addition, there was a significant correlation between steroid receptor expression and VEGF and TGF-\u03b21 expression.", "prediction_text": "Yes, endometrial polyp formation is associated with increased expression of both vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and TGF-\u03b21 in both glandular and stromal cells, particularly in the proliferative phase. The expression of steroid receptors is also correlated with VEGF and TGF-\u03b21 expression."}
{"answers": "Primary eosinophilic esophagitis is characterized by fragile esophageal mucosa that readily tears in response to minor trauma during otherwise uneventful diagnostic endoscopy. This \"cr\u00eape-paper\" sign may alert endoscopists to the presence of the disease when other mucosal alterations are lacking. Dilation is effective for patients with symptoms with minimal morbidity, despite development of disquieting lesions in response to the procedure.", "prediction_text": "The fragility and inelasticity of the esophageal mucosa, also referred to as \"cr\u00eape-paper\" mucosa, may be a pathognomonic endoscopic sign of primary eosinophilic esophagitis. However, further research is needed to confirm this association and establish its diagnostic value."}
{"answers": "Preoperative platelet count is a predictive factor for long-term survival in ESCC, especially in nodal-positive patients. We conclude that 205 (\u00d710(9)/L) may be the optimum cutoff point for platelet count in predicting survival in ESCC patients.", "prediction_text": "A preoperative platelet count \u2264 205 (\u00d7 10(9)/L) is an independent prognostic factor for poorer survival in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, especially in those with positive lymph node involvement."}
{"answers": "From this study we conclude that there is no increase in testicular atrophy in patients less than 13 months.", "prediction_text": "The study found that an intraabdominal location was associated with increased postsurgical testicular atrophy, but age at orchiopexy was not statistically significant after adjusting for location. The highest rate of atrophy was observed in testes orchiopexied between 13-24 months of age."}
{"answers": "The results suggest that a longer duration of treatment may prevent return into mental health care in some groups. However, because of the design of the study, no causal inference can be drawn. Further research, preferably in a RCT, is needed to determine whether the trend towards lower intensity treatments is associated with repeated mental health care use.", "prediction_text": "Shorter duration of psychological treatment for depression is associated with a slightly increased risk of relapse and the need for additional treatment episodes. However, the majority of patients did not return for treatment."}
{"answers": "Written information sheets contribute to the process of informed consent. As patients' recall of information is generally poor, the sheets may also be useful medicolegally, as a permanent record of what was discussed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the use of a written information sheet for informed consent in total hip arthroplasty patients significantly improves their recall of the information given compared to verbal information alone."}
{"answers": "Although theoretically plausible, bicompartmental knee arthroplasty was not superior in knee muscle strength and physical performance at 1 year compared with total knee arthroplasty.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find significant differences in knee muscle strength and physical performance between bicompartmental knee arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty groups at any time point. However, both groups showed improvement in physical performance over time. The age difference between the groups may have influenced the results. Further studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods are needed to definitively determine if bicompartmental knee arthroplasty offers any advantage in muscle strength and physical performance over total knee arthroplasty."}
{"answers": "These results indicate that T-cell deficiency may affect spatial learning performance following toluene exposure.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that T-cell deficiency may protect against the impairment of spatial learning ability following toluene exposure, as indicated by a lack of significant difference in escape latency and probe trial results between nude mice and wild-type mice in the reversal phase. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Histology usually demonstrated moderate to severe inflammation when VLEM were present. VLEM may be a highly specific endoscopic feature of esophagitis in children.", "prediction_text": "The presence of VLEM in children is associated with a high likelihood of eosinophilic esophagitis, which is a specific and sensitive indicator of this condition. However, not all children with VLEM have esophagitis, and other causes should be considered. Further research is needed to determine the specificity and sensitivity of VLEM as an endoscopic marker of esophagitis in children."}
{"answers": "At the gas flows studied, HFNC are not noisier than BCPAP for preterm infants.", "prediction_text": "The study found no significant difference in average noise levels between high flow nasal cannulas and bubble CPAP at the external auditory meatus. However, HFNC were quieter than BCPAP at low frequencies (500 Hz). Noise levels increased with increasing gas flows for both types of devices. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Patients with a history of ACD are at an increased risk of having recurrent preterm birth and cervical shortening in a subsequent pregnancy compared with women with prior preterm birth associated PPROM or PTL.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the clinical presentation of a prior preterm birth, specifically advanced cervical dilatation, is associated with an increased risk of recurrent preterm birth and shorter cervical length in subsequent pregnancies."}
{"answers": "This illustrates that Paget's disease does exist in India and a high index of suspicion is required to clinch the diagnosis.", "prediction_text": "Yes, Paget's disease of bone is present in India, as evidenced by the description of 21 cases in the study, including their demographic, clinical, biochemical, and radiological profiles, and treatment outcomes."}
{"answers": "The results of the present study show that idiopathic incidental misty mesentery appearance has a significant prevalence. Also, the high body mass index of these patients and the growing evidence of obesity-induced inflammatory changes in adipose tissue are suggestive of an association between obesity and misty mesentery appearance on CT.", "prediction_text": "The prevalence of incidentally detected idiopathic misty mesentery on multidetector computed tomography is approximately 7%. Obesity is a common indication for CT examination and is associated with a higher prevalence of this finding. However, the causal relationship between obesity and misty mesentery remains unclear. Further research is needed to determine if obesity is a risk factor or simply a coincidental association."}
{"answers": "Percutaneous ethanol injection without aspiration of ethanol-mixed fluid seems to be the preferable method of treatment of benign cystic thyroid nodules from the perspective of both the physician and the patient.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find a significant difference in the success rates of complete disappearance of the cystic portion of the thyroid nodule between the nonaspiration and aspiration groups. However, the aspiration group had a higher incidence of intracystic hemorrhage and longer procedure time due to additional procedures. Therefore, aspiration of ethanol-mixed fluid after percutaneous ethanol injection for benign cystic thyroid nodules is not advantageous based on the findings of this study."}
{"answers": "The present study, which is based on internationally accepted assessment tools for SLE patients, shows a significant relationship between increased disease activity and reduced physical function. This result emphasizes the importance of optimizing treatment aiming at reducing disease activity.", "prediction_text": "In this study, increased disease activity (BILAG index) was associated with reduced physical function, while greater damage (SDI) was associated with reduced role function due to emotional limitations in SLE patients. Age and disease duration did not show any significant correlation with health status."}
{"answers": "The morbidity associated with desmoid tumors has not been shown to differ, whether they arise after restorative proctocolectomy or ileorectal anastomosis.", "prediction_text": "The clinical course and complications of intra-abdominal desmoid disease were similar in patients with restorative proctocolectomy and ileorectal anastomosis. However, a larger number of patients in the ileorectal anastomosis group required surgery for desmoid tumor complications and had a stoma as a result. The small sample size limits the generalizability of these findings."}
{"answers": "These findings provide evidence for the existence of a high-IQ variant of schizophrenia that is associated with markedly fewer negative symptoms than typical schizophrenia, and lends support to the idea of a psychosis spectrum or continuum over boundaried diagnostic categories.", "prediction_text": "Schizophrenia patients with high pre-morbid intelligence may represent a clinically distinct subtype, as they exhibit lower negative and disorganized symptoms, better global functioning, and greater insight compared to typical schizophrenia patients. However, they also show higher levels of manic symptoms among those with minimal post-onset IQ decline. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and understand the underlying mechanisms."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that hearing loss caused by GM otic drops may be reduced by the inclusion of BM and benzalkonium chloride. Our finding that BM alone was associated with hearing loss suggests that the benzalkonium chloride may be the protective agent in combination otic drops.", "prediction_text": "The use of betamethasone in aminoglycoside-containing ear drops (e.g., otic gentamicin) did not significantly reduce cochlear toxicity in this animal study. The study did show that both betamethasone and gentamicin caused significant hearing loss on their own. However, the study was limited by its small sample size and animal model, and further research is needed to confirm these findings in humans."}
{"answers": "A fetal anatomic survey on follow-up sonograms may identify unanticipated fetal anomalies, especially when the indication is for fetal growth.", "prediction_text": "The findings of this study suggest that fetal anatomic assessment on follow-up antepartum sonograms can identify unanticipated fetal anomalies, particularly renal pyelectasis, and may lead to increased neonatal interventions. However, the small sample size and retrospective design limit the generalizability of these results. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm the clinical utility of fetal anatomic assessment on follow-up antepartum sonograms."}
{"answers": "Patients with BRAF-mutant PTC had a significantly longer PFS than BRAF wild-type when treated with TKIs. However, due to the small number of BRAF-mutant patients, further investigations are required, especially to understand the potential positive effect of BRAF mutations in RAIR TC patients while having a negative prognostic impact in RAI-sensitive PTC patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the identification of specific mutations, particularly BRAF, in radioiodine-refractory thyroid cancers can provide useful information for guiding therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. However, the response to TKIs may also depend on the histological subtype, with PDTC being an independent prognostic factor for poorer progression-free survival."}
{"answers": "The frequency and topographic distribution of LNM are not modified by NACT, and clinical non-responders showed more involved LNs. A systemic and extensive lymphadenectomy should be performed in patients treated with NACT plus surgery regardless of the response to NACT.", "prediction_text": "Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) can reduce the incidence of lymph node metastasis in cervical cancer patients, but the topographical distribution patterns of lymph node metastasis may not be significantly altered. Factors such as clinical response, deep stromal invasion, parametrial invasion, lymph vascular invasion, number of lymph nodes involved, tumor histology, and positive vaginal margin are independent prognostic factors for disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS) in node-positive patients treated with NACT plus radical surgery."}
{"answers": "A prior benign prostate biopsy may be independently associated with more favorable surgical and biochemical outcomes after prostatectomy. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings.", "prediction_text": "Prior benign prostate biopsy is associated with more favorable pathologic features and improved biochemical disease-free survival, especially for those with more aggressive disease, in patients undergoing radical perineal prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer."}
{"answers": "This clinical trial evaluated the possible reduction in intervention-related myocardial damage that was attributable to remote postischemic conditioning.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that remote ischemic postconditioning may reduce myocardial lesions associated with PCI, but the protective effect may be less pronounced in diabetic patients. However, the study did not find a significant difference in the primary outcome variable (maximum increase in troponin in the first 24 hours) between the remote postischemic conditioning and placebo groups. The secondary outcome variable (readmission due to heart failure or cardiovascular mortality after 1 year of follow-up) was also not significantly different between the two groups. Further studies with larger populations and longer follow-up periods are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "These results indicate that prophylactic treatment with edaravone prevents I/R-induced ovarian damage during pneumoperitoneum in an experimental rat model.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the results of this study suggest that edaravone offers protection against ischemia/reperfusion-induced ovarian damage in rats, as evidenced by a reduction in follicular degeneration and edema, decreased caspase-3 expression, and attenuation of oxidative stress markers."}
{"answers": "Sonography has no place in the diagnosis of undescended testis.", "prediction_text": "Ultrasonography has limited accuracy in the diagnosis of undescended testes, particularly in identifying retractile testes and abdominal testes. It should not be relied upon as the sole diagnostic tool and clinical examination remains the gold standard."}
{"answers": "Mammographic density is not associated with an increased need for re-excision or resection of unnecessary margins at initial BCS.", "prediction_text": "The data suggests that there is a trend towards a higher re-excision rate in patients with denser breasts, but this association was not significant in the multivariate analysis. The rate of unnecessary margins did not differ by breast density. However, the re-excision rate was significantly higher in patients with DCIS and lower in those with resection of additional margins."}
{"answers": "Septal suturing after septoplasty offers the following advantages: elimination of discomfort for the patients, minimal complications, the outcome is almost the same as with nasal packing, and finally the hospital stay is less than with nasal packing. Therefore, suturing of the nasal septum after septoplasty should be a preferred alternative to nasal packing.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, suturing of the nasal septum after septoplasty is associated with a lower risk of minor oozing, bleeding, septal hematoma, and septal perforation compared to nasal packing. However, the incidence of postoperative adhesions and remnant deviated nasal septum is similar in both groups. The operating time is slightly longer in the suturing group. These results suggest that suturing may be a more effective alternative to nasal packing in terms of reducing complications. However, further studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "The present study does not support the recommendation of ultrasound as a conclusive diagnostic tool for internal derangements of the temporomandibular joint.", "prediction_text": "The findings of this study suggest that while the presence of articular sounds and physical signs may be insufficient for detecting disk displacement, high-resolution ultrasound can still provide valuable information. However, its sensitivity is lower compared to magnetic resonance imaging. Further research is needed to improve ultrasound techniques and access to fully assess its role in the diagnosis of internal derangement of the temporomandibular joint."}
{"answers": "Our results showed that the serum leptin level has no prognostic indications in advanced lung cancer patients. Leptin is decreased in lung cancer, and there is lack of correlation with tumour\u2011related factors including prognosis. Therefore, leptin is not a useful clinical marker in lung cancer (Tab. 2, Fig. 2, Ref. 22).", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant association between serum leptin levels and overall survival in advanced lung cancer patients. However, lower leptin levels were observed in lung cancer patients compared to healthy controls, and there was a correlation between leptin levels and BMI in lung cancer patients. Further research is needed to determine the role of leptin in lung cancer."}
{"answers": "We found no evidence of serovar specific immunity in our population. It remains possible that populations with a higher prevalence of gonorrhoea and more frequent infections may have a quantitatively greater immune response.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study do not support the existence of serovar-specific immunity to Neisseria gonorrhoeae in preventing reinfection."}
{"answers": "BPPV is associated with positive viral serology, particularly during certain months of the year, mainly in spring and autumn. Viral infection might promote BPPV attacks due to the development of vestibulopathy or induce secondary BPPV via viral infection-related neurolabyrinthitis.", "prediction_text": "The findings suggest that certain viral infections, including HSV1, Herpes zoster, adenovirus, and CMV, may be associated with an increased risk of developing benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). The seasonal variation in viral activity may also play a role. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and establish a causal relationship."}
{"answers": "We found increased post-ictal serum cytokine levels in patients with several epilepsy syndromes.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that certain cytokines, such as IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha, may be involved in epilepsy, with higher levels detected in patients with epilepsy or new onset seizures compared to healthy controls. However, the exact role of these cytokines in the pathophysiology of epilepsy remains unclear and further research is needed. Additionally, cytokine levels decreased during the seizure-free period, suggesting a potential role in the acute phase of seizures."}
{"answers": "Neuromedin U reduces insulin and increases somatostatin secretion. Blockade of somatostatin action abolishes the inhibition of insulin secretion by NmU. The results of the study suggest that somatostatin mediates the inhibitory action of NmU on insulin secretion.", "prediction_text": "Yes, somatostatin plays a role in mediating the insulinostatic effects of Neuromedin U in the rat pancreas by stimulating somatostatin secretion and inhibiting insulin secretion."}
{"answers": "Patients with fewer or anterior sutures have shorter OR times. However, 30-day readmission, band-related reoperation, and postoperative weight loss were unaffected by number or location of suture. The technical aspects of HHR did not appear to be associated with readmission or reoperation, and therefore a standardized approach may not be necessary.", "prediction_text": "The number and location of sutures used for hiatal hernia repair during laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding do not significantly affect length of stay, 30-day readmission, band-related reoperation, or postoperative BMI/%EWL. However, patients with fewer sutures had a shorter operating room time, and those with anterior suture placement had a shorter operating room time and shorter length of stay. No significant difference in reoperation rates was observed between anterior, posterior, and both suture placements."}
{"answers": "Survivors of lobar ICH with atrial fibrillation should not be offered long-term anticoagulation. Similarly, most patients with deep hemispheric ICH and atrial fibrillation should not receive anticoagulant therapy. However, patients with deep hemispheric ICH at particularly high risk for thromboembolic stroke or low risk of ICH recurrence might benefit from long-term anticoagulation.", "prediction_text": "The decision to anticoagulate a patient with a history of intracerebral hemorrhage and nonvalvular atrial fibrillation should be individualized based on the location of the previous hemorrhage. For lobar hemorrhages, withholding anticoagulation is preferred, while for deep hemispheric hemorrhages, the risk-benefit balance is less clear and anticoagulation may be considered if the risk of thromboembolic stroke is high. A decision-analysis model can be used to help guide the decision-making process."}
{"answers": "This study showed that FDG is not a good surrogate tracer for tumor hypoxia under either ambient or hypoxic conditions. Only specific hypoxia tracers should be used to measure tumor hypoxia.", "prediction_text": "The results of this study suggest that while there is some overlap in the distribution of (14)C-EF3 and (18)F-FDG in tumors under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions, the similarity between the two tracers decreases under hypoxic conditions. However, the study did not find a significant increase in (18)F-FDG uptake under hypoxic conditions compared to normoxic conditions. Therefore, the use of (18)F-FDG as a surrogate tracer to measure tumor hypoxia is not conclusively supported by the findings of this study. Further research is needed to determine the utility of (18"}
{"answers": "A task-specific intervention designed to improve gait speed may potentially provide secondary benefits by positively impacting depression, mobility and social participation for people post stroke.", "prediction_text": "The study found that treadmill training led to significant improvements in depression, mobility, and social participation in individuals in the chronic stage of recovery from stroke. However, there was no significant difference between the treadmill training group and the control group for any dependent measure."}
{"answers": "Orthostatic myoclonus is often underdiagnosed and can be considered a possible cause of unsteadiness in subjects with neurodegenerative diseases. Electromyography surface recording is thereby an aid for investigating unsteadiness of unknown origin.", "prediction_text": "Orthostatic myoclonus is a common cause of unsteadiness and gait impairment, particularly in patients with neurodegenerative disorders. Its diagnosis is based on the observation of non-rhythmic bursts during orthostatism, and it may be underrecognized due to its subtle clinical presentation. Further research is needed to better understand its underlying mechanisms and the most effective treatment approaches."}
{"answers": "Severely injured patients treated at a level III center had a higher mortality rate than those treated at a level I center. Most problems identified occurred in the emergency department and were related to delays in care provision. This research highlights the importance of efficient prehospital, in-hospital, and regional trauma systems, performance monitoring, peer review, and adherence to protocols and guidelines.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the level of trauma center providing treatment for severely injured trauma patients in this Australian health service was associated with a significantly higher risk of mortality for those admitted to a level III trauma center compared to a level I trauma center. This difference was not explained by age, sex, ISS, or prehospital time. The peer review of deaths at the level III center identified issues with care delivery, including technical errors, delays in decision making, and errors of judgement."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that very few genes, which change their expression level during the WOI, show a quantitative homogeneous expression in endometrially-receptive patients. In conclusion, in this study only six genes showed a homogeneous expression, and are probably involved in embryo implantation mechanisms.", "prediction_text": "The present study identified six genes (VEGFA, PLA2G2A, ALPL, LIF, NNMT, and STC1) with a statistically uniform expression among women who became pregnant after a subsequent ICSI cycle. However, considerable differences in expression levels were observed for the other genes analyzed. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to understand the role of these genes in the implantation process."}
{"answers": "While SSA would be the first region to experience the huge benefits of implementing the \"test and treat\" policy of the WHO, the region is not yet prepared to manage the consequential increased burden of ART-related toxic and metabolic complications. Urgent measures should be taken to fill the lacunae if SSA is not to become over-burdened by the consequences of the \"test and treat\" policy.", "prediction_text": "Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) faces significant challenges in coping with the anticipated increase in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-related adverse effects due to the widespread implementation of the \"test and treat\" policy. The region's weak health systems, inadequate resources, and high prevalence of ART-related comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease, lipodystrophy, and diabetes, make it particularly vulnerable. Data on the incidence and predictive factors of these conditions in SSA are limited, making it difficult to prepare an adequate response plan. Addressing these challenges will require substantial investment in healthcare infrastructure, education, and research."}
{"answers": "In summary we believe sudden onset chest wall rigidity may be a significant and previously unreported factor leading to an increased mortality, from illicit IV fentanyl use. Fentanyl and norfentanyl ratios and concentrations suggest a more rapid onset of death given the finding of fentanyl without norfentanyl in many of the fatalities. Chest wall rigidity may help explain the cause of death in these instances, in contrast to the typical opioid-related overdose deaths. Intravenous heroin users should be educated regarding this potentially fatal complication given the increasingly common substitution and combination with heroin of fentanyl.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the findings from this study suggest that acute chest wall rigidity may be a contributing factor in the rapid deaths observed from illicit fentanyl abuse. The lack of detectable norfentanyl in many cases supports this hypothesis. However, it is important to note that other factors, such as a dose-related rapid onset of respiratory arrest, may also play a role. It is crucial for the drug abuse community to be made aware of this potential complication."}
{"answers": "There appears to be no benefit in metformin co-treatment before and during IVF in women with PCO without any other features of PCOS. Clinical Trials.gov: NCT01046032.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in live birth rates or severe OHSS rates between women with PCO and no other features of PCOS who received metformin co-treatment and those who received placebo during IVF. Therefore, metformin co-treatment may not be beneficial for this group of women. Further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "The study suggests that ventilating an adult patient is possible with a smaller, pediatric-sized BVM. The tidal volumes recorded with the pediatric BVM were more consistent with lung-protective ventilation volumes.", "prediction_text": "EMS providers were able to provide tidal volumes within the recommended range when using a pediatric-sized BVM in simulated adult-sized patients, and the pediatric BVM provided lower median tidal volumes compared to the adult BVM. However, more studies with larger populations are needed to confirm these findings in real-life situations."}
{"answers": "Our results suggest that colonoscopy does not affect the management of patients with acute diverticulitis nor alter the outcome. The current practice of a routine colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis, diagnosed by typical clinical symptoms and CT needs to be reevaluated.", "prediction_text": "Colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis does not significantly impact management, as no colonic malignancies were detected and only one advanced adenoma was found in 32% of patients. However, further studies with larger populations are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Pretreatment ECG is of limited value for patients with an unremarkable cardiovascular history and a normal heart rate and blood pressure. Hypotension may occur during treatment.", "prediction_text": "While consensus guidelines recommend cardiovascular evaluation for patients with infantile hemangiomas prior to and during beta-blocker therapy, this study suggests that while some cardiovascular evaluations, such as ECG, may be normal, there is still a low risk of cardiovascular side effects and complications. Therefore, it is recommended that cardiovascular evaluations be performed prior to initiating beta-blocker therapy for patients with IH. However, the small patient cohort in this study is a limitation and larger studies are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is a promising option for lifelong treatment of type 2 diabetes. It has the potential to improve or cure a selected spectrum of type 1 diabetes when performed early in the disease. Further animal model studies or randomized controlled trials are needed to support our conclusion.", "prediction_text": "Roux-en-Y gastric bypass has shown promising results in managing type 2 diabetes and is being explored as a potential treatment option for type 1 diabetes. However, more research is needed to determine its long-term efficacy and safety as a lifelong solution for diabetes mellitus."}
{"answers": "Collectively, results suggest that behavioral adaptation to ESC is likely in certain drivers; however, its proven effectiveness in reducing the likelihood of being involved in a serious crash probably outweighs any potential increases in unsafe driving. To fully benefit from ESC, vehicle manufacturers are encouraged to market ESC-equipped vehicles in a realistic, safe manner. Driver training and safety organizations are also encouraged to provide balanced educational information about ESC to their members.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that some drivers who use ESC may exhibit behavioral adaptation or overreliance on the technology, which could impact its overall effectiveness. However, the majority of ESC users reported increased confidence in the safety of their vehicle and a belief that it had made driving safer. Further research is needed to fully understand the potential impact of ESC on driving behavior and its long-term effects on collision reduction."}
{"answers": "The results of the study demonstrate that when clinical supervision uses best practice principles, it can provide professional support for allied health workers, even during times of rapid organisational change.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, clinical supervision was perceived to be effective by allied health professionals, and the length, frequency, and completion of clinical supervision agreements were significant contributors to its effectiveness. Therefore, clinical supervision can be an essential component in supporting and developing the allied health workforce in the current healthcare landscape."}
{"answers": "Both 'economic/employment' and 'social/welfare' dimensions of social exclusion significantly influence suicide mortality among males. The influence of 'economic/employment' and 'social/welfare' dimensions of social exclusion on female suicide mortality is controversial. Social exclusion might be considered as a risk factor for suicide mortality in Europe.", "prediction_text": "Yes, both the 'economic/employment' and 'social/welfare' dimensions of social exclusion have a significant negative influence on suicide mortality in Europe for both males and females. However, the influence of the 'social/welfare' dimension is stronger for females."}
{"answers": "While ultrasound examination is inexpensive and easily done, it is not accurate enough for staging small penile cancers located at the glans penis. However, for larger tumors ultrasound can be a useful addition to physical examination by delineating reliably the anatomic relations of the tumor to structures such as the tunica albuginea, corpus cavernosum, and urethra.", "prediction_text": "Ultrasound examination can provide valuable information in the assessment of squamous cell carcinoma of the penis, particularly in determining invasion into the tunica albuginea of the corpus cavernosum. However, its ability to accurately assess invasion into the corpus spongiosum and measure maximum tumor thickness is limited. Ultrasound should be considered as an adjunct to other imaging modalities and histopathologic examination in the clinical staging of this disease."}
{"answers": "This study confirms that a large percentage of patients use metered-dose inhalers improperly. It also demonstrates a significant lack of understanding by health care providers of the proper use of metered-dose inhalers. Furthermore, this study supports the use of respiratory care practitioners in the outpatient setting, since they were the most proficient among all the health care providers in the proper use of metered-dose inhalers.", "prediction_text": "The results of this study suggest that both health care providers and patients may have a poor understanding of the proper use of metered-dose inhalers. Health care providers, including house staff and nurses, showed less proficiency in the use of metered-dose inhalers compared to respiratory care practitioners. Education and training programs for health care providers and patients on the correct use of metered-dose inhalers are necessary to improve outcomes in asthma management."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrated that the regional or global apex of a given curve is the most rotated level in only a minority of the curves. The most rotated level may be as far as two levels from the global apex and one level from the regional apex.", "prediction_text": "In adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, the transverse apex (most rotated vertebra or disc) and coronal apex (regional or global) do not always coincide, and the difference can extend up to two levels."}
{"answers": "Generalization of the RCT sample was supported, because only 7.8% of Phenomenology subjects did not fit the RCT criteria. Nevertheless, because the RCT subjects were more severely ill, it is unclear if treatment findings from the RCT will be applicable to children with less severe mania.", "prediction_text": "The TEAM RCT sample and the Phenomenology sample were similar in demographics and other clinical characteristics, but the TEAM sample had a higher prevalence of mania symptoms, ultradian rapid cycling, psychosis, and suicidality. The representativeness of the TEAM sample for child bipolar I disorder needs to be further evaluated in larger and more diverse populations."}
{"answers": "Experts across Europe asserted the right to culturally sensitive health care for all immigrants. There is a broad consensus among experts about the major principles of good practice that need to be implemented across Europe. However, there also is some disagreement both within and between countries on specific issues that require further research and debate.", "prediction_text": "While there is a broad European consensus on many factors characterizing good practice in health care for immigrants, there are still disagreements within and between countries on specific issues, such as prioritizing cultural differences and consistent governance of health care services."}
{"answers": "Biochemical analysis of injured cervical intervertebral disks reveals the presence of inflammatory markers such as MCP, fragments of structural matrix proteins such as FAC, and a correlation with pH. Further evaluation of the FAC as a potential diagnostic biomarker or therapeutic target is warranted in the cervical spine.", "prediction_text": "The fibronectin-aggrecan complex was present in the lavage fluid of patients undergoing cervical diskectomy for radiculopathy caused by disk herniation. Additionally, there was a statistically significant correlation between MCP and the fibronectin-aggrecan complex, as well as between the fibronectin-aggrecan complex and pH. However, the study was small and further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Affect-regulated exercise to feel 'good' can be used in a training programme to regulate exercise intensity. This approach led to a 19% increase in time to reach ventilatory threshold, which is indicative of improved fitness.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that affect-regulated exercise training, where individuals exercise at an intensity that makes them feel good, can lead to improved fitness as indicated by an increase in time to reach ventilatory threshold. However, the exercise intensities used were in the lower range of recommended guidelines for cardiovascular health. Further research is needed to determine if this type of training can lead to long-term physical health gains and if it can benefit active individuals as well."}
{"answers": "In Southern Italy, hepatitis G virus infection is widespread among patients with chronic hepatitis, independently of parenteral risk factors. Its frequency in subjects with cryptogenic liver disease parallels that observed in hepatitis C virus chronic liver disease, thus ruling out an aetiologic role of hepatitis G virus. TT virus infection is uncommon in patients with cryptogenic or hepatitis C virus-related liver disease who do not have a history of parenteral exposure.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in the rate of infection with hepatitis G virus or TT virus between patients with cryptogenic chronic liver disease and those with hepatitis C virus-related chronic liver disease. However, a higher prevalence of severe liver damage was observed in the hepatitis C virus-infected group. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to fully understand the role of these viruses in cryptogenic chronic liver disease."}
{"answers": "Our findings suggest that somatic complaints may represent one, but not necessarily the most important, risk factor for the subsequent development of depressive symptoms in women in nonclinical populations. The results also highlight the importance of including social variables in studies on women's depression as well as conducting additional research to further examine predictors of depressive symptoms in men.", "prediction_text": "In this prospective study, somatic complaints, as measured by the SCL-90-R somatization subscale, predicted subsequent symptoms of depression, as measured by the CES-D scale, in women, but were a less powerful predictor than income and age. The relationship between somatic complaints and depression was stronger for women than men. However, more research is needed to fully understand the nature of this relationship."}
{"answers": "Peak inspiratory pressure, PEEP, and ventilation index values could distinguish survivors from nonsurvivors by day 3. This may assist in early application of supportive nonconventional therapies in children with malignancy and ARDS.", "prediction_text": "Early respiratory predictors of mortality in children with hemato-oncology malignancy and ARDS include peak inspiratory pressure, positive end-expiratory pressure, and ventilation index values. From day 8, efficiency of oxygenation, as determined by PaO2/FIO2 and P(A-a)O2, is a significant predictor of outcome. Sepsis syndrome is also a common factor."}
{"answers": "In this small study serum inhibin concentrations higher than those found in the early follicular phase one to two weeks after evacuation of a hydatidiform mole seemed to be specific for persistent trophoblastic disease. Further data are needed to confirm these promising results.", "prediction_text": "Elevated inhibin concentrations in both serum and tissue are strongly associated with hydatidiform mole. After evacuation of the mole, serum inhibin levels decrease to normal levels and none of the patients with undetectable inhibin levels developed persistent trophoblastic disease. Inhibin may serve as a useful marker for the diagnosis and monitoring of hydatidiform mole. However, further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "The integration of whole-lesion dynamic data tends to improve specificity. However, no statistical significance backs up this finding.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that while the most suspect curve and curve-type distribution percentage have diagnostic accuracy in the range of 76.1-80.4% for MRM, the combined dynamic data had the highest diagnostic accuracy (84.3 +/- 4.2%). However, the differences did not achieve statistical significance. Therefore, the use of whole lesion time curve distribution analysis in CAD for MRM may provide additional diagnostic information, but further research is needed to confirm its clinical utility and significance."}
{"answers": "The seemingly exaggerated traditional fear of anaphylaxis seems to discourage surgeons from more widely adopting minimal access techniques for the treatment of hydatid cyst.", "prediction_text": "Yes, fear of anaphylaxis and dissemination is a significant reason why many surgeons in northern Jordan do not adopt percutaneous or laparoscopic techniques for the treatment of liver hydatid cysts."}
{"answers": "Grandmultiparous women had increased maternal and neonatal morbidity, and neonatal mortality even after controlling for confounders, suggesting a need for closer observation than regular multiparous patients during labor and delivery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, grandmultiparity is an independent risk factor for various adverse perinatal outcomes, including abruptio placentae, preterm delivery, fetal macrosomia, neonatal death, postpartum hemorrhage, and blood transfusion. These risks were significant even after controlling for potential confounding factors."}
{"answers": "No single data source is likely to provide a complete health profile for an individual. For women with depression in pregnancy and dispensed antidepressants, the hospital admission data do not adequately capture all cases.", "prediction_text": "The study found that there is a significant under-ascertainment of major depression in pregnancy using hospital admission data compared to dispensing claims data. The true prevalence of major depression in pregnancy is likely to be higher than the reported 4.6% based on dispensing records alone. The study suggests that a combination of both datasets may provide a more accurate estimate of the prevalence of major depression in pregnancy. However, the study also highlights the limitations of using routinely collected health datasets for health outcomes research and the importance of investigating the differences in ascertainment between different datasets."}
{"answers": "These data suggest a pattern of diagnostic stability over time for manic and mixed episodes in patients with bipolar disorder. Careful prospective studies of this issue are needed.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that the manic/mixed episode distinction in bipolar disorder is a stable feature over time. The observed distribution of manic and mixed episodes was significantly different from what would be expected by chance."}
{"answers": "The analyses show that structural characteristics of a practice are not associated with uptake of a new IT facility, but that its use may be influenced by post-graduate education in the relevant clinical condition. For this diabetes system at least, practice nurse use was critical in spreading uptake beyond initial GP enthusiasts and for sustained and rising use in subsequent years.", "prediction_text": "The number of diabetes-educated staff in a general practice was the only structural characteristic significantly associated with increased use of an IT innovation in primary care."}
{"answers": "GAPS, a simple clinical score, is a better predictor of admission than triage nurses, unless the nurse is sure about the outcome, in which case their clinical judgement should be respected.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that while nurses and the objective GAPS score have similar accuracy in predicting admission, the GAPS score outperforms nurses in calibration, discrimination, and overall accuracy in the majority of cases. However, when clinical certainty is high among nurses, their predictions are more accurate. Combining the use of GAPS with nurse's clinical judgment may lead to better performance."}
{"answers": "Our data showed no difference in 25(OH) D levels between normal children and those with CD when adjusted for body mass index.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find a significant difference in vitamin D levels between prepubertal children with celiac disease and those without the condition. However, obese children with celiac disease had lower vitamin D levels compared to non-obese children without celiac disease. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and determine the underlying causes."}
{"answers": "Granulomatous myelotoxicity and enteritis developed in a 21 year old female within 3 weeks of initiating sulfasalazine for rheumatoid arthritis. Following a short course of corticosteroids, the patient had resolution of her cholestatic hepatitis, rash, eosinophilia, and gastrointestinal symptoms with no residual manifestations at 7 months follow-up. Although severe reactions to sulfasalazine are rare and unpredictable, practicing physicians should be aware of unusual clinical presentations of toxicity when prescribing sulfasalazine.", "prediction_text": "The patient described in the paper is a 21-year old female with rheumatoid arthritis who experienced a severe systemic reaction to sulfasalazine, which included eosinophilia, granulomatous enteritis, myelotoxicity, cholestatic hepatitis, and seizures. This reaction is not specific to Crohn's disease, as the patient has rheumatoid arthritis. The paper does not mention Crohn's disease as a diagnosis for this patient."}
{"answers": "Healthy lifestyles lead to an increase in the utilization of preventive health services. However, there is not much significantly reducing the number of outpatient visits in people with health behaviors. Specifically, people with regular exercise habits and who take their blood pressure measurement regularly have an increased number of outpatient visits. It is suggested that more available and accessible health consultation services be provided to inculcate in the general public the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that certain health behaviors, such as exercise habits, dietary habits, regular blood pressure measurement, and drinking habits, are significantly associated with the utilization of healthcare resources, including the number of outpatient visits and health examinations. However, the study does not directly answer whether healthier lifestyles lead to less utilization of healthcare resources, but rather identifies correlations between the two. Further research is needed to establish a causal relationship."}
{"answers": "Parental restriction of R-rated movie viewing is associated with both lower adolescent smoking susceptibility and lower smoking rates.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study provides evidence that parental restriction of R-rated movie viewing is associated with a lower risk of adolescent smoking susceptibility. The results suggest that partial or no restriction increases the likelihood of smoking susceptibility, even after controlling for demographic factors, family, and friend smoking."}
{"answers": "Having a usual physician can be an effective tool in improving access to care for low-income populations, although it is most effective when combined with insurance coverage. However, the effectiveness of managed care in linking more low-income persons to a medical home is uncertain, and may have unintended consequences for uninsured persons.", "prediction_text": "The study found that high managed care penetration in a community is associated with a lower likelihood of having a usual source of care for uninsured persons compared to low penetration areas. The impact of managed care on the likelihood of having a usual source of care is marginal for privately insured and Medicaid beneficiaries. However, having a usual physician does reduce unmet medical needs for the insured, but less so for the uninsured."}
{"answers": "Locally 1.0% ropivacaine administration significantly relieves the pain of pediatric tonsillectomy and, it is a safe and effective method. High concentrations of ropivaciane may produce clinically significant pain relief. It is more effective to reduce of post-operative analgesic requirement after first hour.", "prediction_text": "Topical application of ropivacaine hydrochloride in the tonsillar fossae after tonsillectomy resulted in significant pain relief beyond the first hour, but did not reduce morbidity as evidenced by nausea, fever, vomiting, odor, bleeding, otalgia, and trismus. No complications or systemic side effects were reported."}
{"answers": "Minimally invasive mitral valve repair using neochords provided a high rate of repair, reproducible results in a routine cardiac surgery setting and stable repair during follow-up. This has become our preferred technique for mitral valve surgery.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that minimally invasive mitral valve repair using artificial chords is a reproducible and effective approach, with a high repair rate, low recurrent mitral regurgitation, and no reported de-insertion or rupture of neochords. However, further studies with larger populations and longer follow-up are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Comparisons of absolute EOA values grouped by the manufacturers' valve sizes are misleading because of specific differences in geometric dimensions. The EOA:patient aortic annulus area ratio provides a new hemodynamic index which may facilitate objective comparisons between different valve types.", "prediction_text": "The effective orifice area (EOA) to patient aortic annulus area ratio is a useful method to compare the hemodynamic performance of different bioprostheses, as it adjusts for variables such as patient anatomy and valve dimensions. However, in this study, there was no significant difference in EOA/patient aortic annulus area ratio between the Medtronic Mosaic and Edwards Perimount bioprostheses."}
{"answers": "Women compared to men often delay seeking treatment for an AMI, which further increases their risks. Our findings suggest specific characteristics that can serve as a profile to those African Americans most likely to delay seeking treatment for AMI.", "prediction_text": "The study found that women had longer prehospital delays than men, but the difference was not statistically significant. Single women and women who were alone when symptoms began delayed longer than single men and women with someone. Women who received advice to seek help or call 911 had shorter delays than those who were not advised. Men at home delayed longer than men who experienced symptoms outside the home, and men with emergency room insurance delayed longer than those without it. However, men who took an ambulance to the hospital had shorter delay times than those who took other means of transportation. The study did not specifically address why these gender differences occurred."}
{"answers": "A reduced alveolar macrophage phagocytic host response to apoptotic cells or NTHi may contribute to neutrophilic inflammation and NTHi colonization in both PBB and bronchiectasis. Whether this mechanism also contributes to the progression of PBB to bronchiectasis remains unknown.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study provides evidence that children with recurrent protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) have impaired alveolar macrophage phagocytic function, which is a common feature of bronchiectasis. The reduced phagocytic capacity of alveolar macrophages in children with PBB may contribute to the development of bronchiectasis. The study also found that children with bronchiectasis had lower phagocytic capacity and efferocytosis, as well as reduced mannose receptor expression and increased IL-1\u03b2 levels compared to control subjects. These findings suggest that phagocytic dysfunction may play a role in the pathogenesis of"}
{"answers": "Cervical physical therapy can have a positive effect on subjective tinnitus complaints in patients with a combination of tinnitus and neck complaints. Larger studies, using more responsive outcome measures, are however necessary to prove this effect.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that multi-modal cervical physical therapy can lead to substantial improvement in tinnitus symptoms in some patients with cervicogenic somatic tinnitus, although the effect is not sustained in all cases. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and determine the optimal treatment protocol."}
{"answers": "Because workers may have an elevated relative aerobic workload for several hours each working day, this relationship may elucidate a mechanism behind the increased risk for cardiovascular disease among workers exposed to high levels of occupational physical activity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that a 1% increase in mean relative aerobic workload was associated with a significant increase in both systolic and diastolic ambulatory blood pressure."}
{"answers": "Our investigation did not undoubtedly prove that significant changes of fetal biometric parameters occurred in the last three decades. It is possible that secular growth acceleration does not exist in prenatal period but also the observed time period could have been short for this phenomenon to manifest.", "prediction_text": "Based on the data presented in the study, there is no evidence to support the existence of secular growth acceleration during fetal life for the biometric parameters of biparietal diameter, fetal length, and abdominal circumference."}
{"answers": "Consistent with prior studies, we found an inverse relationship between obesity and serum prostate specific antigen. However, the magnitude of the difference was small. Thus, adjusting prostate specific antigen for body mass index does not appear warranted.", "prediction_text": "The results of this study suggest that there is no significant association between body mass index and prostate specific antigen after adjusting for age in men without prostate cancer. Therefore, there is no need to adjust prostate specific antigen for body mass index. However, further studies with larger populations are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Emergency laparotomy carries a high rate of mortality, especially in those over the age of 70 years, and more needs to be done to improve outcomes, particularly in this group. This could involve increasing acute surgical care manpower, early recognition of patients requiring emergency surgery, development of clear management protocols for such patients or perhaps even considering centralisation of emergency surgical services to specialist centres with multidisciplinary teams involving emergency surgeons and care of the elderly physicians in hospital and related community outreach services for post-discharge care.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the high 30-day and 1-year mortality rates in emergency laparotomies, particularly in older adults, highlight the need for prospective data collection, improvement of care, and the establishment of best practices in this area."}
{"answers": "[corrected] This observation is exceptional in many aspects: very early age of onset of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, no immune deficit, association with a rare congenital neurological syndrome. We discuss the possible link between this entity and the occurrence of tuberculosis.", "prediction_text": "The occurrence of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis in a child with a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome is a rare event. While a causative link between the two is not definitively established in this case report, further research is warranted to explore potential associations between this syndrome and increased susceptibility to tuberculosis."}
{"answers": "The signal intensity on DWI showed no significant difference in the development of vascularization.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study do not support the use of diffusion-weighted imaging as a significant indicator of the development of vascularization in hypovascular hepatocellular lesions. Further research is needed to confirm these results."}
{"answers": "General practitioners should consider using patients' first names more often, particularly with younger patients.", "prediction_text": "The majority of patients are comfortable with being addressed by their first names by their doctors, but the reverse is not the case. The decision to use first names should be based on individual patient preferences and comfort levels."}
{"answers": "Patients after ART treatment suffer from higher C-section rates during their stage of delivery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that primiparae who conceived through ART had higher rates of both elective and emergency C-sections compared to those who conceived spontaneously. The risk was higher for fresh transferred embryos and slow freezing methods. Additionally, all ART groups had an increased risk of significant perinatal bleeding."}
{"answers": "Trauma patients have a significant complication rate related to anticoagulation therapy, and predicting which patients will develop a complication remains unclear. Prospective studies are needed to determine which treatment regimen, if any, is appropriate to safely anticoagulate this high risk population.", "prediction_text": "The use of therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients is associated with a significant risk of complications, including bleeding and hemorrhage. Factors such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, UH use, and lower initial platelet count have been identified as independent predictors of complications. However, the most common indication for anticoagulation was deep venous thrombosis. The overall complication rate was 21%, with 4% of patients dying due to hemorrhage attributed to anticoagulation. Therefore, the safety of therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients should be carefully considered and individualized based on patient factors and indications."}
{"answers": "A significant difference in dental health between recruits to each Service does exist and is a likely to be a reflection of the sociodemographic background from which they are drawn.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant difference in the dental health of new recruits to the British Armed Forces, with Army recruits having a greater prevalence of dental decay and greater treatment resource need compared to Royal Navy and Royal Air Force recruits. Additionally, a higher percentage of Army recruits came from more deprived socioeconomic backgrounds."}
{"answers": "In light of the large sample size and prior pilot testing of presented images, results suggest that episodic migraineurs do not differentially attend to headache-related facial stimuli. Given modest evidence of attentional biases among chronic headache samples, these findings suggest potential differences in attentional processing between chronic and episodic headache subforms.", "prediction_text": "The results of this study did not find any evidence of selective attention towards headache-related visual stimuli in episodic migraineurs compared to non-migraine controls."}
{"answers": "Under the conditions of this study, preclerkship (year 2) CPEs strongly predicted medical students at risk for failing a senior CPE. This finding opens the opportunity for remediation of deficits prior to or during clerkships.", "prediction_text": "Yes, students with lower scores on preclerkship clinical performance examinations are at a higher risk for failing a senior clinical performance examination. However, USMLE Step 1 scores also correlate with performance on the senior CPE, but their predictive values are weaker compared to preclerkship examinations."}
{"answers": "Our results suggest that people do not attach a simple fixed premium to \"safety-related\" interventions but that preferences depend more subtly on context. The use of the results of such public preference surveys to directly inform policy would therefore be premature.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the public places a higher value on health care interventions aimed at preventing harms caused within the health care system, such as hospital-acquired infections, compared to interventions related to individual lifestyle choices or injuries. However, the study also suggests that interventions to prevent injuries to health care staff are valued less than those related to genetic disorders. The findings highlight the importance of considering the context and causation of health interventions when evaluating their cost-effectiveness and prioritizing resource allocation."}
{"answers": "Minimising the radiation dose to one of the parotid glands with the help of IMRT in patients with advanced head and neck cancers can prevent xerostomia in most patients and parotid scintigraphy is a useful method of documenting xerostomia.", "prediction_text": "In this study, sparing one parotid gland during IMRT for head and neck cancers resulted in a lower incidence of grade III xerostomia, but not all patients were symptom-free. The results suggest that unilateral sparing may help reduce the severity of xerostomia, but complete prevention cannot be guaranteed. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and optimize parotid gland sparing techniques."}
{"answers": "It is important to continue FA supplementation over the long term in patients on methotrexate and FA in order to prevent them discontinuing treatment because of mouth ulcers or nausea and vomiting. Our data suggest that FA supplementation is also helpful in preventing neutropenia, with very little loss of efficacy of methotrexate.", "prediction_text": "The available evidence does not definitively prove that folic acid supplementation decreases methotrexate toxicity, and there is a theoretical risk that it may decrease methotrexate efficacy. The present study suggests that discontinuing folic acid supplementation in rheumatoid arthritis patients established on methotrexate and folic acid 5 mg daily does not significantly impact disease activity, but may increase the risk of toxicity, particularly nausea. However, the study was small and further research is needed to confirm these findings. Ultimately, the decision to continue or discontinue folic acid supplementation should be made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with a healthcare"}
{"answers": "LF and cruroplasty is feasible and has good results in terms of GERD symptoms control and additional weight loss. The high rate of postoperative complications observed in this series remains a matter of concern. A re-sleeve procedure might be considered as an alternative to RYGB/DS conversion restricted to selected patients.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that laparoscopic fundectomy is a safe and effective revision surgery for patients with a residual fundus/neofundus after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, leading to improvements in GERD symptoms and additional weight loss. However, further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "VAT area measurement at a single level 3 cm above the lower margin of the L3 vertebra is feasible and can reflect changes in VAT volume and body weight. Advances in knowledge: As VAT area at a CT slice 3cm above the lower margin of L3 can best reflect interval changes in VAT volume and body weight, VAT area measurement should be selected at this location.", "prediction_text": "The visceral adipose tissue area measurement at a level 3 cm above the lower margin of L3 shows strong correlations with both visceral adipose tissue volume and body weight changes. This level can be considered for accurate and sensitive measurement of visceral adipose tissue. However, further studies are needed to confirm these findings and to evaluate the reproducibility and applicability to different populations."}
{"answers": "Barrett's cytokeratin 7/20 pattern can be a useful marker for the diagnosis of short-segment Barrett's oesophagus, although the false positive or false negative rate is approximately 25%.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that cytokeratin 7/20 immunostaining can be a useful diagnostic tool for short-segment Barrett's oesophagus in Korea, with a sensitivity of 77.8% and specificity of 77.5%. However, it is important to note that this is not a definitive diagnostic test and should be used in conjunction with other diagnostic methods. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and establish the role of cytokeratin 7/20 immunostaining in the diagnosis of Barrett's oesophagus in different populations."}
{"answers": "In this paper the effect of lunar phases on the time of delivery is shown. This influence seems to be especially relevant in the case of multiparae and plurigravidae. Nevertheless, it is too weak to allow for prediction regarding the days with the highest frequency of deliveries.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that there is a correlation between lunar position and the time of spontaneous full-term deliveries, particularly in multiparae and plurigravidae, who tend to deliver around the first or second day after a full moon. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Financial incentives for smoking cessation in pregnancy are highly cost-effective, with an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life years of \u00a3482, which is well below recommended decision thresholds.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that financial incentives up to \u00a3400 for smoking cessation during pregnancy are cost-effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of \u00a3482/QALY ($734/QALY), which is within the commonly accepted threshold for cost-effectiveness in the UK. However, the results are uncertain due to the potential for relapse after birth and the need for further research is recommended."}
{"answers": "This data demonstrates the robust nature of the short stay ward. At these two very different institutions we have shown improved bed efficient and patient care in a cost-effective way. We have also reported on greater parental satisfaction and early return of the child with their family to the community.", "prediction_text": "The short stay wards at both Westmead Hospital and The New Children's Hospital were effective in reducing length of stay, increasing hospital efficiency, and decreasing admission to in-hospital beds and unscheduled visits, without reported adverse events and high patient satisfaction. The savings to the hospital were significant."}
{"answers": "Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery is a safe method of treatment in patients with Cushing's disease. Operative findings, radiological and histological findings, together with early postoperative serum cortisol and urine free cortisol estimates may identify failures in treatment. Alternative treatment might then be required for these patients. Because of the risk of late relapse, patients require life-long follow-up.", "prediction_text": "The presence of a tumor identified at surgery and positive radiological and histological findings are predictors of a successful outcome (remission) in patients undergoing transsphenoidal pituitary surgery for Cushing's disease. Additionally, normalization of cortisol levels in the early postoperative period can help identify patients who are unlikely to achieve remission. However, some patients may still require hormonal replacement therapy and a small percentage may experience relapse or require a second operation."}
{"answers": "Patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms have a great diversity of functional somatic symptoms. They use more somatic and psychotropic drugs than controls in the years before diagnosis. Moreover, they show high rates of referrals and psychiatric morbidity. The diversity of symptoms of patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms supports the concept that symptoms do not cluster in well defined distinct syndromes. Therefore, patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms should preferably not be classified into medical subspecialty syndromes.", "prediction_text": "Chronic functional somatic symptoms are not a single syndrome, but rather a complex condition associated with increased comorbidity, higher medication use, more frequent GP visits, greater psychiatric morbidity, and increased referrals to mental health workers and somatic specialists. These findings suggest that chronic functional somatic symptoms may represent a heterogeneous group of conditions. Further research is needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms and to develop effective interventions."}
{"answers": "The vast majority of MDT decisions are implemented. Management alteration was most often due to patient choice or additional information available after the MDT. A minority of management alterations were 'unjustifiable' and the authors recommend that any patient whose treatment is subsequently changed should have MDT rediscussion prior to treatment.", "prediction_text": "In the majority of cases, the multidisciplinary team's recommendations were followed (91.5%). However, there were some discordant decisions (4.5%), with most being justifiable due to additional information or patient choice. A small percentage (17.8% of discordant decisions) were considered unjustifiable."}
{"answers": "We found that 1.6% of S. aureus (all MSSA) from bacteraemic patients were PVL-positive. This low incidence suggests that PVL-positive S. aureus are of no particular significance as causative agents of S. aureus bacteraemia.", "prediction_text": "The prevalence of PVL-positive S. aureus isolates among bacteraemia cases in the UK and Ireland was low (1.6%). The clinical significance of PVL in the pathogenesis of primary bacteraemia caused by S. aureus remains uncertain. The limited number of PVL-positive isolates in this study does not allow for definitive conclusions to be drawn. Further research is needed to establish the role of PVL in the pathogenesis of S. aureus bacteraemia."}
{"answers": "These findings are in accordance with previous experimental work and provide additional support for the assertion that dogs can prime autistic children for therapy. Ultimately, this study may contribute toward a change for full acceptance of canine-assisted therapy programs within the medical milieu. Additional studies using a similar research protocol on more autistic children will certainly help professionals to work on the most effective methods to individually serve this population through canine-assisted interventions.", "prediction_text": "The present study provides quantitative evidence that the presence of a therapy dog during structured activities can positively modulate the behavior of a child with autism spectrum disorder, with more frequent and longer durations of positive behaviors and less frequent and shorter durations of negative behaviors. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings and establish the effectiveness of canine-assisted therapy as a standard intervention for children with ASD."}
{"answers": "We conclude that increased cardiovascular risk of the DD genotype is not mediated through insulin resistance or abnormalities in fibrinolysis. Conversely, we report an increased sensitivity in NIDDM subjects with the ACE DD genotype.", "prediction_text": "The D deletion allele of the ACE gene is associated with insulin resistance in non-insulin-dependent diabetic subjects, as evidenced by lower insulin levels and increased insulin sensitivity. However, no such association was found in nondiabetic subjects. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and elucidate the underlying mechanism."}
{"answers": "A history of PIPE may be a risk factor for the development of IPE. Yet, the disappearance of significance on multivariate analysis indicates that it is not an independent predictor.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this retrospective study suggest that a history of postictal psychotic episodes (PIPE) does not independently predict the development of interictal psychotic episodes (IPE) in adults with partial seizure disorders. Other factors, such as male gender and having bilateral ictal foci, may also play a role in the development of IPE. However, the small sample size and lack of statistical significance in multivariate analysis limit the generalizability of these findings. Further research is needed to confirm these results."}
{"answers": "QTcD is significantly increased in hypertensive patients with LVH compared with those without, being strongly correlated with the indices of LVH. A QTcD cut-off value of 60 ms predicted LVH in hypertensive patients with a high sensitivity and specificity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that a corrected QT dispersion (QTcD) of 60 ms or greater can predict left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in hypertensive patients with a sensitivity of 92.9% and specificity of 98.2%."}
{"answers": "The shaving of the incision site immediately before spinal surgery may increase the rate of postoperative infection.", "prediction_text": "Yes, according to this study, shaving the incision site before spinal surgery increases the infection rate compared to not shaving it. (4 infections in the shaved group vs. 1 infection in the non-shaved group, P<0.01). However, it is important to note that this is just one study and more research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "The majority of EMS professionals thought that they should participate in disease and injury prevention programs. The respondents were mixed as to whether prevention services should be provided while on emergency calls, but those with experience providing these services were more likely to agree with providing them during emergency calls.", "prediction_text": "The majority (82.7%) of EMS professionals believe that they should participate in disease prevention. However, only about a third (33.8%) of respondents reported having provided prevention services. Those with a graduate degree, longer EMS experience, military background, working longer hours, and responding to zero emergency calls in a typical week were more likely to have provided prevention services. About half (51.1%) of the respondents agreed that prevention services should be provided during emergency calls. Those who had participated in prevention programs were more likely to believe that EMS professionals should participate in prevention and provide prevention services during emergency calls."}
{"answers": "Current K/DOQI guidelines are inadequate for correcting VDDI or secondary hyperparathyroidism in CKD patients. Future studies should examine the effects of higher or more frequent dosing of ergocalciferol on these clinical endpoints.", "prediction_text": "The results of this study suggest that the current K/DOQI recommended doses of ergocalciferol may not be adequate for correcting vitamin D deficiency and hyperparathyroidism in CKD patients. Only about half of the patients achieved a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level > 30 ng/ml (75 nmol/l), and only a quarter had a >30% decrease in iPTH levels. Further research is needed to determine optimal dosing strategies for vitamin D replacement in CKD patients."}
{"answers": "Baseline pain intensity does not predict the outcome after an appropriate opioid titration. It is likely that non-homogeneous pain treatment would have biased the outcome of a previous work.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a correlation between pain intensity at admission and opioid response in cancer patients. However, patients with poor opioid response (response 'd') and those requiring more aggressive opioid escalation (response 'b') showed higher values of OEImg. Further research is needed to understand the factors influencing opioid response in cancer patients."}
{"answers": "Maintaining viral load suppression over time in resource-limited-settings is feasible.", "prediction_text": "In this retrospective study of HIV-infected patients diagnosed in the pre-HAART era in a resource-limited setting, 87.3% were on HAART with a median duration of 14 years, and 87.3% achieved and maintained viral load suppression. However, 16.5% experienced virologic failure and required third-line ART regimens, which were associated with a 2.7-fold increased risk of failure compared to first- or second-line regimens. The study suggests that while it is feasible to maintain viral load suppression in resource-limited settings, the risk of virologic failure and the need for third-"}
{"answers": "Mucosal redundancy is a constant associated finding in IHPS. Although the origin of the redundancy and a cause-and-effect relationship are difficult to establish, our findings support the hypothesis that hypergastrinemia may be implicated in the pathogenesis of IHPS, and suggest that mucosal thickening could be implicated as one of the initiating factors in its development.", "prediction_text": "This study provides in vivo evidence of pyloric mucosal hypertrophy in infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, suggesting a possible etiologic role. However, the cause of this mucosal hypertrophy remains unclear and requires further investigation."}
{"answers": "Given the available screening technologies, discordant TEOAE and AABR may be inevitable for some categories of hearing loss among apparently healthy newborns whose mothers received prenatal care. The potential limitations of perinatal morbidities as basis of targeted screening for such cases therefore merit further consideration.", "prediction_text": "Yes, discordant outcomes between TEOAE and AABR in newborns can be predicted by certain maternal and infant factors, including antenatal care attendance, mode of delivery, and nursery type. These factors can help identify infants at risk for false-positive or false-negative results, allowing for appropriate follow-up and intervention."}
{"answers": "GM of CRC and SLM was associated with fewer procedures but did not influence overall survival. SM was associated with a longer delay and increased use of chemotherapy between procedures, suggesting that more rigorous selection of SM patients for surgery may explain the higher disease-free survival after SLM resection.", "prediction_text": "The retrospective study suggests that global management of colorectal cancer with synchronous liver metastases at the same center may result in a lower mean number of procedures, but it does not significantly improve three-month mortality or overall survival rates at 3 or 5 years. However, disease-free survival to 5 years is higher in the global management group. The use of chemotherapy prior to liver surgery and the median delay between procedures differed significantly between the two groups. Further studies with larger populations are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "epiDWI has the potential to differentiate pleomorphic adenoma and myoepithelial adenomas from all other examined entities. Due to an overlap not only within the group of benign and malignant lesions but also between groups, diagnoses should not be addressed on the basis of ADC values solely. Therefore, further studies combining DWI, morphologic criteria, and probably other MR imaging techniques seem warranted.", "prediction_text": "Echo-planar diffusion-weighted MR imaging (epiDWI) can help differentiate certain types of primary parotid gland tumors, specifically pleomorphic adenomas from other entities such as Warthin tumors, lipomas, and salivary duct carcinomas. However, it cannot distinguish between other histologic subtypes such as mucoepidermoid carcinomas, acinic cell carcinomas, and basal cell adenocarcinomas."}
{"answers": "The survey shows significant dissatisfaction amongst consultant radiologists with the current service, confirms a low number of paediatric radiologists taking on this work, and suggests the potential to increase numbers of radiology child abuse experts by 27% if given improved training and support. Appropriate service and education strategies should be implemented.", "prediction_text": "The survey results suggest that there are gaps in the provision of specialized paediatric radiology services and expertise for reporting skeletal surveys in suspected child abuse cases in the UK. Many radiologists felt that the service could be improved and only a small percentage were willing to provide expert evidence."}
{"answers": "The enhancement of serum TNFalpha and IL-6 levels in the patients with ERCP-induced pancreatitis reflects the inflammatory activity. Additionally, these cytokines together with IL-4 can be used in clinical laboratory monitoring of ERCP.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that changes in the serum levels of IL-4, TNFalpha, and IL-6 may reflect the inflammatory activity in the development of post-ERCP pancreatitis. Specifically, lower IL-4 levels and higher TNFalpha and IL-6 levels were observed in patients who developed post-ERCP pancreatitis compared to those who did not. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine the clinical significance of these cytokine changes."}
{"answers": "During the 5 years, 24% of Africans with optimal BP developed hypertension. The surge in hypertension in Africa is largely explained by modifiable risk factors. Public health strategies should focus aggressively on lifestyle to prevent a catastrophic burden on the national health system.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that smoking, greater waist circumference, and higher \u03b3-glutamyltransferase levels at baseline are associated with an increased risk of developing hypertension in Black South Africans with optimal blood pressure. Alcohol intake and waist circumference were also independent predictors of blood pressure changes and carotid cross-sectional wall area at follow-up. HIV infection was inversely associated with increased BP. These findings suggest that behavioural risk factors and metabolic factors play a role in the development of hypertension in this population."}
{"answers": "Our data have revealed a number of differences. Compared to the clinic sample, the Web-based sample had worse psychological symptom burden, younger average age, higher prevalence of employment, and a lower proportion on ART. For future research, we recommend that Web-based data collection should include the demographic variables that we note differed between samples. In addition, we recognize that each recruitment method may bring inherent sampling bias, with clinic populations differing by geographical location and reflecting those accessing regular medical care, and Web-based sampling recruiting those with greater Internet access and identifying survey materials through specific searches and contact with specific websites.", "prediction_text": "The Web-based sample of gay men living with HIV was younger, more likely to be employed, less likely to be on antiretroviral therapy, and reported higher psychological symptom burden compared to the clinic sample. However, physical symptom burden was similar between the two groups. In multivariable analysis, employment status was significantly associated with both high physical and psychological symptom burden, while recruitment setting (Web-based vs clinic) was only significantly associated with high psychological symptom burden."}
{"answers": "The majority of acetabular components in this cohort were stable despite the small contact surface achieved between the component and pelvic bone. Three of 10 migrated in excess of the limits that predict later loosening in primary THA but it remains to be seen whether these limits apply to this selected group of frail osteoporotic patients. We continue to use this technique routinely to treat patients with the same indications, but since the analysis of these data we have added screw fixation of the acetabular component to the ischial tuberosity and the superior pubic ramus.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups can provide initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures, but some components had migration above the suggested limits for primary THA at 1 year postoperatively. Further research is needed to determine long-term stability and revision rates."}
{"answers": "Despite high perioperative mortality, results document a sustainable recovery of the survivors offering the prospect of a highly independent and satisfying life. Therefore, advanced age alone should not be a contraindication for redo cardiac interventions. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2016; 16: 1138-1144.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that while cardiac reoperations in octogenarians are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, survivors showed good functional status and quality of life, with physical and mental health scores similar to age- and sex-matched normative population. The decision to perform a cardiac reoperation in octogenarians should be individualized based on patient's clinical condition and expected benefits."}
{"answers": "Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (ie, SMI) were more likely than other patients to be admitted to nursing homes with higher deficiency citations for both overall quality and clinical care quality. Further research is necessary to understand the reasons behind the disparity in quality of nursing home care associated with SMI.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patients with serious mental illness, specifically those with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, are more likely to be admitted to nursing homes with more deficiencies in care compared to other patients. This association persisted even after controlling for various factors."}
{"answers": "Patients undergoing open access procedures are less likely to be properly informed about their endoscopic procedure. Our results indicate that with open access endoscopy, a defined mechanism needs to be in place for communication of endoscopic results to the patient.", "prediction_text": "Open access endoscopy patients reported receiving less procedure information and explanation compared to patients from a GI subspecialty clinic. This may impact patient satisfaction and communication of results. Further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term consequences of this difference."}
{"answers": "Contrary to common belief, we found that uterine myomas commonly decrease in volume over the course of pregnancy.", "prediction_text": "Uterine myomas can exhibit both growth and shrinkage during pregnancy. In the first half to second quarter, about half of the myomas decreased in size, while the other half enlarged. In the second quarter to third quarter, most myomas shrank, but some continued to grow. Overall, the mean decrease in volume during pregnancy was about 30%. However, individual myomas can exhibit significant variation in size change."}
{"answers": "We found that all of the studied dimensions of restricted fetal growth are independently associated with increased risks of low intellectual performance and that these associations are only partly mediated by socioeconomic or familial factors.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the association between measures of fetal growth restriction, such as low birth weight and small head circumference for gestational age, and intellectual performance in early adulthood was not completely explained by socioeconomic factors or familial effects. Both factors played a role in the increased risk of low intellectual performance. However, the study did not examine other potential confounding factors, such as genetics or environmental factors, which could also influence the relationship between fetal growth restriction and intellectual performance. Further research is needed to fully understand the underlying mechanisms of this association."}
{"answers": "Although feasible, double reading of barium enemas does not improve sensitivity for detection of polyps and produces a higher false-positive rate.", "prediction_text": "Double reading of barium enemas increases the number of detected lesions and potential alteration of clinical treatment, but decreases specificity and overall agreement, and requires additional time. The decision to implement double reading should consider the balance between increased detection and additional resources and potential impact on patient care."}
{"answers": "The VMPA can provide direct access and favorable visibility to the TMJ region and yield good esthetic and functional results. The VMPA can be considered the approach of choice for common TMJ surgeries.", "prediction_text": "The vascular-guided multilayer preauricular approach (VMPA) to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is a safe and effective surgical technique, resulting in successful TMJ surgeries for all patients, with favorable incision healing and no reported permanent facial nerve weakness or severe complications."}
{"answers": "The metastasis rate of station 9 lymph nodes was significantly lower than other mediastinal stations in lung cancer patients. The metastasis status of station 9 had no significant influence on tumor staging or prognosis. Routine dissection of station 9 lymph nodes may not be necessary, especially in patients with a low T stage, upper or middle lobe tumors, or without intrapulmonary lymph node metastasis.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, the metastasis rate of station 9 lymph nodes was low and not statistically significant in males or ground glass opacity patients. The staging results of most patients would not be affected if station 9 nodes were not dissected, and the prognostic analysis showed no significant influence on survival. Therefore, routine dissection of station 9 lymph nodes may not be necessary for primary lung cancer. However, further research is needed to confirm these results."}
{"answers": "During the time period considered, the FDA AED-related suicidality warning does not appear to have significantly affected prescription claims of AED medications for the study population.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find a significant change in the trend of antiepileptic drug prescription claims before, during, or after the FDA suicidality warning. However, the study was limited by the use of Medicaid claims data and the inability to account for confounding factors such as changes in prescribing practices or patient characteristics. Further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between the FDA warning and antiepileptic drug prescription trends."}
{"answers": "In our population of stroke survivors, self-reports of motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions differed from government records. In future studies, the use of both government and self-reported data would ensure a more accurate picture of driving safety post-stroke.", "prediction_text": "There is only moderate agreement between self-reported data and government records regarding motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions in stroke survivors. The use of both sources of data can identify up to 56% more accidents and up to 46% more convictions."}
{"answers": "The realized communication skills courses resulted in relevant changes in communication behaviour and self-confidence of participants. Communication with terminally ill patients can be taught.", "prediction_text": "Yes, communication skills for interacting with terminally ill patients can be effectively taught through 2-day courses, as evidenced by increased participant satisfaction, improved self-assessed sense of security, and reported changes in communication behavior."}
{"answers": "For conditions with a well-developed quality of care evidence base, such as hypertension and diabetes, a single structured implicit review to assess the quality of care over a period of time is moderately reliable. This method could be a reasonable complement or alternative to explicit indicator approaches for assessing and comparing quality of care. Structured implicit review, like explicit quality measures, must be used more cautiously for illnesses for which the evidence base is less well developed, such as COPD and acute, short-course illnesses.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that peer review can play a role in profiling quality of care, particularly for conditions with a well-developed evidence base, such as diabetes and hypertension. However, the reliability of peer review is lower for conditions with a less developed evidence base, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and a collection of acute conditions. The higher reliability for conditions with a well-developed evidence base is due to the reviewers' ability to distinguish more differences in the quality of care between patients, rather than less random noise or individual reviewer bias."}
{"answers": "The high rate of unsuccessful IUD insertions reported here, particularly for nulliparous women, suggests that the true insertion failure rate of providers who are not employing additional tools for difficult insertions may be much higher than reported in clinical trials. Further investigation is necessary to determine if this is a common problem and, if so, to assess if the use of adjuvant measures will reduce the number of unsuccessful IUD insertions.", "prediction_text": "The study found that 19.6% of IUD insertions in nulliparous women and 13.6% in parous women were unsuccessful. The adjusted odds ratio suggested a higher risk of failure in nulliparous women, although the difference was not statistically significant. The use of adjuvant measures to facilitate difficult insertions was not reported in this study. Further research is needed to understand the reasons for failed IUD insertions and to identify effective strategies to improve success rates."}
{"answers": "Even in capped health care systems, virtual planning and guided surgery including prebent or milled plates are financially viable.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, the use of virtual planning and guided surgery for mandibular reconstruction with fibular free flaps can result in significant time savings during surgery, which in turn can offset the additional cost of the planning and cutting-guide production. The cost reduction for prebent plates was estimated to be around US $3,866.50 and for milled plates around US $3,866.50. However, further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these results."}
{"answers": "Bipolarity does not independently influence risk of suicidal behavior or alter the influence of well-established suicide risk factors within affective disorders. Suicide risk assessment strategies may continue to appraise these common risk factors without regard to mood polarity.", "prediction_text": "The study found that age, hopelessness, and active substance abuse were significant predictors of suicidal behavior, regardless of affective disorder polarity. No significant differences in risk factors were found between major depressive and bipolar disorders."}
{"answers": "The administration of polyvalent Crotalidae antivenin is safe. Acute hypersensitivity, when it occurs, consists solely in most cases of urticaria. Serious side effects are uncommon.", "prediction_text": "The study found that acute side effects from the use of polyvalent antivenin in rattlesnake bite victims were uncommon, with only 18% of patients experiencing urticaria. No deaths, amputations, or permanent disabilities occurred in the patients receiving antivenin. However, the study did not collect data on serum sickness, which is a potential long-term complication of antivenin use."}
{"answers": "Although endomyocardial fibrosis patients have improved clinical symptoms after surgery, the global left ventricular ejection fraction and regional wall motion in these patients do not change. This finding suggests that other explanations, such as improvements in diastolic function, may be operational.", "prediction_text": "In this study, there was no significant change in quantitative left ventricular regional wall motion after fibrous tissue resection in endomyocardial fibrosis patients. However, there was an improvement in New York Heart Association functional class postoperatively."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrates that laser pretreatment significantly increases absorption of topical lidocaine so that it is detectable in the blood and that manipulating laser settings can affect drug absorption. Future work will look at translating this effect into clinical benefit.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the results of this study demonstrate that fractional laser treatment enhances transdermal absorption of topical lidocaine in an in vivo animal model. The study also suggests that the depth of laser ablation can influence the extent of absorption. However, further studies are needed to confirm these findings in humans and to evaluate the clinical implications."}
{"answers": "Vaccines were exposed to temperatures that may reduce their potency. Safe storage of vaccines in the clinics cannot be ensured without adhering to the recommended guidelines. Provision of adequate equipment and training for staff in maintaining the \"cold chain\" and the use and care of equipment are important components of a successful immunisation programme.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that there are significant issues with vaccine storage in the community, with many practices not adhering to Department of Health guidelines and vaccines being exposed to suboptimal temperatures. This could potentially compromise vaccine efficacy and safety. Further interventions and education are needed to improve vaccine storage practices in the community."}
{"answers": "p53 alteration detected by IHC or SSCP analysis is not a clinically useful predictor of local response to pre-operative adjuvant therapy in advanced rectal carcinoma.", "prediction_text": "The results of this study do not provide strong evidence that p53 alterations can be used to predict tumor response to pre-operative chemo-radiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer. Further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "The results of this study cast doubt on the suggested advantage of HBO in reducing patient mortality and morbidity when used as adjuvant therapy for NF.", "prediction_text": "The evidence from this retrospective study suggests that the use of hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) in the treatment of necrotizing fasciitis (NF) does not result in a significant reduction in mortality or morbidity, and may even require more surgical debridements compared to standard treatment with surgery and antibiotics alone. However, the controversy surrounding the use of HBO for NF remains, and larger, well-designed studies are needed to definitively determine its role in the treatment of this condition."}
{"answers": "High doses of ZNS are effective and safe in pharmacoresistant epileptic patients. Therapeutic drug monitoring of ZNS may be considered at therapeutic failure.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that high doses of zonisamide (>500 mg/d) can be effective and tolerated by some adult European patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy. However, the sample size was small and more research is needed to confirm these findings and establish optimal dosing and safety."}
{"answers": "In conclusion, high Ki-67 expression was associated with poor survival in patients with UTUC, as well as a high risk of disease progression, although these findings need to be interpreted with caution. Large-scale, adequately designed, prospective trials are needed to further confirm the value of Ki-67 in prognosis of UTUC patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, overexpression of Ki-67 is a significant prognostic biomarker for poor cancer-specific survival, disease-free survival, and disease progression in patients with upper tract urinary carcinoma."}
{"answers": "After comparing MR with arthroscopic findings and reviewing the available literature, we conclude that arthroscopy permits the direct visualization of even fine articular surface changes but does not depict the subchondral bone, the most frequent site of injury detected with MRI. MRI was a very useful tool in the detection and characterization of the different types of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries and showed a statistically significant correlation between site and distribution of bone and cartilage injuries and between internal damage and trauma mechanisms. Therefore, we believe that MRI can help avoid diagnostic arthroscopy in the patients with a history of post-traumatic pain, acute articular blocks and negative radiographic findings.", "prediction_text": "MRI can detect and characterize various types of occult post-traumatic injuries of the knee, including bone bruises, subchondral, and osteochondral injuries. However, it may not completely replace diagnostic arthroscopy as MRI may not detect all chondral injuries and cannot provide the same level of detail for surgical planning. MRI is a valuable tool in the diagnostic workup of patients with suspected occult knee injuries and negative conventional radiographs."}
{"answers": "The prevalence of cognitive impairment in MND in this population based study of an unselected cohort was higher than has been previously reported. Language deficits, especially anomia, may be relatively frequent in the MND population. Aphasia in MND may be masked by dysarthria and missed if not specifically examined.", "prediction_text": "Approximately one in three patients with motor neuron disease (MND) present with cognitive dysfunction and/or language deficits, including dementia and aphasia. These findings highlight the importance of comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation in the assessment of MND patients."}
{"answers": "Postoperative numbness occurs in most patients receiving nasal microfat injections. Partial to complete recovery of nasal tip sensation can be expected to occur over a 3-month period.", "prediction_text": "Yes, sensation in the nasal tip gradually returns after microfat grafting, but there is a significant decrease in sensation immediately following the procedure. The time course of sensation recovery varies, with full recovery observed in most cases by 12 weeks post-procedure."}
{"answers": "Conveyance of emotions or movements through music may be decoded differently by persons with different types of communication disorders. Because music is the primary therapeutic tool in music therapy sessions, clinicians should consider these differential abilities when selecting music for clinical interventions focusing on emotions or movement.", "prediction_text": "Yes, communication disorders, such as severe to profound hearing loss in children with cochlear implants, can impair the recognition of symbolic representation of emotions and movements in music. This can negatively impact music therapy interventions. However, children with autism spectrum disorder did not show significant differences in musical emotion or movement recognition compared to typically developing children with normal hearing."}
{"answers": "For some patients, using colour to describe their pain experience may be a useful tool to improve doctor-patient communication.", "prediction_text": "The use of color to describe osteoarthritis pain is generally acceptable to patients, with red being commonly associated with high-intensity pain due to its symbolism of inflammation and intensity. However, the interpretability and standardization of color as a means of communicating pain to healthcare professionals remains a concern."}
{"answers": "It appears safe to administer intensive chemotherapy regimens at standard doses to rural patients without increased morbidity or mortality. Support for general practitioners through phone or videoconferencing may reduce the safety concerns.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this retrospective audit, there were no significant differences in serious adverse events or dose intensities between urban and rural patients receiving intensive chemotherapy regimens for node-positive breast and metastatic colorectal cancers at Townsville Cancer Centre. The practice appears to be safe for rural patients. However, larger studies are needed to confirm these results."}
{"answers": "Although outcomes for EPSCC remains poor, both surgery and radiation is shown to significantly improve median, 5- and 10-year survival rates. EPSCC patients who are potential candidates for surgical resection or radiation therapy may benefit from these treatments.", "prediction_text": "The study found that surgery and radiation therapy improved survival for patients with extrapulmonary small cell carcinomas, particularly those with gastrointestinal disease. Independent predictors of survival included age, gender, stage, radiation, and surgery."}
{"answers": "DGE after PPPD seems to be of minor clinical importance following uncomplicated surgery. When taking the results into consideration, it can be said that, despite the lack of a control group, antecolic duodenojejunostomy might be the key to a low incidence of DGE after PPPD. In our experience, DGE is linked to the occurrence of other postoperative complications rather than to pylorus preservation.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that performing a retrocolic duodenojejunostomy antecolically during pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy may reduce the incidence of delayed gastric emptying. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "In women with POP, the symptom of pelvic pain is associated with the presence of defecatory symptoms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, pelvic pain is significantly associated with defecatory symptoms in women with pelvic organ prolapse. Women with pelvic pain are more likely to experience symptoms such as straining with bowel movement, sense of incomplete emptying, pain with bowel movement, and splinting with bowel movement."}
{"answers": "The results confirm that c-kit is vastly expressed in uveal melanoma, suggest that the c-kit molecular pathway may be important in uveal melanoma growth, and point to its use as a target for therapy with STI571.", "prediction_text": "The expression and phosphorylation of c-kit in uveal melanoma cells, along with the sensitivity of uveal melanoma cell lines to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571, suggest that c-kit-dependent growth of uveal melanoma cells is a potential therapeutic target. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and explore the clinical implications."}
{"answers": "Results suggest that telmisartan may reduce type-I diabetes mellitus-induced hepatic injury by suppressing activated hepatic stellate cells through concomitant TGF-beta1 down-regulation.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, telmisartan may have a protective effect against hepatic fibrosis in rats with alloxan-induced diabetes, as indicated by a decrease in TGF-beta immunoreactivity. However, further research is needed to confirm these results in humans."}
{"answers": "The great majority of U.S. renal transplant centers will not transplant kidneys to HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease, even if their infection is asymptomatic. However, advances in the management of HIV infection and a review of relevant ethical issues suggest that this approach should be reconsidered.", "prediction_text": "Based on the information provided in the medical paper, the majority of U.S. transplant centers still exclude asymptomatic HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease from transplantation due to concerns about harm to the individual and the perceived waste of precious organs. However, recent advances in HIV management and prognosis suggest that this policy should be reevaluated. Further research and dialogue are needed to determine the safety and efficacy of transplanting HIV-infected patients and to address the concerns of transplant centers."}
{"answers": "The overall yield of SL for HCC was 7 %, and the accuracy was 27 %. When accurate imaging methods are available and additional percutaneous liver biopsy is implemented as a standard procedure in the preoperative workup of patients with HCC, the benefit of SL will become even less.", "prediction_text": "The yield and accuracy of staging laparoscopy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma are relatively low, but it can still be useful in identifying unresectable tumors and assessing fibrosis/cirrhosis, potentially changing management in some cases."}
{"answers": "Expert breast pathology assessments continue to be necessary in the management of DCIS.", "prediction_text": "Yes, expert breast pathology assessment is necessary for the management of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) as it can significantly impact risk assessment and treatment decisions. The review process can lead to changes in local recurrence risk assessment in nearly 30% of cases and changes in treatment recommendations in over 40% of cases."}
{"answers": "Vaginal pH should be measured by bringing the pH strip in direct contact with fresh vaginal fluid without first adding saline.", "prediction_text": "Measuring vaginal pH from a wet mount slide after the addition of saline is not an accurate method and can result in false positive readings. Direct measurement on fresh vaginal fluid is recommended instead."}
{"answers": "This study presents a different clinical picture of oral mucoceles/ranulas, as observed in HIV-positive patients. Additionally, it suggests a possible clinical link between the two pathologies. The authors strongly support the suggestion that oral mucocele/ranula is an HIV-related salivary gland disease.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that HIV-positive patients are at a significantly higher risk (P<0.001) of developing both simple and plunging ranulas compared to HIV-negative patients."}
{"answers": "There are no data to support the widespread practice of using central venous pressure to guide fluid therapy. This approach to fluid resuscitation should be abandoned.", "prediction_text": "The results of this updated meta-analysis suggest that central venous pressure does not reliably predict fluid responsiveness, as indicated by a summary AUC of 0.56 (95% CI, 0.54-0.58) with no heterogeneity between studies. The correlation coefficient between central venous pressure and change in stroke volume index/cardiac index was also low (0.18, 95% CI, 0.1-0.25). These findings support the conclusion that central venous pressure should not be used to make clinical decisions regarding fluid management."}
{"answers": "Increased D-dimer levels should not be considered as a diagnostic parameter in diagnosis of acute appendicitis.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, D-dimer levels do not appear to be a significant diagnostic parameter for acute appendicitis. Further research with larger sample sizes and more comprehensive analysis is needed to confirm this conclusion."}
{"answers": "Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mitochondria play a role in the programmed cell death (PCD) process in the lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) by undergoing specific dynamics, including changes in distribution, motility, and membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m), and possibly involving mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) formation. These changes are associated with the progression of PCD and the eventual cell death."}
{"answers": "Our study emphasised the discomfort of transurethral urinary catheters, especially in male patients, and the high incidence of urinary tract infections in both sexes. Consideration should be given to the utilisation of alternative methods of bladder drainage, such as suprapubic catheterisation, which can be performed with ease during laparotomy.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that transurethral catheterisation is associated with lower patient satisfaction and increased risk of urinary tract infections, particularly in male patients. Further research is needed to explore alternative methods of bladder drainage for major abdominal surgery."}
{"answers": "Based on this pilot data, MASCC score appears promising in determining suitability for outpatient management of NF in gynecologic oncology patients. Prospective study is ongoing to confirm safety and determine impact on cost.", "prediction_text": "The MASCC risk index can be a useful tool for risk stratification of gynecologic oncology patients with neutropenic fever. Low-risk patients can be managed as outpatients, while high-risk patients require inpatient care due to increased risk of severe complications and mortality. However, the positive predictive value of the MASCC score is only 50%, indicating that some false positives may occur. Further studies with larger populations are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Halofantrine has mild to moderate pathological effects on cochlea histology, and can be considered an ototoxic drug.", "prediction_text": "Yes, halofantrine is ototoxic as shown by damage to inner and outer hair cells and loss of spiral ganglia cells in guinea pig cochlea at therapeutic and double therapeutic doses. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings in humans."}
{"answers": "Proportionally fewer elderly patients with OPSCC are being treated than younger individuals. These patients can have significant benefits from aggressive treatments despite their older age as shown by our survival analysis. We recommend the use of objective measures to assess patient fitness to reduce the potential for undertreatment in the elderly population.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that there is an increase in the number of elderly patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma not receiving treatment after the age of 55. However, the analysis also shows that aggressive therapy (surgery, radiation, or combined therapy) can lead to significant benefits in disease-specific survival for elderly patients aged 65 to 74 and 75 to 84. Therefore, it is recommended that elderly patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma receive aggressive therapy to improve their outcomes."}
{"answers": "Minimal access surgery for the repair of esophageal atresia or congenital diaphragmatic hernia is not associated with less cumulative opioid doses.", "prediction_text": "According to this study, there was no significant difference in opioid consumption or postoperative pain scores between neonates undergoing minimal access surgery and those undergoing conventional surgery for esophageal atresia and congenital diaphragmatic hernia."}
{"answers": "Clinical predictors appear inadequate for the evaluation of the cervical spine in geriatric trauma patients with low-energy mechanism.", "prediction_text": "The results of this study suggest that clinical predictors, including neck tenderness, may not be adequate in the identification of cervical spine fractures in geriatric blunt trauma patients with low-energy mechanism. Further research is needed to identify more accurate predictors or imaging modalities for this patient population."}
{"answers": "European individuals with type 1 diabetes consume a high atherogenic diet as few patients met recommendations for dietary fibre and saturated fat. This study showed minor changes in dietary nutrients and energy intakes over a period of 7 years. Nutrition education needs particular focus on strategies to increase dietary fibre and reduce saturated fat to exploit their potential benefit.", "prediction_text": "European individuals with type 1 diabetes do not consistently follow current European nutritional recommendations, particularly in regards to fiber and saturated fat intake, which are important factors in reducing cardiovascular disease risk. Despite some improvements in nutrient intake over a 7-year period, overall adherence to recommendations remains suboptimal."}
{"answers": "The gaps in patella eversion demonstrated smaller gaps both in knee extension and flexion position compared to the gaps of patella reduction position. The amount of decreased gaps was more definite in knee flexion position. Therefore, the intraoperative patellar positioning has influence on the measurement of the joint gap. Keeping the patella in reduced position is important during gap balancing.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patella position (reduced, subluxated, or everted) can influence ligament balancing during total knee arthroplasty. The study found that patella eversion resulted in smaller gaps in both knee extension and flexion positions compared to patella reduction. However, there was notable variability in knee flexion position and significant differences in lateral gaps between patella eversion and reduction in knee flexion position (p<0.05). Additionally, some knees with patella subluxation and eversion demonstrated increased or decreased gaps in knee flexion position compared to reduction position."}
{"answers": "We have thus provided compelling evidence that there is a mossy fiber GABAergic signal. The physiologic role of this mossy fiber GABAergic signal is uncertain, but may be of developmental importance. Other evidence suggests that this GABAergic signal is transiently upregulated after seizures. This could have an inhibitory or disinhibitory effect, and further work is needed to elucidate its actual role.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mossy fibers release GABA in addition to their primary excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate. This GABA release is thought to play a role in regulating the excitability of CA3 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus."}
{"answers": "Men and women in this community sample reported similar patterns of depressive symptoms. No evidence that the presentation of depressive symptoms differs by gender was found.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find evidence to suggest that gender differences in depressive symptom reporting account for the higher rates of depression in women. Other factors, such as sociodemographic characteristics, may play a role in the observed gender difference."}
{"answers": "Time to primary treatment after a diagnosis of breast cancer had no impact on overall survival. Further studies on care before diagnosis are important in drawing up meaningful quality indicators.", "prediction_text": "In this study, a delay in time to primary treatment after a diagnosis of breast cancer did not significantly impact overall survival. However, ethnicity and stage at presentation were associated with delayed treatment. Further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Our findings reveal a significant decrease in ADMA levels of ex-ELBW subjects compared to C, underlining a probable correlation with preterm birth and low birth weight. Taken together, these results may underlie the onset of early circulatory dysfunction predictive of increased cardiovascular risk.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that young adults born preterm at extremely low birth weight had significantly lower ADMA levels compared to healthy adults born at term. Additionally, ADMA levels were inversely correlated with gestational age and birth weight, suggesting that lower ADMA levels in preterm individuals may be a marker for early endothelial dysfunction. However, further research is needed to determine the clinical significance of these findings and their potential role in the development of cardiovascular diseases in later life."}
{"answers": "ECL assays improved the ability to predict time to diabetes in these autoantibody-positive relatives at risk for developing diabetes. These findings might be helpful in the design and eligibility criteria for prevention trials in the future.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the use of electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assays in addition to traditional radioimmunoassays (RIAs) for the detection of autoantibodies improves the prediction of time to type 1 diabetes in autoantibody-positive TrialNet subjects. The study showed that ECL positivity was significantly associated with a higher risk of progression to diabetes and improved the receiver operating characteristic curves when added to the Diabetes Prevention Trial risk score."}
{"answers": "These findings indicate that a relationship between multiple sclerosis and streptococcal infections may exist, but to acquire a better understanding of the role of group A streptococci in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, more studies with animal models are necessary.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that past streptococcal infection, as indicated by elevated antideoxyribonuclease B levels, may be associated with Multiple Sclerosis. However, further research is needed to confirm this relationship and to determine the underlying mechanisms."}
{"answers": "Aplastic anemia is associated with a variety of autoimmune syndromes. The sequence of events in our patient suggests that the hepatic failure, AFOP, and the VSAA may all have been part of an autoimmune syndrome. AFOP could be the result of immune dysregulation in this pediatric case with favorable outcome after immunosuppressive therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.", "prediction_text": "Acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP) is a rare, potentially fatal lung condition, and this case report describes the first known nonfatal case in a child. The underlying cause of AFOP is not well understood, but it has been associated with various conditions of immune dysregulation, including aplastic anemia. The patient in this study developed AFOP after being diagnosed with VSAA and responded to immunosuppressive therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between immune dysregulation and AFOP."}
{"answers": "Rescue AC may apply to only 18% of cases, and we identified subsets of more likely candidates.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that only a small proportion (17.9%) of women who received antenatal corticosteroids (AC) continued their pregnancy for more than a week and delivered before 34 weeks. Factors associated with delivering before 34 weeks after AC included preterm premature rupture of membranes, twins, and gestational age less than 28 weeks. The opportunity for rescue AC may be limited."}
{"answers": "The results show that fatigue in patients with pSS and sSS is not due to the coexistence of FM in most cases. A lower incidence in the United Kingdom of FM in patients with pSS was found than has been previously reported.", "prediction_text": "The study found that fatigue is more common in patients with primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (pSS) compared to lupus patients, but the prevalence of fibromyalgia syndrome (FM) was not significantly different between the two groups. The findings do not support a strong association between FM and pSS in this population."}
{"answers": "UDR provides an objective measurement of VUR and appears as a predictive tool of success after endoscopic injection.", "prediction_text": "Yes, distal ureteral diameter and ureteral diameter ratio were significant predictors of reflux resolution after endoscopic injection in children with primary vesicoureteral reflux."}
{"answers": ": Data from both association and expression studies suggested that variants at HINT1 may be associated with schizophrenia and the associations may be sex-specific. However, the markers showing associations were in high LD to the SPEC2/PDZ-GEF2/ACSL6 locus reported previously in the same samples. This made it difficult to separate the association signals amongst these genes. Other independent studies may be necessary to distinguish these candidate genes.", "prediction_text": "The HINT1 gene, located on chromosome 5q31.2, has been implicated in linkage studies of schizophrenia and is associated with dysregulation of postsynaptic dopamine transmission. Studies of 8 SNPs around the HINT1 gene region in the Irish study of high density schizophrenia families (ISHDSF) and the Irish case control study of schizophrenia (ICCSS) found nominally significant differences in allele frequencies in several SNPs for both samples in sex-stratified analyses. However, the sex effect differed between the two samples and no significant difference in expression was observed between patients and controls. Significant interactions amongst"}
{"answers": "Out of the four sacral sparing criteria, the acute phase anal sensory score measurements do not contribute significantly to the prognosis of independent ambulation. The combination of the acute phase voluntary anal contraction and the S4-5 LT and PP scores, predicts significantly better chronic phase-independent ambulation outcomes than the currently used distinction between complete and incomplete SCI.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that determination of sacral sparing measurements, specifically S4-5 light touch and pin prick, can provide better predictive values for independent ambulation in traumatic spinal cord injury patients compared to the current distinction between complete and incomplete SCI. These findings may improve clinical decision making and patient outcomes. However, further research is needed to confirm these results and establish the clinical utility of these measurements."}
{"answers": "These findings suggest that schizophrenia is associated with progressive structural brain abnormalities, affecting both gray and white matter. We found no evidence to suggest progressive medial temporal lobe involvement but did find evidence that this may be partly explained by heterogeneity between studies in patient age and illness duration. The causes and clinical correlates of these progressive brain changes should now be the focus of investigation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the findings from this systematic review suggest that patients with schizophrenia exhibit significant structural brain changes over time, including greater decreases in gray and white matter volumes in various brain regions and larger increases in lateral ventricular volume, compared to healthy control subjects."}
{"answers": "The elevated risk of death after CABG surgery known previously to be associated with CDM seems also to be shared by a group of similar size that includes patients with IFG and undiagnosed DM.", "prediction_text": "Impaired fasting blood glucose levels (5.6<fB-glu<6.1 mmol/L) and suspected diabetes mellitus (fB-glu>or=6.1 mmol/L) were associated with increased 30-day and 1-year mortality after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) compared to normal fB-glu (<5.6 mmol/L). The area under the curve for the continuous variable fB-glu and 1-year mortality was 0.65 (P=0.002). These findings suggest that impaired fasting glucose levels may"}
{"answers": "This is the first known report of concurrent plasma and ISF concentrations of a meropenem antibiotic during CVVHDF. We observed that the ISF concentrations of meropenem were significantly lower than the plasma concentrations, although the present dose was appropriate for infections caused by intermediately susceptible pathogens (MIC\u22644 mg/L).", "prediction_text": "The interstitial fluid concentrations of meropenem are lower than plasma concentrations in critically ill patients receiving continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF). The ISF penetration was estimated to be around 60-70%. The ISF trough concentrations were approximately 40% higher during the second profile, leading to increased ISF concentrations compared to plasma concentrations. However, the ISF concentrations were still lower than plasma concentrations overall."}
{"answers": "Despite advances in early diagnosis and surgical technique, 5-year survival of stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma remains low as compared to survival of other solid organ neoplasm. Tumour size<or=3cm, adenocarcinoma histologic type and negative bronchial resection margins were associated with a more favourable outcome in our patient population. More effective multimodality treatments are needed to increase survival rates.", "prediction_text": "While Stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma is considered an early stage, the findings from this study suggest that histology (adenocarcinoma vs squamous cell carcinoma), tumor size (<or=3cm vs >3cm), and the presence of a negative resection margin are significant prognostic factors for survival."}
{"answers": "There is a knowledge deficit regarding the SU treatment goal among gout patients receiving ULT, despite generally high levels of other gout-specific knowledge. SU goal information may be an important and underutilized concept among providers treating gout patients.", "prediction_text": "Only 14% of gout patients in this study were aware of their target serum urate goal, and having a rheumatologist as the initial prescriber and having correct answers for all other gout-specific knowledge questions were associated with greater odds of knowing the goal. Knowledge of the SU goal was associated with better self-reported global health status."}
{"answers": "Despite government assistance, low-income individuals use vision care services less often than wealthy individuals.", "prediction_text": "The study found that among middle-aged white individuals without major vision problems, those with financial difficulty had a lower utilization rate of eye care services (28.1%) compared to those without financial difficulty (41.9%). The study also noted that government-funded, low-income vision care programs in some provinces did not fully cover the cost of a routine eye examination or eyeglasses, which may have contributed to the lower utilization rate among low-income individuals. However, the study did not directly test the effect of the government assistance on utilization, and further research is needed to establish a causal relationship."}
{"answers": "Premature births from rural mothers have a higher risk of stillbirth and mortality in neonatal intensive care than urban infants.", "prediction_text": "Yes, infants born to mothers residing in rural areas have poorer neonatal outcomes, including higher mortality and stillbirth rates, compared to those born to mothers residing in urban areas, despite a coordinated referral and transport system. This difference persists even after adjusting for case mix and other factors."}
{"answers": "Altered ET-1 levels may be involved in the pathogenesis of rebound hypertension and hypotension during HD.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that endothelin-1 (ET-1) may play a role in the development of both hypotension and rebound hypertension during hemodialysis. ET-1 levels decreased in patients with dialysis-induced hypotension and increased in those with rebound hypertension. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to explore the potential use of ET-1 as a therapeutic target for managing hemodynamic instability during hemodialysis."}
{"answers": "While FS was commonly used in patients undergoing thyroidectomy at our institution, in no patient over the last decade did FS correctly alter the intraoperative management. Given the time required to perform FS and the cost associated with it, we believe that routine FS should not be performed in these patients.", "prediction_text": "The sensitivity of frozen section for the diagnosis of thyroid cancer in patients undergoing thyroidectomy for multinodular goiter is low (25%), and it did not alter the intraoperative management in any of the cases. Therefore, the routine use of frozen section during thyroidectomy for multinodular goiter may not be necessary."}
{"answers": "Elderly patients have informational and relational needs similar to those of younger patients. In fact, most of the whole sample flagged up the need for higher levels of satisfaction especially concerning a better dialogue with health staff, along with a new factor: the need to talk to people with the same illness.", "prediction_text": "Yes, elderly cancer patients have different care needs compared with younger ones, with a greater emphasis on financial-insurance information, the need to talk to people with the same illness, and the need for more comprehensible information from doctors and nurses. Additionally, older patients expressed a greater need for a better dialogue with clinicians."}
{"answers": "According to the results of our study and the data from the international literature, the entity globulomaxillary cyst is no longer justified.", "prediction_text": "The term \"globulomaxillary cyst\" is no longer considered a valid entity in the current medical literature. However, cystic lesions in the region previously referred to as globulomaxillary cysts do still occur. These lesions can be diagnosed and treated based on clinical, radiological, and histological findings, and can belong to various entities such as lateral periodontal cysts, radicular cysts, keratocystic odontogenic tumors, adenomatoid odontogenic tumors, periapical granulomas, residual cysts, and undefined jaw cysts."}
{"answers": "Although components of the CSM (cognitive and emotional representations, coping strategies) were associated with fears of recurrence, optimism was found to be the strongest predictor of fear, independent of anxiety and level of fear reported prior to treatment.", "prediction_text": "Pre-treatment fears of recurrence and optimism are significant predictors of long-term fears of recurrence in head and neck cancer survivors. Other factors such as sociodemographic, disease, treatment, or symptom-related factors do not appear to be closely related to fears of recurrence."}
{"answers": "Older adults enrolled in PICT with more symptoms may sacrifice QOL for experimental treatment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the presence of multiple symptoms in older adults with advanced cancer undergoing phase I clinical trials is associated with increased admissions, complications, and functional decline. Symptom burden should be considered when selecting patients for these trials."}
{"answers": "Effective CPAP treatment in IPF patients with OSA results in a significant improvement in daily living activities based on the FOSQ, namely an OSA-specific follow-up instrument. Improvement was also noted in other questionnaires assessing quality of life, though not to a statistically significant degree, probably because of the multifactorial influences of IPF on physical and mental health. The probability of poor CPAP compliance was high and could only be eliminated with intense follow-up by the CPAP clinic staff.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that CPAP therapy can improve functional outcomes in sleep quality (FOSQ) in IPF patients with OSA, although improvements in other quality of life measures (ESS, PSQI, FSS, SF-36, and BDI) were not statistically significant. However, two patients had difficulty complying with CPAP due to nocturnal cough and claustrophobia, highlighting the need for individualized approaches to CPAP initiation and acceptance in this patient population. Heated humidification may help address the common complaint of disabling nocturnal cough. Further studies with larger populations are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Income support policy may be a significant new lever for improving population health, especially that of lower-income persons. Even though the findings are robust, further analyses are needed to confirm their reliability. Future research should examine a variety of different income support policies, as well as whether a broader range of social and economic policies affect health.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program has a significant impact on reducing disability in the elderly population, particularly those with mobility limitations. An increase in SSI benefits leads to a decrease in the rate of mobility limitations among elderly individuals. The findings were robust to various sensitivity analyses."}
{"answers": "None of the clinical identifiers for early-stage adhesive capsulitis previously proposed by expert consensus have been validated in this study. Clinicians should be aware that commonly used clinical identifiers may not be applicable to this stage.", "prediction_text": "The study identified pain at the end of range of all measured active movements as the only significant clinical identifier for early-stage primary/idiopathic adhesive capsulitis. However, the lack of a recognized reference standard for diagnosing early-stage adhesive capsulitis limits the interpretation of these findings. Further research is needed to validate these results and establish more definitive diagnostic criteria."}
{"answers": "Despite current recommendations, cough and cold medicines are still used in children younger than 6 years of age. A significant portion of caregivers report that they are still unaware of public warnings, potential side effects, and interactions with other medications.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, concerns regarding the appropriate use and dosing of cough and cold medicines in young children (<6 years old) persist despite FDA warnings. The high rate of incorrect dosing demonstrates the need for continued education and monitoring in this population."}
{"answers": "Vitamin C reduces the prevalence of complex regional pain syndrome after wrist fractures. A daily dose of 500 mg for fifty days is recommended.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that vitamin C may have a protective effect against complex regional pain syndrome in elderly women with wrist fractures, with a lower prevalence of the condition observed in those receiving vitamin C supplementation compared to the placebo group. However, the study did not find a clear dose-response relationship, and larger studies are needed to confirm these findings. Additionally, early cast-related complaints were found to be a predictor of complex regional pain syndrome."}
{"answers": "The tendency to clear one's plate when eating is associated with increased body weight and may constitute a risk factor for weight gain.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that a tendency to clear one's plate when eating is positively associated with body mass index (BMI) and is an independent risk factor for obesity."}
{"answers": "ACS is common in patients with SCD who present with fever and was grossly underestimated by evaluating physicians. History and physical examination appear to be of little value in defining which febrile patients require CXR. In view of the mortality and morbidity associated with ACS, empiric CXR should be considered when evaluating a febrile patient with SCD.", "prediction_text": "The results of this study suggest that clinician assessment alone is not an accurate method for detecting acute chest syndrome in febrile patients with sickle cell disease. The use of empiric chest radiography can help identify unsuspected cases and improve overall diagnostic accuracy."}
{"answers": "We conclude that the quality of rectal cancer excision, as defined by mesorectal grades, achieved by supervised colorectal trainees is comparable with that achieved by consultants.", "prediction_text": "According to this study, there was no statistically significant difference in the quality of TME (total mesorectal excision) surgery between consultants and supervised colorectal trainees. However, it is important to note that this study had a small sample size and further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Dutch primary schools could play a more important role in fostering healthy eating habits among children. The school food policy could be improved by clearly formulating food rules, simplifying supervision of the food rules, and defining how to enforce the food rules. In addition, the school food policy will only influence children's dietary behaviour if both the school and the parents support the policy.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that while most Dutch primary schools have a written food policy, its implementation could be improved, particularly in terms of clearly defining the rules. Parents and teachers believe that both parents and schools have a role in fostering healthy eating habits, but parents have varying opinions on the enforcement of the school food policy. Therefore, there is room for improvement in the implementation and communication of the school food policy."}
{"answers": "Speed discrimination, per se, is not impaired in schizophrenia patients. The observed abnormality appears to be a consequence of impairment in generating or integrating the feedback information from eye movements. This study introduces a novel approach to motion perception studies and highlights the importance of concurrently measuring eye movements to understand interactions between these two systems; the results argue for a conceptual revision regarding motion perception abnormality in schizophrenia.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that motion perception deficits in schizophrenia may not be solely due to eye-tracking abnormalities, as eye-tracking initiation did not significantly impact motion perception thresholds in patients. However, further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between motion perception and eye-tracking in schizophrenia."}
{"answers": "(1) There is little overlap between regions of CFAEs during AF and regions of SRF measured in the time domain or the frequency domain, (2) the majority of SRF appears to occur in regions with wave-front collision, (3) the distribution of SRF is similar in patients with AF and normal controls, suggesting that this may not have an important role in AF maintenance and may not be a suitable ablation target.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant correlation or overlap between complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAEs) recorded during atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm fractionation (SRF). The distribution of SRF was similar in patients with AF and normal controls. The findings suggest that CFAEs and SRF may represent distinct phenomena. Further research is needed to understand the role of these electrograms in atrial fibrillation ablation."}
{"answers": "Continence function remained undisturbed after anastomotic leakage due to rectal resection", "prediction_text": "The results of this study suggest that anastomotic leakage does not significantly impact continence function or sphincter function in patients after curative sphincter-preserving rectal cancer surgery. However, slight decreases in maximum tolerable volume and rectal compliance were observed in patients with anastomotic leakage. Further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "No evidence was found for OPLL to have any effect on the initial neurologic status or recovery in motor function after traumatic cervical cord injury, suggesting that the neurologic outcome is not significantly dependent on canal space.", "prediction_text": "In this study, the presence of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) at the site of acute cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) did not significantly affect neurologic outcomes as measured by American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) motor score improvement rate. However, smaller static and dynamic canal diameters were observed in the OPLL+ group. Further studies with larger populations and longer follow-up periods are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Circumferences and related ratios scale significantly to height, notably after adjustment for age and race, across subjects who are representative of the US population. These observations have implications for the clinical and epidemiologic use of these anthropometric measures and indexes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, waist circumference (WC) and hip circumference (HC) scale negatively to height in adults, with WC and HC showing weaker scaling compared to weight. The scaling powers for WC and HC were 0.76-0.80 and 0.45-0.53, respectively, after adjusting for age and race."}
{"answers": "We found evidence that pain can be a significant clinical problem in psychiatric patients which seems to be underestimated in psychiatry. The investigated patients in general adult psychiatry are characterized by specific risk factors different from clinical subpopulations of other disciplines.", "prediction_text": "Yes, pain is a common and clinically relevant problem in general adult psychiatry, with a high point, 6-month, and 12-month prevalence. Depression and the number of past psychiatric hospitalizations were identified as significant risk factors. Pain can impact impairment and unfitness for work."}
{"answers": "This study found that influences on coping were multifactorial and moderated by age. These factors have implications for interventions designed to enhance coping strategies.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find evidence that age moderates the effect of personality disorder on coping style in psychiatric inpatients. Instead, age, personality traits, and social supports were found to be significant predictors of coping strategies."}
{"answers": "The study data suggests a possible correlation between cervical discopathy and cervical MS plaque.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this retrospective study suggest a significant association between the presence of cervical cord plaques and discopathy at the same site in patients with multiple sclerosis. Further research is needed to confirm these results and establish the clinical implications of this relationship."}
{"answers": "Higher MCVs and AST/ALT ratios in ASH reflect the severity of underlying liver disease and do not differentiate NASH from ASH. Instead, these biomarkers might prove useful in guiding selection of patients for liver biopsy and in targeting therapy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, routine laboratory markers such as mean corpuscular volume (MCV), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio, and sex can be useful in differentiating nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) from alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH). The MCV was elevated in ASH and normal in NASH, while an AST/ALT ratio >1 and high-grade fibrosis were more common in ASH. The multivariate analysis identified MCV, AST/ALT ratio, and sex as relevant regressors, and AST/ALT"}
{"answers": "We found no evidence that IBR compromised the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy, although there was a significant incidence of implant infection.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in the median time to chemotherapy delivery between patients who underwent immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) and those who received mastectomy alone. However, there were more complications, specifically tissue expander removals, in the IBR group. The younger age, lower BMI, and better prognoses of IBR patients may have influenced the results. Further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Economic inequalities in breast and cervical cancer screening are low in LMICs with high screening coverage. These findings are consistent with the inverse equity hypothesis and indicate that high levels of equity in cancer screening are feasible even in countries with high income inequality.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that the inverse equity hypothesis does not hold true for cancer screening in the middle-income countries examined. Instead, economic inequalities in screening coverage were lower or non-existent in countries with higher overall coverage for both breast and cervical cancer screening."}
{"answers": "Post tonsillectomy antibiotics did not prove to have a role in minimizing postoperative morbidity. Moreover, analgesics given on the basis of as required had a limited value.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this retrospective study suggest that the use of antibiotics after tonsillectomy does not have a significant impact on postoperative morbidity, including pain control, fever, secondary hemorrhage, or length of hospital stay."}
{"answers": "The study findings suggest that adopting measurement-based care, such as using the PHQ-9, is achievable, even in practices with limited resources.", "prediction_text": "The implementation of the Nine-Item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) as a routine part of depression care in psychiatric practices was found to be helpful and feasible. PHQ-9 scores significantly influenced clinical decision making, leading to treatment changes in 40% of patient contacts. The most common treatment changes were adjusting antidepressant medication dosage, adding another medication, starting or increasing psychotherapy, and switching or initiating antidepressants. Additionally, PHQ-9 scores led to increased suicide risk assessment in 3% of patient contacts. Overall, the use of patient-rated depression severity monitoring is a valuable tool in clinical psychiatry."}
{"answers": "There is no advantage to an intramedullary nail versus a sliding compression hip screw for low-energy pertrochanteric fractures AO/OTA 31-A1 and A2, specifically with its increased cost and lack of evidence to show decreased complications or improved patient outcome.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, there is no statistically significant difference in the treatment of pertrochanteric fractures between a sliding compression hip screw and an intramedullary nail, in terms of intraoperative factors, radiologic outcomes, or clinical outcomes."}
{"answers": "Just over half the patients in this present cohort may be physically able to undertake some aspects of self-managed foot care, including nail clipping and filing, callus filing and daily hygiene and inspection.", "prediction_text": "While most RA patients in this study were able to pass the sight test for self-managed foot care, a significant number failed the reach and grip tests. Older patients, longer disease duration, and higher physical disability, pain, and general health scores were associated with failure, but these differences were not statistically significant. Further research is needed to determine if modifications to the programme can help those who failed the physical tests to participate effectively."}
{"answers": "The homogeneity we found in the deprivation-mortality relationship across the regions of Scotland and the absence of a contextualized effect of region highlights the importance of taking a broader strategic policy that can combat the toxic impacts of socio-economic deprivation on health. Focusing on a few specific places (e.g. 15% of the poorest areas) to concentrate resources might be a good start but the impact of socio-economic deprivation on mortality is not restricted to a few places. A comprehensive strategy that can be sustained over time might be needed to interrupt the linkages between poverty and mortality.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the relationship between deprivation and all-cause mortality does not vary significantly between the West and the rest of Scotland, despite the presence of spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of deprivation and mortality. Deprivation remains a significant predictor of mortality in all models."}
{"answers": "This study adds to the growing body of literature documenting the importance of the individual therapist as an important factor in the change process.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that while there is some variability in the effectiveness of cognitive processing therapy (CPT) for PTSD among therapists, approximately 12% of the variability can be attributed to therapist factors. Effective therapists were identified as those who addressed patient avoidance, used effective language in supervision, had a flexible interpersonal style, and were able to develop a strong therapeutic alliance. These findings highlight the importance of proper training, supervision, and individual therapist characteristics in ensuring consistent and effective implementation of evidence-based treatments."}
{"answers": "New depression diagnosis and antidepressant use was shown to be less likely in areas of higher own-ethnic density for some, but not all, ethnic groups.", "prediction_text": "The study found that black and minority ethnic groups, including Pakistani, Indian, African, and Bangladeshi patients, were less likely to be newly diagnosed with depression or prescribed antidepressants compared to white British patients. An inverse relationship was observed between neighborhood ethnic density and new depression diagnosis for some groups, but not for black Caribbean patients, who showed an increased risk. The findings were similar for antidepressant prescribing, but the effect for black Caribbeans was no longer statistically significant."}
{"answers": "These findings suggest a malleable relationship between knee extensor strength, dynamic stability, and disease severity in PD. Although strength is only one piece of the puzzle in the functional outcome of PD, these findings may assist clinicians in designing appropriate interventions aimed at increasing function and decreasing fall risk in PD.", "prediction_text": "In patients with Parkinson's disease, knee extensor strength is positively related to dynamic postural stability and negatively related to disease severity. Dynamic postural stability is negatively related to disease severity and positively related to functional ambulation. The Functional Reach Test may be a valuable tool to assess postural stability."}
{"answers": "It is concluded that preloading colloid fluid prior to repositioning could prevent the decrease of systolic blood pressure and central venous pressure during sitting positioning without other complications.", "prediction_text": "Preloading with colloids (Haemaccel) before positioning can help maintain systolic blood pressure and central venous pressure in neurosurgical patients during seated positioning without causing significant changes in diastolic blood pressure or heart rate. However, larger studies are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Data from Safe Implementation of Treatments in Stroke-International Stroke Thrombolysis Register suggest that intravenous thrombolysis may modify the observed survival and recovery advantage for men expected in the natural course of an ischemic stroke, with a possible larger beneficial treatment effect in women when compared with men.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in functional outcome between men and women after intravenous thrombolysis for ischemic stroke, but men had a higher risk of mortality and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of sex in the response to thrombolysis."}
{"answers": "The rate of early infection without antibiotic prophylaxis before TIVAD placement in the interventional radiology suite is<1%. Based on these data, use of prophylactic antibiotics for TIVAD placement is not recommended.", "prediction_text": "Based on the data from this study, the rate of early infection for TIVADs placed without antibiotic prophylaxis was 0.6%. One patient who received an antibiotic the day of implantation developed a CLABSI. However, it is important to note that this study had a small sample size and further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotics in reducing the risk of CLABSIs in TIVAD placement."}
{"answers": "The PRP group recorded reduced pain, swelling, and trismus as well as enhanced and faster bone healing compared with those in the control. Hence the study showed that topical application of PRP gel has a beneficial effect in enhancing socket healing after third molar surgery.", "prediction_text": "The use of autologous platelet-rich plasma gel in the surgical extraction of mandibular third molars resulted in a statistically significant reduction in postoperative pain, as measured by a visual analog scale. However, there was no statistically significant difference in swelling, trismus, or radiographic healing parameters between the PRP and control groups. Further studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "This study confirms that physicians often differ from patients in the assessment of QoL. This is most likely due to a difference in patient-physician perception of \"significant\" LUTS and clearly demonstrates the importance of patient evaluated QoL in routine clinical assessment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a discrepancy between patient and physician assessment of Quality of Life (QoL) in women with lower urinary tract dysfunction, as shown by poor concordance between the two assessments and statistically significant differences in the assessment of certain domains. Physicians tended to underestimate the impact of symptoms on patients' QoL, particularly in relation to social limitations and emotions."}
{"answers": "Left ventricular dimensions are not influenced by MetS. Rather than MetS, hypertension is primarily responsible for changes in left ventricular dimensions. However, left atrial enlargement is more prominent in patients with MetS, suggesting that each MetS criterion contributes to left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the presence of metabolic syndrome in hypertensive patients is associated with increased heart dimensions, specifically a greater left atrial diameter. The correlation between left atrial diameter and the number of MetS criteria further supports this finding."}
{"answers": "A higher PV in PMR increases the risk of prolonged steroid therapy and late GCA. Female sex and particular HLA alleles may increase the risk of late GCA. Starting patients on>15 mg prednisolone is associated with a prolonged steroid duration.", "prediction_text": "Elevated plasma viscosity and high initial prednisolone dose are independent predictors of a longer duration of steroid therapy in polymyalgia rheumatica. Female sex, HLA-DRB1*0101 or -*0401 alleles, elevated plasma viscosity, and high initial prednisolone dose are potential predictors of late development of giant cell arteritis. However, no significant predictors of relapse were identified in this study."}
{"answers": "The study suggests that there is no difference in clinical toxicity profiles or survival outcomes with either definitive chemoradiotherapy or chemoradiation followed by surgery in management of locally advanced esophageal cancer.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that surgical resection following chemoradiotherapy may improve local control and reduce the risk of recurrence in patients with resectable squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. However, the study was retrospective and had a small sample size, and larger, prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings. The decision to perform surgery should be individualized based on patient factors and tumor characteristics."}
{"answers": "Our results give first evidence that lowered beta E during alcohol withdrawal may contribute to anxiety as a common disturbance during this state.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that there is an inverse relationship between beta-endorphin (beta E) levels and anxiety during alcohol withdrawal. However, it does not definitively establish that anxiety in alcoholism is based on beta E deficiency, as other factors such as corticotropin (ACTH) and cortisol levels were also found to be involved. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of beta E in anxiety during alcohol withdrawal."}
{"answers": "Increased private health care activity does not reduce the demand for NHS care: NHS and private referral rates were positively associated with each other after adjusting for age, deprivation and practice.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that private health care use is not associated with a reduction in demand for NHS care. In fact, there is evidence that areas with higher private health care use have a higher demand for NHS care. This may be due to the fact that private health care tends to be used by those who are more affluent and able to pay for it, leaving a higher proportion of those with greater health needs in the NHS system."}
{"answers": "Skewed X-inactivation is not associated with recurrent spontaneous abortion but is associated with increasing maternal age.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant association between skewed X-inactivation and recurrent spontaneous abortion. However, a small increase in mean age was observed in women with skewing of 90% or greater. Further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Findings suggest that analgesic management of daily pain is better for nursing home residents enrolled in hospice than for those not enrolled in hospice.The prescribing practices portrayed by this study reveal that many dying nursing home residents in daily pain are receiving no analgesic treatment or are receiving analgesic treatment inconsistent with AMDA and other pain management guidelines. Improving the analgesic management of pain in nursing homes is essential if high-quality end-of-life care in nursing homes is to be achieved.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that hospice residents were twice as likely as non-hospice residents to receive regular treatment for daily pain, despite a lower proportion of hospice residents receiving analgesics not recommended by AMDA. This suggests that hospice care may improve the management of pain at the end of life in nursing home residents. However, it's important to note that this is a retrospective study and further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "The continuity-of-care experiences of vascular trainees are suboptimal. This is especially true for postoperative clinic assessment. Same-day admission surgery accounted for most of the cases and was associated with the poorest continuity of care. To provide complete surgical training in an era of changing therapeutic modalities and same-day admission surgery, vascular programs must be creative in structuring training to include adequate ambulatory experience.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that residents in an academic vascular department have limited involvement in the continuity of care for their patients, with low rates of preoperative assessment, decision-making, and follow-up clinic assessments. Emergent cases and elective cases admitted before the day of surgery had higher rates of preoperative assessment and decision-making involvement. However, the overall rate of complete in-hospital continuity of care was only 57%. This indicates that there is room for improvement in the training program to ensure that residents gain comprehensive experience in all aspects of surgical care."}
{"answers": "Simple detorsion was not accompanied by an increase in morbidity, and all patients studied had functioning ovarian tissue on follow-up despite the surgeon's assessment of the degree of ovarian ischemia. Detorsion is the procedure of choice for most cases of ovarian torsion in children.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, detorsion alone appears to be a safe and effective treatment option for ovarian torsion in children, with similar postoperative complications and length of stay compared to oophorectomy. The ovary often shows normal follicular development on follow-up imaging despite intraoperative signs of ischemia. Therefore, oophorectomy may not be necessary in all cases of ovarian torsion in children. However, larger studies are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Half-dose MR angiography using diluted contrast medium injected at a rate of 1 mL/second depicted the abdominal aorta and its branches as clearly as using a full single dose.", "prediction_text": "The results of this study suggest that half-dose contrast-enhanced MR angiography may have lower signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios, but the overall image quality was not significantly different from full-dose MR angiography. Further studies with larger patient populations and more detailed evaluations are needed to determine if half-dose MR angiography is sufficient for the abdominal aorta and pelvis."}
{"answers": "There was no evidence of a trend in unsafe sex behaviour over time. However, several subgroups were identified as being more likely to report unsafe sex and should be targeted for specific interventions.", "prediction_text": "Based on the data from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study, there was no evidence of an increase in reported unsafe sex over time among HIV-infected individuals. However, certain subgroups, such as females, younger individuals, those with HIV-positive partners, and those with occasional partners, were more likely to report unsafe sex."}
{"answers": "In normal clinical practice, chemotherapy significantly prolongs survival in patients with performance status of less than 2, more time being gained if there is no associated weight loss. We conclude that the reluctance shown by many pneumologists toward using this treatment is not entirely justified.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that chemotherapy is an independent predictor of improved survival in advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma patients, as shown by a hazard ratio of 1.85 (95% CI, 1.25-2.76; P=.002). However, other factors such as absence of weight loss and ECOG score also significantly impact survival. The skepticism of pneumologists towards chemotherapy may not be fully justified, but the decision to use chemotherapy should be based on a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's individual circumstances."}
{"answers": "The Medicaid Demonstration in Florida appears to result in lower PMPM expenditures. Demonstration PSNs generated slightly greater reductions in expenditures compared to Demonstration HMOs. PSNs appear to be a promising model for delivering care to Medicaid enrollees.", "prediction_text": "The study found that provider service networks (PSNs) in Florida's Medicaid Demonstration resulted in lower per member per month (PMPM) expenditures compared to HMOs, with savings of approximately $7 per month. This was particularly true for enrollees in the SSI program. However, it's important to note that this study was conducted in two urban counties and the results may not be generalizable to other populations or geographic areas. Further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "In this series, in accordance to available testosterone, the prevalence of PADAM was determined to be high, in which the ADAM questionnaire rendered a low diagnostic efficiency. PADAM diagnosis could be clinically suspected when symptoms of sexual dysfunction are present.", "prediction_text": "The ADAM questionnaire has a moderate sensitivity (83.3%) but low specificity (19.7%) in the detection of Partial Androgen Deficiency of Aging Men (PADAM) based on the gold standard of low available testosterone levels. Item 1 (decreased sexual desire) showed better predictive value for hypogonadism. Further research is needed to improve the accuracy of the screening tool for PADAM."}
{"answers": "We found that intrapartum VAS was an effective predictor of fetal acidosis in cases of FHR variable decelerations, but its predictability for fetal acidosis in cases of FHR late decelerations was limited. Both VAS and fetal blood pH are good predictors of neonatal morbidity.", "prediction_text": "The study found that a negative response to intrapartum vibroacoustic stimulation (VAS) is associated with an increased risk of fetal acidosis (pH<7.20) during labor, with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 67% for both variable decelerations and late decelerations. However, the false negative rate of acceleration VAS response for predicting no acidosis was significantly higher in the group of late decelerations (29% vs 8%, p = 0.034). The PPV of NICU admission by a negative VAS response was two times higher than that of fetal acidosis (PPV"}
{"answers": "Emergency US fellowship programs had a positive impact on residents' US educational experiences. Emergency medicine residents performed more scans overall and also used bedside US for more advanced applications in programs with EUS fellowships.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that emergency ultrasound (EUS) fellowships may have a positive impact on emergency medicine (EM) residents' ultrasound (US) education, as evidenced by increased number of scans performed and a broader scope of bedside US applications. However, further research is needed to confirm these results."}
{"answers": "Obesity does not seem to impact the severity of injury, mortality rate, types of injury, and procedure outcomes in children. Obese patients are more likely to have rib and pelvic injuries.", "prediction_text": "Obese children have a higher injury severity score and longer hospital stays compared to non-obese children. They are more likely to have rib fractures and pelvic injuries. However, there is no significant association between obesity and mortality in pediatric trauma patients."}
{"answers": "The laparoscopic-assisted approach to Crohn's disease is feasible and safe with good outcomes. Co-morbid preoperative findings such as abscess, phlegmon, or recurrent disease at the previous ileocolic anastomosis are not contraindications to a successful laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resection in select patients.", "prediction_text": "Based on the data from this study, laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resections can be successfully performed in patients with Crohn's disease who have a history of abscesses or phlegmons, or recurrent disease at a previous ileocolic anastomosis. However, these patients may experience longer operative times, increased blood loss, and higher morbidity compared to those without these conditions. The study suggests that laparoscopic approach is still a viable option for these patients, but careful consideration and experienced surgical team is necessary."}
{"answers": "When controlling for preoperative features, the year in which RP was performed is a predictor of outcome on multivariate analysis. This effect could not be explained by stage migration.", "prediction_text": "The year of radical prostatectomy was found to be a predictor of outcome in preoperative analysis but not in postoperative analysis. The improvement in patient outcome was observed to steadily improve through the mid 1990s and then leveled off. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "The menopausal transition warrants attention as a period of vulnerability to MDD recurrence, while health factors and VMS should be considered important risk factors for first lifetime-onset of MDD during midlife.", "prediction_text": "Women with and without prior major depression had different risk profiles for major depression during midlife. Health conditions prior to baseline and during follow-ups, perception of functioning, and vasomotor symptoms were risk factors for first lifetime-onset MDD. Being peri- and post-menopausal, psychological symptoms, and a prior anxiety disorder were predominant risk factors for MDD recurrence."}
{"answers": "Most children undergoing congenital heart surgery can be extubated in the operating room. Most neonates, including many undergoing complex procedures, can be extubated within the first 24 hours after surgery. Early extubation was associated with low morbidity rates and short lengths of intensive care unit and hospital stays.", "prediction_text": "Early extubation within 24 hours of congenital heart surgery is associated with lower mortality and reintubation rates, as well as shorter lengths of ICU and hospital stays. However, not all children are candidates for early extubation, and factors such as preoperative mechanical ventilation, weight <5 kg, longer procedure time, and the need for postoperative inotrope support increase the risk of delayed extubation. Careful patient selection and monitoring are essential for successful early extubation."}
{"answers": "A significant association between farming and PSV has been identified for the first time. Results also support previously reported associations with silica, solvents, and allergy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that farming in the index year and high occupational silica, solvent, and metal exposure were significantly associated with an increased risk of primary systemic vasculitis, specifically Wegener's granulomatosis, microscopic polyangiitis, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-positive cases. Additionally, drug allergy and allergy overall were also associated with an increased risk of primary systemic vasculitis."}
{"answers": "This study that shows that adequate femoral tunnel lengths can be safely created without knee hyperflex - ion using flexible instruments via an anteromedial portal.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that flexible reamers can create femoral tunnel lengths greater than 20 mm at 90\u00b0 of knee flexion, but there is a trend for increasing distances to the common peroneal nerve with increased flexion. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and assess the clinical significance of these distances."}
{"answers": "A proportionally longer treatment duration was identified as an adverse factor in low-risk patients. Treatment breaks resulting in a NTDR of>/=33% (e.g., four or more breaks during a 40-fraction treatment, 5 d/wk) should be avoided.", "prediction_text": "Yes, prolonged treatment duration, as indicated by a higher nontreatment day ratio (NTDR), is associated with a decreased 10-year freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF) rate in men with prostate cancer, particularly in the low-risk group."}
{"answers": "TEE allowed a diagnosis of site involvement that did correlate with the anatomic diagnosis obtained during the operation. This fact contributed to the management of patients and was of great help in guiding the surgical intervention. Echo-oriented single-valve replacement may be a safe strategy for patients with PVE and double prostheses.", "prediction_text": "The findings suggest that single-valve replacement can be a safe option for patients with double prostheses and suspected prosthetic valve endocarditis, as long as the uninfected valve appears uninvolved. However, careful preoperative evaluation and accurate diagnosis are crucial to ensure the best possible outcomes. The small sample size of this study warrants further investigation with larger patient populations."}
{"answers": "Acute hepatitis C in the post universal blood products screening era was found to be predominantly an iatrogenic disease in the investigated localities. This finding should direct attention and resources towards the development and implementation of preventive measures.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that iatrogenic transmission was the most common mode of acute hepatitis C infection in Israel, accounting for 65% of cases."}
{"answers": "Our results suggest a protective effect of breast-feeding among children with a family history of atopy that is not confined to the period of breast-feeding but continues during the first three years of life. Breast-feeding should be promoted in children with a family history of atopy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, breast-feeding is associated with lower rates of illness in children with a family history of atopy, particularly in the first year of life and for respiratory and digestive tract infections, and in the following three years for respiratory and skin infections."}
{"answers": "Transrectal ultrasound guided and fusion biopsy cancer detection rates decreased with increasing prostate volume. However, magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy had a higher prostate cancer detection rate compared to that of transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy in the literature. Magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy represents a promising solution for patients with suspicion of prostate cancer and an enlarged prostate.", "prediction_text": "Magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy can improve cancer detection in enlarged prostates, particularly in those with volumes greater than 40 cc. The detection rate decreases as the prostate size increases, and smaller prostates have higher detection rates. The inverse association of magnetic resonance imaging volume with prostate cancer detection suggests that larger prostates may be more challenging to assess. However, multivariable logistic regression showed that magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy is still a valuable tool for prostate cancer detection in enlarged prostates."}
{"answers": "There is no difference in postoperative morbidity, rates of rehospitalization, in-patient mortality or hospitalization costs in geriatric patients undergoing regional or general anesthesia for repair of hip fracture. Delay in surgery beyond 3 days and ICU admission both increase cost of hospitalization.", "prediction_text": "In this retrospective cohort study, there was no significant difference in hospitalization costs, morbidity, or mortality between geriatric patients who received regional anesthesia and those who received general anesthesia for hip fracture surgery. However, delay in surgery and ICU admission were associated with increased hospitalization costs."}
{"answers": "Mesocolon invasion should be included in T4 for the staging of gastric cancer.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, direct mesocolon invasion should be considered as a distinct entity beyond T3 in the staging of gastric cancer. However, further research is needed to establish a consensus on the optimal classification and staging of mesocolon invasion in gastric cancer."}
{"answers": "Genetic variants identified in the present study may be insufficient to promote early carotid atherosclerosis.", "prediction_text": "Contrary to the observational data, this study did not find a correlation between low HDL-C levels due to genetic mutations in LCAT, ABCA1, and APOA1 and increased carotid intima-media thickness. Further research is needed to understand the complex relationship between HDL and atherosclerosis."}
{"answers": "The Turkish version of the EQ-5D-based utility score seems to be a valid instrument in the assessment of quality of life studies in patients with acute coronary syndrome.", "prediction_text": "The Turkish version of the EQ-5D demonstrates construct validity in patients with acute coronary syndrome, as evidenced by significant correlations with the MacNew heart-related quality of life scale."}
{"answers": "We found an improved survival associated with cardiologist care and a mixture of general practitioner and cardiologist care compared with general practitioner care. The pattern of outpatient care may therefore be important for the survival of patients with CHF.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that patients with congestive heart failure who received care from both general medicine and cardiology clinics had a lower risk of death compared to those who received care from only general medicine or cardiology clinics or no clinic visits. The findings were consistent in two cohorts of patients."}
{"answers": "Comparison of mother-offspring and father-offspring associations for BMI suggests that intergenerational acceleration mechanisms do not make an important contribution to levels of childhood BMI within the population. Associations at later ages and for different components of body composition now require study.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find evidence to support the hypothesis that the association of maternal body mass index (BMI) with offspring BMI is stronger than the association of paternal BMI with offspring BMI, suggesting that there may not be a significant intrauterine influence on obesity."}
{"answers": "TEE is useful to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors. An FAC less than 50% is present in 36% of potential heart donors. Because left ventricular dysfunction is often reversible shortly after transplantation, an FAC below 50% may not necessarily preclude the use of hearts for transplantation.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that heart donors with a left ventricular dysfunction (FAC < 50%) as assessed by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) can still result in successful heart transplantation. However, the long-term survival rate is lower in recipients of hearts from donors with FAC < 50% compared to those with FAC > 50%. The decision to use a heart with marginal function should be made on a case-by-case basis, considering the individual patient's clinical situation and the availability of other suitable donors."}
{"answers": "Pediatricians should be alert to the earliest manifestations of AEA. Awareness of choking games among the young and, of those, a subset who eventually progress to potentially fatal AEA is strongly encouraged among all primary care professionals who may be able to interrupt the behavior.", "prediction_text": "Autoerotic asphyxiation (AEA) is a clandestine practice involving self-induced hypoxia/anoxia for sexual excitement, which can result in unintended death. This study aims to increase pediatricians' knowledge and awareness of AEA, its manifestations, prevalence, and methods of inducing hypoxia/anoxia. Pediatricians can identify AEA, provide support, and potentially prevent tragedies. AEA is a complex biopsychosocial phenomenon, often involving a symbolic relationship with a female figure and a gamble with death. Pediatricians should be aware of the risks and signs of AEA to ensure appropriate intervention and prevention."}
{"answers": "The whole-body MRI protocol for the detection of bone metastases could safely be limited to the T1w sequence in adults, especially at 3 T. There is no need for an additional STIR sequence. These initial results will have a major impact on the department's workflow if confirmed by larger studies as they will help reduce examination time and therefore save financial resources.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, STIR imaging may not be as effective as T1-weighted sequences for the detection of bone metastases at both 1.5 T and 3 T. T1-weighted sequences showed significantly better lesion conspicuity, lesion delineation, and image quality, and a higher sensitivity for the detection of bone metastases. Therefore, STIR imaging may be considered to be omitted in the diagnostic workup of bone metastases. However, larger studies are needed to confirm these results."}
{"answers": "This study found that there was poor agreement between the AD's decision and the subsequent MR's decision regarding the fitness of those seafarers who decided to appeal against the AD's initial assessment. The reasons for this are considered.", "prediction_text": "The agreement between Approved Doctors (ADs) and Medical Referees (MRs) when assessing a seafarer's fitness was poor (Kappa K = 0.18). The disagreement was mainly due to differences in interpretation of standards and access to additional information for MRs in cases of cardiovascular diseases and mental ill-health."}
{"answers": "In our study, we suggest that glomerular hyperfiltration due to pregnancy does not have adverse effects on kidney in women with more parities. Pregnancy may have possible protective mechanisms for kidney against adverse effects of glomerular hyperfiltration.", "prediction_text": "The study found that women with four or more parities had significantly higher glomerular filtration rates (GFR) compared to women with no or one parity and those with two or three parities. However, the study did not provide evidence that this glomerular hyperfiltration during pregnancy leads to kidney damage. Further research is needed to investigate the long-term effects of this phenomenon."}
{"answers": "Implant coating with an antibacterial-loaded hydrogel reduces bacterial colonization and biofilm formation in vitro.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the antibacterial-loaded hydrogel (DAC) was able to deliver antibacterial compounds in vitro, exhibiting both bactericidal and antibiofilm effects. The hydrogel coating was also found to be resistant to press-fit implant insertion, suggesting its feasibility for intraoperative use."}
{"answers": "Location of death varies by country of birth. BAME groups are more likely to die in a hospital and less likely to die at home or in a hospice. Further investigation is needed to determine whether these differences result from patient-centred preferences, or other environment or service-related factors. This knowledge will enable strategies to be developed to improve access to relevant palliative care and related services, where necessary.", "prediction_text": "Yes, ethnicity is associated with place of death in cancer patients aged 65 and above in London. Those from Asian and African backgrounds were more likely to die in hospitals, while those from Asian and other geographical regions were less likely to die at home. The trend towards an increase in home deaths and a decrease in hospital deaths was observed across all ethnic groups, but the gap in place of death between different ethnicities remained consistent over time."}
{"answers": "Overall, 7% of women in our cohort met either clinical or molecular criteria for Lynch syndrome. All of these women had a prior history or a first-degree relative with an HNPCC-associated cancer. Limiting genetic evaluation to women with synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancer who have a family history suggestive of HNPCC may appropriately identify women with Lynch syndrome.", "prediction_text": "Among women with synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancers, those with a personal or family history of HNPCC-associated cancers had a higher likelihood of having a molecular defect (MSH2 or MLH1) consistent with Lynch syndrome. However, none of the low-risk patients had molecular findings consistent with a germline mutation. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to evaluate the utility of molecular testing in women with synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancers who do not meet Amsterdam criteria."}
{"answers": "CMV-IgM and IgG antibodies assessment was not a potential discriminative test to identify congenitally infected newborns. In addition, low birth weight and small head circumference at birth failed to predict congenital CMV infection. CMV-DNA detection in umbilical cord blood at the time of delivery using real-time PCR of all newborns is recommended as decisive, rapid and non-invasive test.", "prediction_text": "While low birth weight is not a definitive indicator of congenital cytomegalovirus infection, as evidenced by the detection of CMV-DNA in only one of the four infected newborns in this study who were below the weight limit, it may be a risk factor as a significant proportion of infected newborns in this study were below the weight limit. Further research is needed to establish the relationship between low birth weight and congenital CMV infection."}
{"answers": "The use of instrumental variables allowed us to demonstrate a significant relationship between better ambulatory process of care and better health-related quality of life. This finding underscores the importance of efforts to improve the process of care.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that better process of care in ambulatory settings is associated with smaller declines in health-related quality of life (SF-12 physical component scores) over a 30-month observation window for patients with chronic disease, even after adjusting for burden of illness."}
{"answers": "To date, the newly developed Singapore equation is the most accurate BMR prediction equation in Chinese and is applicable for use in a large BMI range including those overweight and obese.", "prediction_text": "The current prediction equations for estimating basal metabolic rate (BMR) in Chinese adults, such as Harris-Benedict, Henry, Liu, Yang, Owen, and Mifflin, have limited accuracy, especially for overweight and obese individuals. The new equation derived from this study, BMR (kJ/d) = 52.6 x weight (kg) + 828 x gender + 1960 (women = 0, men = 1), showed an accuracy rate of 78% and performed better than the existing equations for the whole range of BMI. However, for individuals with a BMI greater than 23, the new equation"}
{"answers": "This preliminary study demonstrated that OSCE ratings by LEs and REs were reasonably comparable when using checklists. Remote examination may be a feasible and acceptable way of assessing students' clinical skills, but further validity evidence will be required before it can be recommended for use in high-stakes examinations.", "prediction_text": "The results of this study suggest that remote physician-examiners can effectively assess medical students during an OSCE, with significant correlations found between on-site and remote examiner scores for history taking, physical examination, and management stations. However, the correlation for global ratings was more varied and only reached significance on three of the six stations. The acceptance of the reOSCE was high among both remote examiners and students, despite some technological issues. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to evaluate the potential benefits and limitations of remote OSCEs in medical education."}
{"answers": "ACR is an independent prognostic factor for maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes in suspected preeclampsia. ACR may be useful to inform risk predictions within a prognostic model.", "prediction_text": "A higher first urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) is an independent predictor of both maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes in women with suspected preeclampsia. A 1-unit increase in log ACR is associated with increased odds of composite adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes and reduced gestational age at delivery."}
{"answers": "The effect on venous pressures caused by the change in patient positioning alone during liver surgery does not affect the risk of venous air embolism.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find any evidence that patient positioning in a head-down tilt (Trendelenberg position) during liver surgery decreases the likelihood of a venous air embolism. The results suggest that the absolute pressures vary in a predictable way, but no negative intraluminal pressure was recorded. Further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "The observations from this study provide limited support for the possibility that occupational arsenic exposure could play a role in the development of diabetes mellitus. Many other metallic compounds are also used in art glass production, however, and there is a possibility of confounding.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests a possible association between diabetes mellitus and arsenic exposure among Swedish art glass workers, with an increased risk observed for glassblowers, foundry workers, and unspecified glassworkers. However, the findings should be interpreted with caution due to the limitations of the study design and the need for further research to confirm these results."}
{"answers": "Hospital preparedness can be better defined by a fixed number of casualties rather than a percentile of its bed capacity. Only 20% of the arriving casualties will require immediate medical treatment. Implementation of this concept may improve the utilisation of national emergency health resources both in the preparation phase and on real time.", "prediction_text": "The current Israeli hospital readiness guidelines for multiple casualty incidents based on 10% of bed capacity may not accurately reflect the actual number of casualties in HMCIs. The mean number of arriving casualties was 20.8, with only 19.8% requiring immediate medical treatment. Further research is needed to improve the prediction of surge capacity and injury severity distribution in HMCIs."}
{"answers": "While Italian primary care physicians appropriately target eradication therapy for H pylori infection in patients with peptic ulcer disease rather than nonulcer disease, the intervention was still underused in these patients. Improvements in this prescribing behavior are needed.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that primary care physicians underprescribe eradication therapy for peptic ulcer disease, particularly for those with a presumptive diagnosis. However, they overprescribe for nonulcer dyspepsia. Further research is needed to understand the reasons behind these prescribing patterns."}
{"answers": "When cerebral hemispherectomy is performed to control seizures associated with very early (in utero) insult, it has been found that the remaining right hemisphere is still able to support reading and phonological processing skills that are normally mediated by the left hemisphere. Our results also suggest the existence of variability in individuals after hemispherectomy, even within groups having the same etiology and similar timing of insult.", "prediction_text": "While some individuals who have undergone left cerebral hemispherectomy for intractable seizures show spared phonological processing abilities and develop average reading skills, the relationship between phonological processing and reading levels is not the same when mediated by the right hemisphere. The extent of reading abilities varies among individuals and is influenced by factors such as seizure onset and the degree of preservation of verbal memory and receptive vocabulary."}
{"answers": "Improved office-based practices regarding influenza vaccination could significantly impact Healthy People 2020 goals by increasing influenza vaccine uptake and reducing corresponding racial and ethnic disparities.", "prediction_text": "Yes, reducing \"missed opportunities\" for influenza vaccination in office-based settings could significantly decrease racial and ethnic disparities in adult influenza vaccination."}
{"answers": "The SPI was accurate in predicting the presence or absence of esophageal varices in patients with compensated cirrhosis.", "prediction_text": "Yes, non-invasive diagnosis of esophageal varices in patients with compensated hepatic cirrhosis is possible by duplex Doppler ultrasonography, specifically by evaluating the splenoportal index (SPI). A cut-off value of SPI at 5.0 offers the highest diagnostic accuracy, with high negative predictive value and sensitivity for ruling out esophageal varices, and high positive predictive value and specificity for identifying their presence."}
{"answers": "This study showed for the first time that RALP induces lower tissue trauma than RRP.", "prediction_text": "Based on the data from this study, robotically assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) does not appear to be less invasive than radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) as indicated by similar acute phase reactions (IL-6, CRP, and lactate) in both groups. However, it is important to note that this study only assessed inflammatory markers and not other measures of invasiveness, such as length of hospital stay, postoperative pain, or complications. Further research is needed to fully evaluate the invasiveness of these procedures."}
{"answers": "The researchers studied a defined skin care protocol using a cleanser with aloe vera and a cleansing lotion, followed by application of either a moisture barrier with silicone or skin protectant with zinc oxide and menthol, undertaken at two different frequencies. Data revealed the incidence of moderate IAD was decreased in the experimental group (receiving the skin protocol every 6 hours and p.r.n.).", "prediction_text": "Increasing the frequency of skin care from every 12 hours to every 6 hours significantly reduces the severity of incontinence-associated dermatitis in critically ill patients."}
{"answers": "Patient coaching offers promise as a means of reducing racial/ethnic disparities in pain control. Larger studies are needed to validate these findings and to explore possible mechanisms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patient coaching can help reduce racial/ethnic disparities in cancer pain control as shown in this study by eliminating the disparities in pain levels between minority and white patients."}
{"answers": "The association between plasma glucose levels and CVD risk is mainly explained by insulin resistance, which raises the question of whether glucose lowering per se without changes in the processes that underlie hyperglycemia should be the sole clinical paradigm in the treatment of type 2 diabetes or its prevention.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that insulin resistance plays a significant role in the association between hyperglycemia and cardiovascular risk. The relationship between fasting and 2-hour post-glucose load plasma glucose levels and cardiovascular risk was no longer significant after adjusting for insulin sensitivity. In contrast, insulin sensitivity remained an independent predictor of cardiovascular risk. These findings support the notion that insulin resistance is a key factor in the development of cardiovascular disease in individuals with hyperglycemia."}
{"answers": "Tracheobronchoscopy is a useful and safe procedure and should be recommended in tertiary centers for babies with EA before surgical repair.", "prediction_text": "Preoperative tracheobronchoscopy (TBS) in newborns with esophageal atresia can be clinically useful, particularly in detecting unsuspected proximal fistulas, malformations of the respiratory tree, and improving surgical approach. Its use is crucial in 24.2% of cases. However, it is not without risks and its routine use is still controversial. Further studies are needed to evaluate its benefits and risks."}
{"answers": "The recently released seventh edition of the primary tumor staging system for kidney tumors is a powerful predictor of CSS. However, some of the substages identified by the classification have overlapping prognoses, and other substages include patients with heterogeneous outcomes. The few modifications included in this edition may have not resolved the most critical issues in the previous version.", "prediction_text": "The 2009 TNM edition for primary tumor classification in kidney cancer was validated in a large multi-institutional cohort, showing that the novel classification was an independent predictor of cancer-specific survival. However, limitations include the retrospective design, lack of central pathologic review, and small number of patients in some substages. Further studies, including prospective and centralized pathologic review, are needed to confirm these findings and potentially improve the TNM staging system."}
{"answers": "The Young-Burgess system is useful for predicting transfusion requirements. For the system to predict mortality or nonorthopaedic injuries, fractures must be divided into stable (APC1, LC1) and unstable (APC2, APC3, LC2, LC3, VS, combined mechanism of injury) types. LC1 injuries are very common and not always benign (overall mortality rate, 8.2%).", "prediction_text": "The Young-Burgess classification system has limited ability to predict mortality, transfusion requirements, and non-orthopaedic injuries in patients with pelvic ring fractures. However, it can differentiate transfusion requirements and predict mortality when pelvic fractures are categorized as stable or unstable. The overall mortality rate remained unchanged over the 7-year study period."}
{"answers": "Parity is not directly linked to insulin sensitivity deterioration, to CP/FPG increase during pregnancy, or to GDM appearance, although it is linked through the mediation of progressive ageing and weight gain either before or during pregnancy, when there is a sufficiently long time interval between pregnancies.", "prediction_text": "Parity is associated with decreased insulin sensitivity during pregnancy, but this relationship is confounded by age, pregestational BMI, and weight gain. The increased risk of gestational diabetes with parity is also influenced by age and pregestational weight. The exact mechanism of how parity affects insulin sensitivity during pregnancy is not clear and requires further investigation."}
{"answers": "The relationship between cognitive functioning and recognition of frequency compressed speech-in-noise was not statistically significant. The findings may have been different if the participants had been provided with training and/or time to 'acclimatize' to the frequency-compressed conditions.", "prediction_text": "In this study, cognitive function did not significantly predict frequency compressed speech recognition in listeners with normal hearing and normal cognition. However, there was a significant reduction in speech recognition performance with increasing frequency compression ratios."}
{"answers": "We conclude that beta1Gly49 homozygosity and TACC haplotype of ADRB2 gene, both loss-of-function genetic variations, may predispose to TTN.", "prediction_text": "The study identified an association between the beta1Ser49Gly polymorphism in the ADRB gene and an increased risk for TTN in Caucasian newborns. Additionally, a significant association was found between TTN and the T-47C, A46G, C79G, and C491T (TACC) haplotype in the ADRB2 gene. These findings suggest a role for polymorphisms in the ADRB encoding genes in the development of TTN. However, further research is needed to confirm these results and establish the functional significance of these polymorphisms."}
{"answers": "MSWM does not appear to confer additional benefit as compared to the standard preoperative bariatric surgery protocol in terms of weight loss and most behavioral outcomes after LAGB in our patient population.", "prediction_text": "The results of this pilot randomized trial suggest that participation in a medically supervised weight management program does not significantly improve weight loss outcomes after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding surgery. However, a positive effect on physical activity postoperatively was observed. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "TAVI can be performed safely without balloon predilatation and with the same early results as achieved with the standard procedure including balloon predilatation. The reduction in the number of pacing periods required may be beneficial for the patient.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, it appears that balloon predilatation prior to transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVI) can be safely omitted without negatively impacting early hemodynamic results or complication rates. However, larger studies are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "In our study; sex is not a significant predictor of recanalization rate, time to recanalization or 3-month outcome in stroke patients following IV rt-PA.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find any significant difference in recanalization rates or poor 3-month outcomes between men and women receiving IV rt-PA for acute stroke, after controlling for potential confounding factors."}
{"answers": "Serum sample might be alternatively used in the difficult time of getting tumor tissue for analyzing the status of EGFR mutation status in patients with advanced NSCLC.", "prediction_text": "Serum can be used as an alternative to tumor tissue for detecting EGFR mutations in advanced NSCLC patients. The correlation between mutations detected in serum and tumor samples is high, and the presence of EGFR mutations in both serum and tumor samples is associated with a better response to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. However, overall survival does not significantly differ according to the EGFR mutation status in both serum and tumor samples."}
{"answers": "Although the provision of high-quality evidence-based resources, electronic or otherwise, is essential for standardizing care and improving patient outcomes, the authors' findings demonstrate that this alone does not ensure uptake. It is important to understand end-users, the environment in which they operate, and the basic infrastructure required to implement such a system. Implementation must also be accompanied by continuing education and endorsement to ensure both long-term sustainability and use of the system to its full potential.", "prediction_text": "Web-based systems can be effective in standardizing care and improving patient outcomes in medical oncology, but their uptake and use can be influenced by various factors including hospital location, clinician roles, experience, education, hospital policy, and infrastructure. Addressing these factors can help increase the adoption and effective use of Web-based systems in medical oncology."}
{"answers": "This study has shown that being SGA was not a significant risk factor for any stage ROP or for severe ROP in this cohort and, also, that the risk factors for ROP were similar among SGA and AGA very-low-birth-weight preterm babies.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in the prevalence of retinopathy of prematurity between preterm infants born small for gestational age and those born appropriate for gestational age. However, weight gain from birth to the sixth week of life and need for blood transfusions were identified as significant risk factors for ROP in both groups."}
{"answers": "Frequent consumption of hamburgers showed a dose-dependent association with asthma symptoms, and frequent takeaway consumption showed a similar association with BHR.", "prediction_text": "The consumption of hamburgers, particularly more than once a week, is associated with an increased risk of having a history of wheeze and current wheeze in children. However, more research is needed to confirm the relationship between takeaway food consumption and bronchial hyperresponsiveness."}
{"answers": "In patients with limb-threatening ischemia and lack of venous material for a straightforward venous femorocrural bypass, semi-closed endarterectomy of the superficial femoral artery combined with a short popliteo-crural bypass provides a good alternative.", "prediction_text": "The study reports a cumulative primary patency of 48.4% at 3 years and a limb salvage rate of 68.6% at 1 and 3 years for semi-closed endarterectomy of the superficial femoral artery combined with a short venous bypass in patients with critical leg ischemia and insufficient venous material. These results suggest that this procedure may be an acceptable alternative for limb-threatening ischemia, but further research is needed to confirm its long-term efficacy and safety."}
{"answers": "Although the SLBM is quite repeatable, it underestimates mesopic pupil size and shows a too wide range of agreement with CIP. SLBM shows low sensitivity in detecting pupils larger than 6\u00a0mm, which may be misleading when planning anterior segment surgery. Previous grading-consensus training strategies may increase interrater reproducibility, and compensation for the systematic underestimation could improve accuracy of the SLBM.", "prediction_text": "The cobalt blue light slit-lamp biomicroscopy method (SLBM) can measure mesopic pupil size, but it has lower agreement, intra- and inter-observer reproducibility, and sensitivity compared to Colvard infrared pupillometry (CIP). SLBM can detect pupils larger than 6 mm with a sensitivity ranging from 55.56% to 73.68% and specificity ranging from 76.19% to 95.45%. The best trade-off between sensitivity and specificity ranges from 5.4 mm to 6.2 mm."}
{"answers": "Although there are different patterns of atrophy across the different FTLD-TDP types, it appears that genetic and pathologic factors may also affect the patterns of atrophy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the different TDP-43 types in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) are associated with distinct patterns of brain atrophy on MRI. FTLD-TDP type 1 shows frontotemporal and parietal atrophy, type 2 predominantly anterior temporal lobe atrophy, and type 3 predominantly posterior frontal atrophy. Additionally, within the FTLD-TDP type 1 group, those with a progranulin mutation had significantly more lateral temporal lobe atrophy."}
{"answers": "A set of educational interventions designed for cancer patients significantly improved their satisfaction with information on clinical research, but did not improve clinical trial enrollment of these participants as of 1 year after the study.", "prediction_text": "The study found that increased patient awareness through educational interventions led to improved patient satisfaction with information regarding clinical trials, but did not result in a significant increase in accruals to clinical trials. The study suggests that other factors may influence a patient's decision to participate in clinical trials."}
{"answers": "There was little evidence that people at high risk of falls received systematic falls risk assessment during rehabilitation. When a risk was identified, generally a strategy was implemented. However, failure to assess some risk factors might have limited fall prevention strategies offered. Failure to adequately address risks during hospitalization could contribute to falls post-discharge. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2016; 16: 570-576.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that there is a significant gap between the identification of falls risk and the implementation of appropriate fall prevention strategies during inpatient rehabilitation and at discharge. The findings indicate that only a small proportion of patients at high falls risk had their risk factors adequately assessed and addressed with evidence-based interventions. Therefore, it appears that current practices do not fully meet the guidelines for preparing patients at high risk of falls for discharge home after rehabilitation."}
{"answers": "Although most Medicare beneficiaries who received a new CIED between 2005 and 2009 did not have an initial in-person CIED follow-up visit within 2 to 12 weeks after device implantation, the rate of initial follow-up improved appreciably over time. This CIED follow-up visit was significantly more common in white patients than in patients of other races.", "prediction_text": "The study found that while follow-up within 2 to 12 weeks of implantation increased over time, it was still suboptimal overall, with significant disparities based on race. The study also showed that follow-up within 0 to 16 weeks and 1 year were generally high but improved over time. However, the study did not directly address whether the experts' recommendations for follow-up were being fully implemented. Further research is needed to determine the reasons for the disparities in follow-up and to assess the impact of suboptimal follow-up on patient outcomes."}
{"answers": "According to our study, there is a great variability when different brands and models of scanners are compared directly. Furthermore, the CT scan analysis and HU evaluation appears to gather insufficient information in order to characterize and identify the composition of renal stones.", "prediction_text": "CT scanners may not consistently provide accurate identification of urinary stone compositions based on CT attenuation values due to significant overlaps and differences between models. The results of this study suggest that the Toshiba Aquilion and Siemens Sensation CT scanners may not be interchangeable for urinary stone composition analysis, while the Philips Brilliance and GE 64 models show more consistent results. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine the clinical implications of these differences."}
{"answers": "Ophthalmic pathology and basic science research show that SBK and ASA are improvements in excimer laser keratorefractive surgery compared to conventional LASIK or PRK, particularly with regard to maintaining corneal biomechanics and perhaps moderately reducing the risk of corneal haze. However, most of the disadvantages caused by wound healing issues remain.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings from the histologic, ultrastructural, and cohesive tensile strength evaluations, PRK, ASA, and secondarily SBK have distinct biomechanical and wound healing characteristics compared to conventional LASIK. PRK and ASA may be biomechanically safer than LASIK in reducing the risk for causing keratectasia, but they still have disadvantages due to inadequate reparative wound healing. The study suggests that PRK and ASA may be safer than LASIK in terms of keratectasia risk, but all excimer laser keratorefractive surgical techniques have limitations due to slow and incomplete healing."}
{"answers": "The Internet would be a practical and accessible way of delivering sexual health education to young people, particularly if it is incorporated into activities and websites they enjoy.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, there is potential for the Internet to be used to improve sexual health awareness among young people, with a significant number expressing interest in using a GUM website and a question line for e-mailing health care professionals. However, it should be noted that no data was collected on the actual use of the Internet for health information or sex education. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of such interventions."}
{"answers": "Ultrasound not only has comparable sensitivity to that of X-ray for the identification of limb fractures but is also equally effective for the diagnosis of fracture type and dislocation. Thus, ultrasound can be used as an adequate alternative method to X-ray for pediatric fracture diagnosis.", "prediction_text": "Ultrasound and X-ray have different strengths and limitations in pediatric fracture diagnosis. Ultrasound is superior for detecting dislocations, while X-ray is better for identifying fracture types. However, neither method is definitively superior overall, and both have limitations. The choice of imaging modality should depend on the specific clinical situation and availability of resources."}
{"answers": "Although initial infection control rate was substantially lower in the retention group than the removal group, final results were comparable at latest followup. We believe retention treatment can be selectively considered for non-S. aureus infection, and when applied in selected patients, polyethylene exchange should be performed.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, implant retention for treatment of infected TKA is associated with lower infection control rates compared to two-stage revision surgery. However, the shorter treatment duration and similar number of additional surgeries and length of hospital stay in the retention group should be considered. The presence of Staphylococcus aureus infection and polyethylene nonexchange in the retention group were identified as risk factors for failure of infection control. The decision to recommend implant retention or two-stage revision should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the individual patient's specific circumstances and infection characteristics."}
{"answers": "The observed socioeconomic, demographic and microbiological differences between unmarried and married women could be responsible for the poor pregnancy outcome among unmarried pregnant women in Poland. Unmarried pregnant women should be covered by comprehensive medical care even before pregnancy. Further studies taking into account the role of psychological stress, patterns of sexual behavior and substance abuse during pregnancy could help identify the factors responsible for adverse pregnancy outcome among unmarried pregnant women.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that unmarried pregnant women in Poland have a higher risk for bacterial vaginosis (BV) and certain pathological microflora, particularly Mycoplasma hominis. These microbiological factors may contribute to poor pregnancy outcomes observed among unmarried women, but other socioeconomic factors such as younger age, primary educational level, and poor economic situation also play a role. The study did not find a statistically significant independent association between unmarried status and BV after adjusting for age, smoking, and education. However, the higher risk of Mycoplasma hominis in unmarried women remained significant. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine the mechanisms by which these"}
{"answers": "In conclusion, concept mapping has a positive effect on students' academic achievement. These findings could provide valuable evidence for establishing concept mapping as a continuous teaching strategy for nursing students.", "prediction_text": "Yes, based on the findings of this study, concept mapping can enhance the learning outcomes of nursing students as evidenced by higher mean scores on cumulative tests compared to the traditional quiz method. Additionally, there was a gradual increase in the mean scores of developed maps during the intervention period."}
{"answers": "In this nationally representative population-based survey, HCMV seropositivity is associated with hypertension in women in the NHANES population. This association is largely explained by the association of hypertension with age and the increase in past exposure to HCMV with age.", "prediction_text": "In this study, there was a significant association between HCMV infection and hypertension in women before adjusting for confounding factors. However, after adjusting for age, the association was no longer significant. Further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Although the cost-effectiveness of a single-pill strategy was within the acceptable willingness-to-pay threshold, the QALY difference were minimal. Further research is recommended to explore the long-term impact of the strategy.", "prediction_text": "The study found that using fixed dose combination (FXD) antiretroviral therapy instead of multiple free dose combinations (FRC) resulted in higher costs but did not significantly improve quality of life (measured by SF-6D scores) in HIV/AIDS patients. However, the probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that FXD had a greater than 50% probability of being cost-effective above the $40,000 threshold per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Therefore, the use of FXD may be considered a cost-effective strategy for enhancing medication adherence and reducing pill burden in HIV/AIDS patients, despite the higher cost."}
{"answers": "2ME is able to enhance the antiproliferative activity of certain chemotherapeutics at pharmacological relevant concentrations. This estradiol metabolite is currently in a phase II trial in patients with refractary metastatic breast cancer and the tolerability has been shown to be very good. The combination of 2ME with chemotherapeutics may therefore offer a new clinically relevant treatment regimen for hormone-dependent cancer.", "prediction_text": "The combination of 2-methoxyestradiol with epirubicine and carboplatin may result in an additive inhibitory effect on the proliferation of human ovary cancer cells, potentially allowing for lower dosages of chemotherapeutics in the treatment of ovarian cancer. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and determine the optimal combination and dosages."}
{"answers": "Follow-up after endometrial cancer treatment varies in Italy. In this retrospective study, women with asymptomatic recurrence have shown a better clinical outcome compared with those with symptomatic relapse. The optimal approach is actually unknown, and guidelines comparing follow-up protocols have not been established. Prospective cost-effectiveness studies are needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, imaging modalities and scheduled clinical visits are the most common methods for detecting asymptomatic endometrial cancer relapses. However, symptoms at recurrence can significantly impact survival, with asymptomatic patients having a longer median survival time compared to symptomatic patients."}
{"answers": "Lower Infundibular height could be a good measurement tool for deciding which patients with lower calyceal lithiasis would benefit from SWL treatment. Height of less than 22 mm suggests a good outcome from lithotripsy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a higher infundibular height was significantly associated with successful clearance of lower pole calyceal stones after extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy."}
{"answers": "The interval from the onset of clinical symptoms to the initial surgical intervention seems to be the most important prognostic factor with a significant impact on outcome. Despite extensive therapeutic efforts, Fournier's gangrene remains a surgical emergency and early recognition with prompt radical debridement is the mainstays of management.", "prediction_text": "Fournier's gangrene is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition, as evidenced by the high mortality rate (36%) in the reviewed cases. Low leukocyte count upon admission was associated with survival, while high leukocyte count was associated with mortality. Further research is needed to identify other risk factors and improve outcomes."}
{"answers": "These four cases may belong to a variant form of HAM/TSP, predominantly involving the cervical cord levels.", "prediction_text": "The case series suggests that the patients presented with chronic progressive cervical myelopathy and HTLV-I infection may represent a variant form of HAM/TSP. However, further research is needed to confirm this association and to better understand the clinical and pathological features of this variant."}
{"answers": "The results of the current study demonstrated that there are factors that increase the risk of a leakage which would enable surgeons to define risk groups, to more carefully select patients, and to offer a closer follow-up during the postoperative course with early recognition and adequate treatment. All future efforts should be focused on a further reduction of serious complications to make the LSG a widely accepted and safer procedure.", "prediction_text": "The study identified several risk factors for staple line leakage in patients undergoing primary sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity, including male gender, higher BMI, concomitant sleep apnea, conversion to laparotomy, longer operation time, and the use of both buttresses and oversewing. However, only longer operation time and the year of procedure were found to be significant risk factors on multivariate analysis. The leak rate decreased significantly over the study period."}
{"answers": "Font influenced pregnant women's ratings of intervention complexity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the title and font of participant information sheets can influence pregnant women's perceptions of an antenatal intervention, specifically in terms of complexity. Further research is needed to determine if these effects impact recruitment and participation."}
{"answers": "Results of this survey highlight the wide variety of practice patterns in the US for handling surgical margins in breast-conservation treatment. This issue remains controversial, with no prevailing standard of care. Consequently, additional study is needed in the modern era of multimodality treatment to examine the minimal amount of surgical treatment necessary, in conjunction with chemotherapy and radiation, to attain adequate local control rates in breast-conservation treatment.", "prediction_text": "There is no consensus among breast surgeons regarding the most common surgical practices for attaining negative (tumor-free) surgical margins in patients undergoing breast-conservation treatment for breast cancer. Practices varied widely, including intraoperative margin analysis and acceptable margin widths."}
{"answers": "The findings showed that acupuncture of voice-related acupoints could bring about improvement in vocal function and healing of vocal fold lesions.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that both genuine and sham acupuncture resulted in improvements in vocal function and perceived quality of life, but only genuine acupuncture showed structural improvements and a reduction in the size of vocal fold lesions. However, the small sample size and lack of a placebo control limit the conclusions that can be drawn. Further research with larger sample sizes and rigorous study designs is needed to confirm the efficacy of acupuncture for treating phonotraumatic vocal pathologies."}
{"answers": "A policy of early cesarean delivery in eclampsia, carrying \u226534 weeks, is not associated with better outcomes.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a statistically significant difference in composite maternal and perinatal event rates between cesarean and vaginal delivery in women with eclampsia. However, neonatal event rate was lower in cesarean delivery but the difference was not statistically significant. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Based on data derived from self-reported health conditions, and not withstanding the limitations of such a study, we conclude that there is good evidence to suggest that individuals with moderate to severe periodontal disease are at higher risk of suffering from rheumatoid arthritis and vice versa.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant association between rheumatoid arthritis and periodontal disease, with a higher prevalence of periodontal disease observed in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis compared to those without. This association is also reflected in the higher prevalence of self-reported cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus in the rheumatoid arthritis group."}
{"answers": "Present audit shows that the process of implementation of labor analgesia was quick, successful and safe, notwithstanding the identification of one cluster of women with suboptimal response to epidural analgesia that need to be further studies, overall pregnant womens'adhesion to labor analgesia was satisfactory.", "prediction_text": "The implementation of epidural analgesia for labor increased significantly over the audit period, with high patient and caregiver satisfaction. The effectiveness of epidural analgesia, as indicated by a significant decrease in pain scores, was observed in the majority of patients. However, further research is needed to ensure that effective analgesia is reachable for all women."}
{"answers": "The residency training sites of the Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine provide patient care opportunities similar to those found in a national survey of family and general practitioners.", "prediction_text": "The patient characteristics, reasons for visits, diagnoses, services offered, and hospitalization rates at family practice residency teaching sites in northeast Ohio were similar to those reported in the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey for family physicians and general practitioners. However, preventive and therapeutic services were more frequently offered or performed, while diagnostic services were less frequently performed at the residency training sites. The mean duration of visits was similar between the two populations."}
{"answers": "Our findings suggest that, in HT+ postmenopausal women, the rs2813544 polymorphism may influence LDL-C levels and, as previously described, ESR2 rs1256049 is associated with T-chol and LDL-C. No previous study has investigated the association of this SNP set with lipoprotein levels in women while taking into account the hormonal status of the patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that certain polymorphisms in the oestrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) and oestrogen receptor 2 (ESR2) genes were associated with lipid levels (LDL-C and T-chol) in postmenopausal women receiving hormone therapy. The specific polymorphisms and haplotypes mentioned in the study (rs1801132, rs7757956, rs2813544, rs3020450, rs7154455, rs2234693, and rs4986938) were significant"}
{"answers": "The prevalence of PAD is high in nursing home residents. AAI is not predictive for IHD mortality in this population. In very frail elderly traditional risk factors and PAD are less important predictors of death compared to poor functional status, nutritional factors and previous cardiovascular disease.", "prediction_text": "The presence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) as assessed by an ankle-arm index (AAI) measurement did not predict cardiovascular mortality in older patients living in nursing homes. Other factors such as low hemoglobin values, previous cerebrovascular disease, polypharmacy, and poor mobility conditions were independently related to ischemic heart disease mortality."}
{"answers": "The data demonstrate that vaccination has a relatively weak and short-lasting effect in old age. The results of the study should stimulate discussions about strategies how vaccinations can be made more effective in old age. Improved campaigns, shortened vaccination intervals as well as the design of novel vaccines tailored to fulfill the specific demands of the aging immune system are imaginable.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that many elderly Austrians are not adequately protected against infectious diseases despite vaccination, due to both inadequate vaccination and insufficient immune response. Further research is needed to address this issue and improve vaccination strategies for the elderly population."}
{"answers": "The introduction of a discharge coordinator improved the quality of discharge planning, but at additional cost.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the introduction of a dedicated discharge coordinator led to an improved discharge planning process, fewer problems experienced by patients after discharge, and better patient satisfaction. However, there was no evidence of a more timely or effective provision of community services or improved appropriateness or efficiency of bed use."}
{"answers": "Local anesthesia is not required to lower a patient's pain intensity when applying intra-articular contrast media for MR arthrography of the shoulder. This could result in reduced costs and a reduced risk of adverse reactions, without an impact on patient comfort.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, the use of local anesthesia prior to intraarticular administration of contrast medium for MR arthrography of the shoulder does not significantly reduce pain intensity as measured by a horizontal visual analog scale. However, there was a significant difference in subjective pain perception between men and women, but no interaction effect between sex and group. Further studies with larger sample sizes and more objective measures of pain may be needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "A routinely inserted ENBD tube did not improve the clinical course, despite patients having to endure increased procedure time and discomfort, and the insertion would therefore be unnecessary.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, there is no significant difference in the recurrence rate of cholangitis or length of hospital stay between patients with choledocholithiasis-induced acute cholangitis who underwent endoscopic clearance of common bile duct stones with or without the insertion of an endoscopic nasobiliary drainage tube. However, the procedure time was longer and discomfort score was higher in the ENBD group. Therefore, the routine use of ENBD tube after endoscopic clearance of common bile duct stones in patients with choledocholithiasis-induced cholangitis cannot be recommended based on this"}
{"answers": "Regarding the pedigree, we discuss different modes of inheritance. The presence of consanguineous unions in this family suggests the possibility of a common ancestor and thus a recessive autosomal mode of inheritance.", "prediction_text": "This study suggests that there may be a hereditary factor contributing to the development of nasal polyposis in this particular family, as a higher prevalence of the condition was observed compared to the general population. However, further research is needed to confirm this finding and determine the specific genetic basis."}
{"answers": "Emergency DBE is feasible, safe and effective in acute OGIB and may avoid major surgery, diagnosing and successfully treating most patients. Combined approach with RT viewing by CE is especially useful to identify recurrent bleeding vascular lesions such as DL that may be easily misdiagnosed by non-emergency DBE.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that the combined use of emergency double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) and real-time viewing capsule endoscopy (CE) is a feasible approach for the management of acute overt-obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB). The study reports a high detection rate of Dieulafoy's lesions with emergency DBE and successful endoscopic hemostasis in the majority of cases. The use of CE with real-time viewing also led to modifications in DBE management in a significant number of patients. However, larger studies are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Laparoscopic antireflux surgery significantly improved quality of life in reflux patients whose symptoms were well controlled on medical therapy. Although on the basis of a noncomparative trial with a relatively short follow-up period, we believe such patients should be considered for laparoscopic antireflux surgery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, according to this retrospective study, laparoscopic antireflux surgery can lead to improved quality of life in patients with well-controlled gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, as indicated by significant improvements in physical and mental composite scores on the Short Form 36 questionnaire, total scores on the Psychological General Well-Being index, and overall gastrointestinal symptom scores, including reflux symptoms."}
{"answers": "Patients in regional and rural settings were willing partners in developing skills of junior medical students, who had greater involvement in patient consultations than previously reported for urban students. Our study extends the findings from urban general practice that patients are underutilised partners in community-based medical training. The support of patients from regional and rural settings could facilitate the expansion of primary care-based medical education in these areas of workforce need.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that patients in regional and rural Australia are generally positive and willing participants in community-based medical education, with a majority expressing support for their doctor and practice being involved in student teaching. Patients also reported feeling they played an important role and would have accepted higher levels of student involvement than actually occurred."}
{"answers": "Overall, in a US Air Force population, OSA does not predict a decrease in aerobic fitness as measured by cycle ergometry. However, patients with an apnea-hypopnea index of greater than 20 have a statistically significant decrease in aerobic fitness compared to the normal population. This study demonstrates the effects of OSA on aerobic fitness. Further correlation of fitness testing results with OSA severity and treatment is needed.", "prediction_text": "Patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) generally have higher aerobic fitness levels as measured by VO2max compared to the normal population. However, those with severe OSA (apnea-hypopnea index > 20) have lower aerobic fitness levels. Treatment of OSA with medical or surgical methods does not appear to affect aerobic fitness."}
{"answers": "Pictorial HWLs with didactic textual forms seem to work better than those with testimonial narratives. Future research should determine which pictorial HWL content has the greatest real-world impact among consumers from disadvantaged groups, including assessment of how HWL content should change to maintain its impact as tobacco control environments strengthen and consumer awareness of smoking-related risks increases.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that didactic pictorial warning labels with images of diseased organs are more effective in increasing credibility, relevance, and impact on smokers, especially those with higher educational attainment. However, more research is needed to determine if these labels can effectively address smoking-related health disparities."}
{"answers": "Preferential transmission of AVPR1A to hypersexual or uninhibited people-seeking probands was not supported.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant association between the number of arginine vasopressin V1a receptor (AVPR1A) microsatellite repeats and hypersexuality in children with a prepubertal and early adolescent bipolar disorder phenotype. The study was underpowered to detect smaller effect sizes. Further research is needed to explore the potential role of AVPR1A microsatellites in the development of hypersexuality in this population."}
{"answers": "We suggest that regardless of family history, all children over 5 years should be screened for hyperlipidemia. Education about hyperlipidemia and precautions for its complications should be given to both children and families. The best and easiest way to reach children is to screen them at schools. School is also a good place for education of children about hyperlipidemia and risk factors.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant association between family history of hyperlipidemia and serum lipid levels in school children. Therefore, relying solely on family history may not be a reliable method for identifying children who require cholesterol screening. Other factors or additional screening methods should be considered."}
{"answers": "These data indicate digoxin use may be associated with a reduction in risk of PCa. Given the potential mechanisms by which digoxin may exert an anti-neoplastic effect and other recent studies showing a negative association between digoxin use and PCa, further research is warranted.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that digoxin use may be associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer, particularly in men with frequent PSA tests. However, the findings should be interpreted with caution due to the observational nature of the study and the need for further research to confirm these results."}
{"answers": "GHD men receiving GH treatment have a mortality rate not different from the background population. In women, after exclusion of high-risk patients, mortality was not different from the background population except for CVD. Mortality due to malignancies was not elevated in adults receiving GH treatment. Next to gender, the heterogeneous etiology is of influence on mortality in GHD adults with GH treatment.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that growth hormone replacement therapy in adults with growth hormone deficiency is associated with a higher all-cause mortality rate, but the effect on cause-specific mortality remains unclear. Factors such as sex, GHD onset, age, and underlying diagnosis may influence mortality in this population. Further research is needed to establish the effect of GH treatment on mortality."}
{"answers": "It seems quite admissible and justified to encourage medical students to officiate as examiners in undergraduate emergency medicine OSCE formative testing, but not necessarily in summative assessment evaluations.", "prediction_text": "Student examiners can be reasonable substitutes for faculty examiners in an undergraduate OSCE on medical emergencies, as they can effectively assess examinee performance and provide similar post-assessment evaluations, although with small effect sizes. However, the use of both student and faculty examiners may offer advantages in terms of providing diverse perspectives and opportunities for learning."}
{"answers": "Expression of ER is a constitutional feature of the connective tissue and smooth muscle cells of the anal continence organ. Estrogen receptors and PR are not detectable in the striated muscle fibers of the external anal sphincter in either sex. The presence of ER in the stroma and smooth muscles of the anal canal suggests that these tissues are targets for estrogen. This constitutes a theoretical basis for the beneficial effects of estrogen and progestin replacement on anal continence in postmenopausal women.", "prediction_text": "The presence of estrogen and progesterone receptors in the anal canal tissues, particularly in the internal sphincter and perimuscular connective tissue of females, suggests a potential hormonal influence on anal continence in women. Further research is needed to understand the role of these hormones in anal incontinence and how they may be targeted for potential treatments."}
{"answers": "In women with bothersome MUI, concomitant AA repair does not result in additional improvement in OAB symptoms over MUS alone. Patients with postoperative complications exhibit less improvement in OAB symptoms.", "prediction_text": "The results of this retrospective cohort study did not show a significant difference in the improvement of overactive bladder symptoms between women undergoing midurethral sling alone and those undergoing concomitant midurethral sling and anterior/apical repair. However, women with postoperative complications had lower improvements in overactive bladder symptoms. Further studies with larger populations and more rigorous designs are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "An association was found between sublingual varices and hypertension. Examining the lateral borders of the tongue is easily done, causes no harm and could be a valuable method for the dental profession to take active part in preventive healthcare.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found a significant association between the presence of sublingual varices and hypertension. Patients with sublingual varices had a higher prevalence of hypertension and higher mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared to those without varices. The positive predictive value of sublingual varices for hypertension was 0.5, and the negative predictive value was 0.80."}
{"answers": "Our data suggested that visually impaired pedestrians can make accurate and reliable street crossing decisions like those of normally sighted pedestrians. When using auditory information only, all subjects significantly overestimated the vehicular gap time. Our finding that blind pedestrians performed significantly worse than either the normally sighted or visually impaired subjects under the hearing only condition suggested that they may benefit from training to improve their detection ability and/or interpretation of vehicular gap times.", "prediction_text": "Normally sighted and visually impaired pedestrians are accurate and reliable in making street crossing decisions using both visual and auditory information. However, under auditory-only conditions, all subjects were reliable but less accurate, with blind subjects being the least accurate compared to the other two groups."}
{"answers": "Initial single scrotal incision can be recommended for orchidopexy, even in the more difficult cases of impalpable undescended testes. Advantages seem to include shorter operative time, a cosmetically appealing single incision, and possibly less pain. The scrotal incision technique significantly reduces the need for laparoscopy in impalpable testes. Surprisingly, it even allows successful orchidopexy of abdominal testes, provided an open processus is present.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, a scrotal approach to both palpable and impalpable undescended testes can be considered a viable first choice, as it allows for easy detection and treatment of atrophic testes or testicular remnants, and has a low rate of complications. However, further studies with larger populations are needed to confirm these results."}
{"answers": "Center differences in enteral feeding advancement occur and may have a significant impact on short-term outcomes such as nosocomial sepsis. Large, multicenter, prospective trials are required to further elucidate the optimal feeding strategy for VLBW infants.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that rapid enteral feeding advancement in very low birth weight infants is associated with a lower rate of sepsis, fewer central venous lines, and less antibiotic use compared to slow advancement. However, more research is needed to determine the long-term effects on neurodevelopment and growth."}
{"answers": "There appears to be no difference in the numbers of emboli detected when the first vascular clamp is applied to the proximal aorta or iliacs.", "prediction_text": "The sequence of clamp application during open abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery did not significantly influence distal embolisation based on the number of emboli detected with Transcranial Doppler ultrasound. However, current smoking was associated with a higher number of emboli."}
{"answers": "GP hospitals seem to reduce the utilisation of general hospitals with respect to admissions as well as occupied bed days.", "prediction_text": "Yes, populations with access to general practitioner hospitals (GP hospitals) have lower rates of admissions and occupied bed days in general hospitals compared to those without such access. This effect is most pronounced for patients with respiratory diseases, cardiac failure, cancer, stroke, and fractures."}
{"answers": "The EBP unit was associated with better patient outcomes and more efficient performance than achieved by the same physicians previously or by SP concurrently.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the implementation of an Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) unit in a hospital led to significant improvements in patient outcomes, including a lower mortality rate and shorter length of stay, compared to standard practice (SP) patients. However, it's important to note that the study design was a natural experiment and the results should be interpreted with caution. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and establish a causal relationship between EBP and improved patient outcomes."}
{"answers": "Although travel burden is associated with timely diagnosis and treatment for some types of cancer, we did not find evidence that driving time was, in general, better at predicting timeliness of cancer diagnosis and treatment than driving distance. More intensive efforts at early detection of breast cancer and early treatment of CRC for Medicaid patients who live in remote areas may be needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that longer driving distances and times to reach a provider are associated with later stage at diagnosis and longer time-to-treatment for breast cancer and colorectal cancer Medicaid patients. This suggests that distance to provider is a significant barrier to care for these patient populations."}
{"answers": "Our results indicate that training managers in transformational leadership behaviours may have a positive impact on healthcare workers' health over time. However, more research is needed to examine the mechanisms by which transformational leadership brings about improved sleep quality; self-efficacy was not found to be the explanation.", "prediction_text": "The results of this study do not support the hypothesis that self-efficacy mediates the relationship between transformational leadership behaviors and healthcare workers' sleep quality. The relationship between leadership and sleep quality was found to be direct and independent of self-efficacy."}
{"answers": "The use of US helps in making a correct diagnosis and in the follow-up with objective criteria and also convinces the patient and the family that the treatment needs to be continued.", "prediction_text": "Ultrasound can be a useful objective tool in diagnosing constipation in children, particularly in determining rectal diameter and fecal load. The results are reproducible and can help monitor response to treatment. The cutoff point for rectal diameter for diagnosing constipation is 2.44 cm, and rectal diameter, rectal anterior wall thickness, and fecal load are higher in constipated patients. However, normal rectal diameter may not be reached after treatment despite a decrease in constipation score and fecal load."}
{"answers": "Brachytherapy with ruthenium applicators is an effective therapy for small- and medium-size posterior uveal melanomas. Our results are comparable to other series. The treatment outcome does not seem to be capable of improvement by increasing the apical dose. An internationally accepted model for defining the dosage in brachytherapy is needed.", "prediction_text": "The literature suggests that both 100 Gy and 160 Gy apical doses are effective in treating posterior uveal melanomas with 106Ru plaque beta-ray radiotherapy. However, the present study did not find a significant difference in treatment outcome between the two doses. The overall and disease-specific 5-year survival rates were high, and local control was achieved in 90% of the patients. The main side effects were retinopathy and macular degeneration or scarring, which led to poor central vision in some cases. The choice of apical dose should be based on individual patient factors and the risk of side effects."}
{"answers": "The addition of epinephrine to ACLS-SAPO increases vital organ perfusion pressures and improves outcome from cardiac arrest. There appears to be a profound loss of arterial vasomotor tone after prolonged arrest. This loss of vasomotor tone may make exogenous pressors necessary for resuscitation after prolonged cardiac arrest.", "prediction_text": "The use of exogenous epinephrine during aortic perfusion and oxygenation therapy (SAPO) for cardiac arrest appears to improve both aortic and coronary perfusion pressures, and is associated with a higher rate of return of spontaneous circulation. Therefore, epinephrine may be considered necessary during SAPO therapy. However, further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "In a leading specialty journal, cited reviewers gave higher scores than noncited reviewers. However, this\u00a0was likely due to their being assigned higher-quality manuscripts and not because they were cited in the manuscript. Reviewer requests that their work be cited were rare.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that reviewers may give slightly higher scores to manuscripts that cite their work, but the effect was small and may be confounded by the overall quality of the manuscript. The study also found that reviewers suggested adding citations to their work in only a small percentage of cases. However, the study had some limitations, including the retrospective design and the relatively small number of cited reviews. Further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Preoperative education delivered by nurses reduced anxiety and postoperative complications of patients undergoing cardiac surgery, but it was not effective in reducing readmissions or length of stay.", "prediction_text": "Yes, nurse-led preoperative education can reduce anxiety in cardiac surgery patients and may also lead to a lower incidence of chest infections. However, no significant difference in length of stay or readmission was found."}
{"answers": "Improving hospital efficiency by shortening length of stay does not appear to result in increased rates of readmission or numbers of physician visits within 30 days after discharge from hospital. Research is needed to identify optimal lengths of stay and expected readmission rates.", "prediction_text": "The study found that decreasing lengths of stay over time for selected diagnostic categories did not consistently correlate with increased readmission rates or mean number of physician visits after discharge. However, the readmission rate for uterine or adnexal procedures increased significantly in the second year after the decrease in length of stay. No correlation was found between length of stay and readmission rates or mean number of physician visits for individual hospitals in the studied categories. The findings suggest that shorter lengths of stay do not necessarily adversely affect quality of care, but further research is needed to confirm these results."}
{"answers": "Solitary kidney in a canine model is more resistant to ischemia than paired kidneys based on radiological, pathological and genetic evidence.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that a solitary kidney is not more resistant to ischemia compared to a paired kidney. In fact, the solitary kidney may experience more severe damage and longer recovery time. However, it is important to note that this study was conducted in dogs and further research is needed to confirm these findings in humans."}
{"answers": "Elective re-siting of intravenous cannulae every 48 hours results in a significant reduction in the incidence and severity of PVT. We recommend that this should be adopted as standard practice in managing all patients who require prolonged intravenous therapy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, elective re-siting of intravenous cannulas every 48 hours significantly decreases the incidence and severity of peripheral thrombophlebitis compared to leaving cannulas in place until complications occur. The study showed a 90.5% reduction in the incidence of PVT in the study group compared to the control group. The majority of PVT episodes occurred on day 3 in the control group."}
{"answers": "We conclude that 3-phase bone scintigraphy prior to surgery could be a useful method to determine the amputation level in a diabetic foot. We conclude that further, comparative, more comprehensive, long-term, and controlled studies are required.", "prediction_text": "The use of 3-phase bone scintigraphy in determining amputation levels in diabetic foot can potentially reduce cost, morbidity, and mortality, as well as reamputation rates and hospitalization duration. However, it should be noted that this study was based on a small sample size and further research is needed to confirm these findings. The method is not yet a definitive guideline but can be considered as an adjunctive tool in the decision-making process for amputation levels in diabetic foot."}
{"answers": "At baseline assessment patients of lower socioeconomic status showed lower health related quality of life. Since there was no clear trend at follow-up assessment this suggests that patients from different socioeconomic status responded to treatment similarly. In general, the findings suggest that quality of life is not only the outcome of the disease and its treatment, but is also highly dependent on each patients' socioeconomic characteristics.", "prediction_text": "At baseline, patients of lower socioeconomic status had poorer quality of life in various domains compared to affluent patients. However, no significant differences were observed between the two groups at the three-month follow-up assessment."}
{"answers": "General surgery research residents' intraoperative leadership skills showed significant correlations to their perceptions of skill decay and task difficulty during a bowel repair. Evaluating resident's directional instructions may provide an additional individualized intraoperative assessment metric. Further evaluation relating to operative performance outcomes is warranted.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that there is a relationship between a resident's self-perceived technical skills and their use of assistant instructions during a simulated small bowel repair. Those who rated lower self-efficacy in their technical skills tended to give more instructions to their assistants, and also perceived the task as less difficult. However, further research is needed to confirm this relationship in real-life surgical settings."}
{"answers": "The severity of TAI is influenced by the sharpness of the aortic arch. There is an inverse relationship between the severity of aortic injury and the aortic arch index.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the anatomy of the aortic arch, specifically the aortic arch angle, is significantly associated with the severity of traumatic aortic injury, particularly type III damage."}
{"answers": "Clinical variables, either isolated or as components of a model, could not identify all children with pathologic radiographs.", "prediction_text": "The study found that pretreatment oxygen saturation was the only significant difference between children with pathologic and nonpathologic radiographs during their first episode of wheezing. However, the discriminant analysis had limited ability to predict pathologic radiographs, correctly identifying only 15% of such cases. Therefore, clinical variables alone are not reliable in predicting pathologic radiographs in the first episode of wheezing."}
{"answers": "The results showed no overall first night effect on severity of RMMA frequency in young and healthy patients with SB. In clinical practice, one-night sleep recording may be sufficient for moderate-high frequency SB patients. However, low RMMA frequency in the first night could be confirmed by a second night based on the patient's medical and dental history.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that sleep bruxism (SB) may exhibit increased jaw muscle activity on the second night, with more frequent bursts and longer burst durations, but no difference in episode frequency. This finding may have implications for the diagnosis and management of SB. Further research is needed to confirm these results and to understand the underlying mechanisms."}
{"answers": "Athletes engaged in competitive sports are more likely to develop ventricular arrhythmias during exercise. These arrhythmias subside over time when athletes are engaged in non-competitive sports.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that athletes with ventricular arrhythmias during exercise tests may experience a reduction in arrhythmias over time. However, the small sample size and lack of a representative control group limit the generalizability of these findings. Further research is needed to confirm these results and determine the long-term outcomes for athletes with ventricular arrhythmias."}
{"answers": "A well developed collateral circulation does not predict an increased risk of restenosis after PCI.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant association between the presence of well-developed collateral circulation and the risk of restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention. Other factors, such as stent diameter, stent length, residual stenosis, and smoking history, were found to be predictive of restenosis."}
{"answers": "We conclude that patient and graft survival on transplanting kidneys from elderly donors to young recipients is superimposable on that obtained with young donors. However, renal function is better in the group of young donors.", "prediction_text": "The 10-year follow-up study did not show significant differences in patient or graft survival between elderly donor kidneys implanted in young recipients and younger donor kidneys. However, there was a significant difference in creatinine levels at 1, 5, and 10 years, with higher levels in the elderly donor group. The decision to use kidneys from elderly donors in young recipients should be individualized, taking into account the potential for increased long-term renal function decline. Further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Many patients do not understand their ED care or their discharge instructions. Moreover, most patients appear to be unaware of their lack of understanding and report inappropriate confidence in their comprehension and recall.", "prediction_text": "No, many patients with deficient comprehension of their ED care and instructions were not aware of it. The study found that over half of the patients had deficiencies in understanding 2 or more domains, with the majority of these deficiencies being related to post-ED care."}
{"answers": "The results of this study suggest that normothermic CPB does not prevent the development of the \"euthyroid sick syndrome\" during and after CPB. Despite these changes in thyroid function, most patients in both groups had a normal postoperative recovery.", "prediction_text": "The results of this study suggest that hypothermic and normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass both result in transient changes in thyroid function, including decreased TT4, TT3, and free T3 levels and increased rT3 levels, in the perioperative and postoperative periods. These findings do not support the hypothesis that cardiopulmonary bypass temperature has no effect on postoperative euthyroid sick syndrome."}
{"answers": "Severe hypoglycaemia is associated with an increased risk for CV outcomes in people at high CV risk and dysglycaemia. Although allocation to insulin glargine vs. standard care was associated with an increased risk of severe and non-severe hypoglycaemia, the relative risk of CV outcomes with hypoglycaemia was lower with insulin glargine-based glucose-lowering therapy than with the standard glycaemic control. Trial Registration (ORIGIN ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00069784).", "prediction_text": "Severe hypoglycaemia, but not non-severe hypoglycaemia, is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, mortality, CV death, and arrhythmic death. The ORIGIN trial suggests that severe hypoglycaemia may be more common with standard glycaemic care than insulin glargine."}
{"answers": "EDWS is a safe and effective treatment for esophagogastric varices secondary to portal hypertension in selected patients. Patients treated with EDWS had a lower complication rate of portal venous system thrombosis compared with those treated with conventional MED.", "prediction_text": "Esophagogastric devascularization without splenectomy (EDWS) is a safe and effective alternative to modified esophagogastric devascularization (MED) with splenectomy for the treatment of portal hypertension. EDWS is associated with a lower morbidity rate of portal venous system thrombosis and similar recurrence rates of esophagogastric variceal hemorrhage. However, larger studies are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Significant postoperative pain can be expected in the following situations: pain after prior surgery, presence of chronic pain sustained for more than six months, intense preoperative pain, state of depression.", "prediction_text": "Yes, based on the findings of this study, a prior history of surgical pain, duration of prior pain, intensity of preoperative pain, and depression can be used as predictors of significant postoperative pain. However, it is important to note that this study was conducted on a relatively small sample size and further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "The general practice selection process is predictive of future performance in the MRCGP.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a statistically significant correlation between general practice selection scores and performance in the MRCGP examinations, specifically for the applied knowledge test (AKT) and clinical skills assessment (CSA) elements."}
{"answers": "Although the association of prostate and lung cancer is uncommon, the possibility of synchronous tumors should be considered in patients with urinary and pulmonary symptoms suggestive of neoplasm. It is important to determine if the lesion is a metastasis, since the prognosis depends on the second tumor.", "prediction_text": "Prostate cancer and lung cancer are distinct diseases, and the occurrence of both in the same patient is an uncommon association. The presentation of these tumors, including their characteristics and stages, can vary widely. The presence of a pleural effusion does not indicate that the patient has a different disease from prostate cancer."}
{"answers": "The practice of intensive observation for the first transfusion in pediatric patients is probably unnecessary.", "prediction_text": "Based on the data from this study, intensive monitoring during the first transfusion in pediatric patients is not necessary for the majority of patients, as only mild reactions occurred during the first transfusion and none required ICU management. However, severe reactions can still occur during subsequent transfusions and close monitoring should be maintained for high-risk patients."}
{"answers": "There is no indication of a rebound aggravation of symptoms 12 to 14 days after a 5-day treatment with lansoprazole 60 mg once daily in patients with reflux symptoms.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that short-term treatment with lansoprazole may lead to a rebound aggravation of symptoms, as indicated by higher symptom scores during the placebo period after the treatment period. However, the differences in symptom scores were not statistically significant. Further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Our long-term study showed significantly better (2-fold) results regarding the continence score for the abdominal approach compared with the transanal pull-through. The stool pattern and enterocolitis scores were somewhat better for the TERPT group. These findings raise an important issue about the current surgical management of HD; however, more cases will need to be studied before a definitive conclusion can be drawn.", "prediction_text": "The study found that while there were no significant differences in overall long-term outcomes between transanal endorectal pull-through (TERPT) and conventional transabdominal pull-through (ABD) for Hirschsprung disease, continence was significantly better in the ABD group and stool pattern was better in the TERPT group. However, the age difference between the two groups at the time of interview may have influenced the results, and further studies with larger sample sizes and more rigorous controls are needed to definitively answer this question."}
{"answers": "The current study revealed an increase in health care services utilization from 2001 to 2009 in the older Spanish population.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the prevalence of health care services use, specifically general practitioner visits, increased significantly among elderly people (women: OR 1.43, 1.27-1.61; men: OR 1.71, 1.49-1.97) between the years 2001 and 2009. However, men had a higher probability of hospitalization than women even after adjusting for confounders (OR 1.53, 1.39-1.69). Factors such as lower educational level, worse self-rated health, chronic conditions, polypharmacy, and level of disability were also independently associated with"}
{"answers": "It is concluded from the study that this knowledge if applied to dead human subjects, may preserve dead bodies temporarily allowing delayed funeral.", "prediction_text": "Yes, Raksi, a homemade alcohol, can temporarily preserve dead bodies due to its preservative, bactericidal, and disinfectant properties. It can arrest postmortem changes for up to 72 hours. However, more research is needed to determine its long-term effectiveness and safety for human use as an embalming agent."}
{"answers": "The Holmium:YAG laser is an ideal intracorporeal lithotripter for ureteral calculi, with a high success rate and low morbidity.", "prediction_text": "The holmium:YAG laser is an effective and relatively safe modality for the treatment of ureteral stones, with a high success rate and low complication rate. However, more studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods are needed to confirm these findings and to compare it to other intracorporeal lithotripters."}
{"answers": "Our results suggested that s.c. anti-TNF pharmacokinetics do not significantly influence US-scored synovitis in RA patients.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant correlation between the ultrasound-scored synovitis and the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous anti-TNF agents in patients with rheumatoid arthritis."}
