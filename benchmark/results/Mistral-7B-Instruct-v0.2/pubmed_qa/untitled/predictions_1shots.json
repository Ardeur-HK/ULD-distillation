{"answers": "These data suggest that being willing and fit enough for a chemotherapy protocol is a good prognostic factor for invasive bladder cancer. This eligibility bias emphasizes the need for prospective, randomized trials, and indicates that single-group studies using historical or matched controls have to be interpreted with caution.", "prediction_text": "The results of this study suggest that eligibility for a chemotherapy protocol after radical cystectomy for invasive bladder cancer is not associated with a good prognosis. The patients in the chemotherapy group had a shorter median overall and recurrence-free survival, as well as a higher rate of tumor progression and cancer-related death, compared to the non-chemotherapy groups."}
{"answers": "An additional delayed phase through the abdomen in routine contrast-enhanced CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis is of low yield, particularly if reliable follow-up imaging to further elucidate uncertain findings is available.", "prediction_text": "Delayed imaging in routine CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis can lead to the detection of incidental findings in a small percentage of patients, but it also results in a significant increase in radiation exposure and cost. The benefits should be weighed against the risks and additional resources required."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that the SCL 90-R is best viewed as an indicator of unidimensional emotional distress and somatic effects of structural brain injury.", "prediction_text": "The SCL 90-R Obsessive-Compulsive subscale is not directly related to objective measures of attention and verbal memory in individuals with brain tumors. However, it is significantly correlated with symptoms of depression, anxiety, and subjective complaints of memory problems. Therefore, it may identify psychological distress related to cognitive impairments rather than the cognitive impairments themselves."}
{"answers": "The results suggest that NA treatment can be stopped in selected patients with CHB as long as they are not cirrhotic, have completed a minimum period of treatment, have normal ALT and sustained undetectable DNA. These patients should be closely monitored during the first year and then indefinitely.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that in selected patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B and normal liver function tests, undetectable HBV DNA, absence of cirrhosis or significant comorbidities, discontinuing nucleos(t)ide analog therapy may result in virological relapse in about half of the cases within the first year. The mean time to relapse was around 6 months. Therefore, careful monitoring is necessary for those considering discontinuation."}
{"answers": "The results of this study do not support the hypothesis that there is a direct link between atmospheric pressure values and abdominal aortic aneurysm ruptures.", "prediction_text": "The diameter of an abdominal aortic aneurysm is a more significant predictor of rupture than atmospheric pressure. Contradictory results have been reported regarding the relationship between atmospheric pressure and aneurysm size, but this study did not find a statistically significant correlation between the two. The highest frequency of ruptures occurred during winter and spring, when atmospheric pressure is highest, but this observation was not statistically confirmed. A non-significant trend towards higher rupture rates in larger aneurysms (>7 cm) was observed when pressure increased between the day before and the day of rupture, particularly in patients with hypertension."}
{"answers": "Findings from these studies support discordance between device-recorded and self-reported hot flashes. In addition, the studies reveal further limitations of SSC monitoring, including difficulties with data collection and lack of consistency in interpretation. Based on these results and other recent trials identifying issues with SSC methodology, it is time to find a better physiologic surrogate measure for hot flashes.", "prediction_text": "The second prototype of the sternal skin conductance (SSC) device showed a 24% concordance rate between self-reported and device-recorded hot flashes, indicating limited accuracy as a surrogate for hot flash measurement. However, the device was reported as acceptable by most women despite some interference with daily activities."}
{"answers": ": Prophylactic fixation with a cephalomedullary nail was not found to be cost-effective for the average older woman who sustained a hip fracture. However, it may be appropriate for select patient populations. The study supports the need for basic science and clinical trials investigating the effectiveness of prophylactic fixation for patient populations at higher lifetime risk for contralateral hip fracture.", "prediction_text": "Prophylactic fixation of the uninjured hip can be a cost-effective method to prevent contralateral hip fractures in certain patient populations, specifically women aged 71 to 75 years old with a 30% greater relative risk for a contralateral fracture, and women younger than age 70 years. However, the cost-effectiveness of the procedure is highly dependent on the additional costs of the procedure and its effectiveness in preventing contralateral fractures."}
{"answers": "We found that USMLE Step 2, number of honors in medical school clerkships, and AOA membership demonstrated the strongest correlations with resident performance. Our goal in analyzing these data was to provide residency programs at large a sense of which criteria may be \"high yield\" in ranking applicants by analyzing data from within our own pool of residents. Similar studies across a broader scope of programs are warranted to confirm applicability of our findings. The continually emerging complexities of the field of orthopaedic surgery lend increasing importance to future work on the appropriate selection and training of orthopaedic residents.", "prediction_text": "Preresidency selection factors such as USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 scores, Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) scores, number of clinical clerkship honors, and Alpha Omega Alpha (AOA) honor medical society membership have a moderate to weak correlation with objective measures of resident performance in orthopaedic surgery residency, including American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery (ABOS) Part I scores and Orthopaedics In-Training Exam (OITE) scores. AOA membership is also associated with higher subjective ratings by faculty, particularly in the areas of interpersonal and communication skills."}
{"answers": "In vitro fertilization outcome is strongly correlated with both maternal ages, basal cycle, day 3 follicle, stimulated hormone, and antral follicle assessment. Antral follicle assessment was a better predictor of in vitro fertilization outcome than were age or follicle stimulated hormone. Antral follicle assessment may provide a marker for ovarian age that is distinct from chronological age or hormonal markers.", "prediction_text": "Antral follicle assessment at baseline can provide additional predictive value beyond age and basal FSH levels in predicting the outcome of in vitro fertilization (IVF). The presence of more antral follicles (>6) is associated with a higher clinical pregnancy rate and lower cancellation rate compared to fewer follicles (\u22646)."}
{"answers": "Neither insertion of PEG tubes nor timing of insertion affect survival.", "prediction_text": "The results of this study suggest that feeding tube insertion does not improve survival in advanced cognitive impairment patients with new eating problems, and the timing of tube insertion did not affect survival after adjusting for selection bias."}
{"answers": "In this well established early discharge program with nurse home visits, newborn metabolic screening is not compromised by early discharge.", "prediction_text": "Early discharge of newborns is associated with a higher rate of inadequate initial filter paper specimens but a higher rate of repeat specimens and a greater likelihood of having an adequate specimen within the first 9 days of life compared to traditional stay infants. The study does not directly mention nurse home visits in relation to the adequacy of newborn metabolic screening."}
{"answers": "The palliative treatment concept of 25\u00a0Gy applied in 5\u00a0fractions is sufficient for radiation of lung cancer, given that there was no obvious survival improvement in patients treated with the higher total dose regimen.", "prediction_text": "The retrospective analysis did not find a statistically significant difference in overall survival between patients receiving 25 Gy in 5 fractions or 50 Gy in 20 fractions of palliative radiotherapy for lung cancer. However, a subgroup analysis suggested that patients with a good-fair overall condition may have a slightly longer survival with the higher dose, but this difference was not statistically significant. The study did not find any benefit of high-dose radiotherapy in patients with a poor overall condition."}
{"answers": "Although elevated leukocyte count and CRP value cannot effectively establish the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the elderly, unelevated values exclude it. Accordingly, appendectomy is not recommended to be performed in an elderly patient with unelevated leukocyte count and CRP value, although clinical symptoms and signs indicate acute appendicitis.", "prediction_text": "Leukocyte count and CRP measurements can be used as adjuncts in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the elderly, but not all patients with acute appendicitis will have elevated values for both markers. The study found that elderly patients with acute appendicitis had elevated leukocyte counts or CRP values, or both, and no patients had normal values for both markers."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrates that in patients at risk for cardiac morbidity undergoing vascular surgery, desflurane is effective to control intraoperative hypertension without fear of major cardiac depressant effect.", "prediction_text": "Desflurane does not significantly alter left ventricular function when used to control surgically induced hypertension during aortic surgery. However, it does increase afterload as indicated by an increase in systemic vascular resistance index, end-systolic wall-stress, and left-ventricular stroke work index."}
{"answers": "Development of tolerance to gluten seems possible in some patients with CD. Further follow-up will show whether this tolerance is permanent or only a long-term return to latency. This feature may be associated with genetic characteristics, especially with HLA genotypes that differ from DQ2 or DQ8. More insight into the mechanisms of the development of gluten tolerance may help to distinguish those CD patients that might not require life-long GFD.", "prediction_text": "Two out of 77 adult patients with celiac disease for more than 10 years were found to have developed tolerance to gluten based on immunological and histological assessments. However, the number of patients with true CD who were able to tolerate gluten is low."}
{"answers": "No home-prepared replacement milks in South Africa meet all estimated micronutrient and essential fatty acid requirements of infants aged<6 months. Commercial infant formula is the only replacement milk that meets all nutritional needs. Revisions of WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF HIV and infant feeding course replacement milk options are needed. If replacement milks are to provide total nutrition, preparations should include vegetable oils, such as soybean oil, as a source of linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids, and additional vitamins and minerals.", "prediction_text": "The WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF-recommended replacement milks for infants of HIV-infected mothers do not provide adequate micronutrients and essential fatty acids in the South African context, as shown in this study. Home-prepared replacement milks using powdered full cream milk or fresh full cream milk with certain micronutrient supplements were found to be less costly and quicker to prepare but still did not meet the recommended nutritional requirements fully. Commercial formula was more expensive but provided a higher percentage of the recommended nutrients."}
{"answers": "We have shown that eosinophilic inflammation of the airway wall may increase PD and that the association of eosinophil counts with ICSs may result in lessening the PD.", "prediction_text": "Inhaled corticosteroids can influence the perception of dyspnea during bronchoconstriction in asthma patients by reversing the effect of airway inflammation, as evidenced by a negative correlation between eosinophil counts and perception of dyspnea in ICS-treated patients."}
{"answers": "High socioeconomic status was associated with a higher acceptance rate of preventive home visits, but the association was attenuated by invitational procedures. The results indicate that the social inequality in acceptance of publicly offered preventive services might decrease if municipalities adopt more proactive invitational procedures.", "prediction_text": "Older people with higher financial assets are more likely to accept preventive home visits, but the association is attenuated when considering the role of invitational procedures. However, the data suggests that older people with lower financial assets who receive a letter with a proposed date are more likely to accept the visits than those with higher assets using other procedures. The findings indicate some social imbalance in the acceptance rates of the preventive home visit programme."}
{"answers": "In the present study, FT and androstenedione were statistically significantly correlated with sexual desire in the total cohort of women. ADT-G did not correlate more strongly than circulating androgens with sexual desire and is therefore not superior to measuring circulating androgens by mass spectrometry.", "prediction_text": "In women, the correlation between circulating androgens, particularly free testosterone and androstenedione, and sexual desire is significant, especially in younger women and those not using hormonal contraception. The correlation with the primary androgen metabolite androsterone glucuronide was not significant."}
{"answers": "The results of these analyses suggest that marginally higher rates of depression to age 35 amongst the comorbid MD/AUD group were explained by increased exposure to adverse childhood circumstances amongst members of the comorbid group. Adolescent MD/AUD comorbidity is likely to be a risk marker, rather than a causal factor in subsequent MD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, comorbid major depression and alcohol use disorder in adolescence is associated with poorer subsequent depression outcomes, but the difference in outcomes between comorbid and major depression-only groups was no longer statistically significant after adjusting for confounding factors such as gender, childhood behavior problems, and exposure to physical and sexual abuse."}
{"answers": "There are no statistically apparent motion differences between SUP-CTV and INF-CTV. Current uniform planning target volume (PTV) margins are adequate to cover both portions of the CTV.", "prediction_text": "No statistically significant differences in target motion were found between the superior and inferior portions of the prostate bed clinical target volume using RTOG consensus definitions and daily CT on rails."}
{"answers": "Combined end points for adverse events are acceptable in the octogenarian. Carotid endarterectomy remains the gold standard for treatment of extracranial carotid disease in all age groups. Age alone should not place patients in the high-risk category for carotid endarterectomy.", "prediction_text": "The data from this study suggests that octogenarians can undergo carotid endarterectomy with a low risk of perioperative neurologic complications and mortality. However, associated risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, and history of smoking should be carefully considered."}
{"answers": "Lysosomotropic amines in combination with cyclosporine appear to be synergistic in the suppression of T-cell proliferation to MiHC and MHC. Use of chloroquine in combination with cyclosporine may result in improved control of GVHD.", "prediction_text": "In vitro studies in mice suggest that the combination of lysosomotropic amines, such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, and cyclosporine can result in synergistic immunosuppression on T-cell responses to both minor and major histocompatibility antigens. This synergy may be due to the unique mechanism of action of lysosomotropic amines, which suppress antigen presentation differently from current immune suppressant drugs like cyclosporine."}
{"answers": "The results of this study suggest that the cardiovascular response to exercise training may be different in men and women. Women may benefit more from interventions aimed to increase physical activity as a tool for prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.", "prediction_text": "Exercise training is associated with a lower heart rate and higher heart rate variability in both men and women. Trained women have a shorter QT interval compared to sedentary women, while there is no difference in QT interval between trained and sedentary men. Exercise training also reduces the QT/RR slope in both genders, with a more pronounced effect in women. This results in a narrowed gender difference in ventricular repolarization duration at low heart rate in trained individuals."}
{"answers": "Although BD is correlated with GCS at presentation and RTS, it is not a reliable prognostic marker for outcome and mortality in patients with isolated TBI.", "prediction_text": "The base deficit was not found to be a significant predictor of mortality in patients with severe traumatic brain injury based on the results of this study. However, there was a negative correlation between base deficit and Glasgow Coma Scale and Revised Trauma Score."}
{"answers": "\"Aquagenic maladies\" could be a pediatric form of the aquagenic urticaria.", "prediction_text": "The syncope observed in infants during bathing may be related to aquagenic urticaria, which is characterized by hives or skin reactions upon contact with water. This condition is associated with dermographism and increased histamine levels. The prognosis is generally favorable, but some infants may continue to experience reactions to sun or water."}
{"answers": "Laparoscopic procedures caused detectable damage to Kupffer and endothelial cells as reflected by elevation of post-operative HA serum levels. The damage to the liver hepatocytes and perisinusoidal cells has no clinical significance and the laparoscopic procedure itself is the probable cause of the Kupffer and endothelial cells damage, while other mechanisms caused damage to the hepatocytes.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find significant changes in peri-sinusoidal cell function, as indicated by beta-NAH levels, after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, post-operative elevations in AST and ALT levels were observed in the study group."}
{"answers": "Sleep disorders are common in the general adult population of Japan. Correction for reporting heterogeneity using anchoring vignettes is not a necessary tool for proper management of sleep and energy related problems among Japanese adults. Older age, gender differences in communicating sleep-related problems, the presence of multiple morbidities, and regular exercise should be the focus of policies and clinical practice to improve sleep and energy management in Japan.", "prediction_text": "Yes, adjusting for reporting heterogeneity is necessary in the evaluation of sleep disorders as it can significantly impact the associations between various factors and the severity of sleep-related problems."}
{"answers": "Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is often challenging in men on account of more adhesions and inflammation. This leads to higher conversion rates and more postoperative complications. Optimized planning and a more experienced operating surgeon may help overcome these problems.", "prediction_text": "Yes, sex is an independent risk factor for conversion to open cholecystectomy and biliary injuries during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Men have a higher risk of these complications compared to women. Additionally, men have a longer operative time and a higher rate of bile duct injuries, gallbladder perforations, and gallstone spillage. However, there are no significant differences in mean hospital stay, wound infection, and port-site herniation between men and women."}
{"answers": "To uphold the notion for radiation exposure to be as low as reasonably achievable, ureteroscopic stone retrieval can safely be done without the use of fluoroscopy in a significant number of patients.", "prediction_text": "Ureteroscopy can be an effective method for the retrieval of lower ureteric stones without the use of fluoroscopy in the majority of cases. Fluoroscopy may be required in certain situations, such as complex anatomy or difficult stone removal, but it is not essential for routine cases."}
{"answers": "Surrogates of injury severity, including days in the ICU and non-ICU hospital LOS>10 days, were associated with the development of HO in our cohort of acetabular fracture patients. Prophylaxis with XRT was significantly protective against the development of HO, and the ability to provide prophylaxis is very likely related to the severity of injury.", "prediction_text": "Injury severity surrogates, such as injury severity score, were not significantly associated with the occurrence and severity of heterotopic ossification following open reduction internal fixation of acetabular fractures treated with a posterior approach. However, length of stay in the intensive care unit and non-ICU length of stay over 10 days, as well as HO prophylaxis with external radiation beam therapy, were significant predictors in a multivariate model."}
{"answers": "In this series of 35 patients, the use of epidural analgesia for HIPEC does not seem to be associated with a worse risk of haemodynamic instability, spinal haematoma, meningitis or epidural abscess. HIPEC with platinum salt is not incompatible with the safety of epidural analgesia, with an optimized fluid management peroperatively and the following of perimedullary anesthesia practice guidelines.", "prediction_text": "The use of epidural analgesia during and after cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) does not appear to significantly increase the risks of spinal hematoma, meningitis, or epidural abscess. However, caution should be exercised in patients with thrombopenia or coagulation disorders before catheter removal."}
{"answers": "The Diabeo system improved glycaemic control in both high and low users who avidly used the IDA function, while the greatest improvement was seen in the low users who had the motivational support of teleconsultations.", "prediction_text": "The use of an insulin dose advisor (IDA) with telemonitoring and teleconsultation functions can improve glycaemic control in high users of the IDA, but the technology alone may not be sufficient for all patients with type 1 diabetes. The additional support provided by teleconsultations may contribute to greater improvement in glycaemic control for some low users."}
{"answers": "Despite a lower risk of breast cancer, the Sami attended the NBCSP more frequently than the control group. The recall and cancer detection rate was lower among the Sami compared with the non-Sami group.", "prediction_text": "The attendance rate and recall rate in the Norwegian Breast Cancer Screening Program were higher in the non-Sami population compared to the Sami-speaking municipalities, but the rate of invasive cancer detected and the percentage of all breast cancers detected in the screening program were not significantly different between the two groups."}
{"answers": "GP ablation did not prove to be beneficial for postoperative stable NSR. A complete left atrial lesion set and biatrial ablation are advisable for improving rhythm outcomes. Randomized controlled trials are necessary to confirm our findings.", "prediction_text": "The absence of ganglionated plexi ablation during a Cox-Maze IV procedure did not significantly affect the maintenance of sinus rhythm at long-term follow-up in patients with persistent or long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation. Other factors such as duration of AF, left atrial diameter, left atrial area, absence of connecting lesions, and absence of right atrial ablation were independently associated with a higher incidence of AF recurrence."}
{"answers": "It is concluded that serum pancreatic lipase is a more accurate biomarker of acute pancreatitis than serum amylase.", "prediction_text": "Based on the study findings, serum pancreatic lipase has a higher diagnostic accuracy for acute pancreatitis compared to serum amylase. However, it is important to note that both markers have their roles in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis and neither should completely replace the other. The decision to use one marker over the other should be based on the clinical context and availability."}
{"answers": "Transgastric endoscopic splenectomy in a porcine model appears technically feasible. Additional long-term survival experiments are planned.", "prediction_text": "Yes, based on the results of this study in a porcine model, transgastric endoscopic splenectomy is technically feasible using a flexible endoscope."}
{"answers": "Brachial systolic blood pressure difference is related to the severity of SSS and can be used as a screening tool for SSS. However, it performed better in severe steal than milder steal phenomena.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a larger side-to-side difference in systolic blood pressure is associated with more severe subclavian steal syndrome. The study found that patients with complete reversal or alternating flow waveforms had significantly larger blood pressure differences compared to those with systolic deceleration waveforms."}
{"answers": "a-tDCS could be useful in identifying residual connectivity markers in clinically-defined UWS, who may lack of purposeful behavior as a result of a motor-output failure.", "prediction_text": "Transcranial direct current stimulation over the orbitofrontal cortex can potentially unmask residual networks and improve cortical connectivity and excitability in some unresponsive wakefulness syndrome patients, suggesting a possible difference from minimally conscious state patients."}
{"answers": "Most people in France are influenced by situational factors when deciding if a physician should breach confidentiality to protect the spouse of a patient infected with STD.", "prediction_text": "Lay people and psychologists in France generally find it more acceptable than physicians to breach confidentiality to protect a patient's wife from a sexually transmitted disease. The patient's intentions to protect his wife and inform her of the disease have the greatest impact on acceptability."}
{"answers": "Most students do not encounter all 10 conditions during patient encounters throughout a 4-week EM rotation, although most have exposure to at least eight. Certain conditions are far less likely than others to be encountered, and may need to be taught in a nonclinical setting.", "prediction_text": "While the majority of medical students in a 4th-year EM clerkship encountered a significant number of the recommended core conditions, not all students met the standard of encountering all 10 conditions during their rotation. The average number of core conditions seen per student was 8.4, with wide variability."}
{"answers": "The findings indicate that the clinical significance of symptomatic BDS is similar to that of CBD stones. Bile duct sludge seems to be an early stage of choledocholithiasis.", "prediction_text": "Bile duct sludge and bile duct stones have some differences in terms of frequency, associated risk factors, and clinical outcome after endoscopic therapy. While bile duct sludge occurs in 14% of patients with suspected choledocholithiasis and is more common in females, the recurrence rate of CBD stones after endoscopic clearance is higher (17% vs. 16%) but not statistically significant. Common bile duct dilation is less common in the sludge group, but other known risk factors for recurrent CBD stones are not statistically different between the two groups."}
{"answers": "Routine placement of nasogastric tube in patients operated of LSG seems not useful in reducing leaks' incidence.", "prediction_text": "The results of this study suggest that the placement of a nasogastric tube after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy may reduce the risk of staple line leaks. However, it is associated with a longer postoperative hospital stay. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "The results obtained in this study demonstrate that LUS is an accurate and highly sensitive procedure in staging colorectal cancer, providing a useful and reliable diagnostic tool complementary to laparoscopy.", "prediction_text": "Laparoscopic ultrasonography (LUS) is a valuable tool for staging colorectal cancer during laparoscopic surgery, particularly in the evaluation of hepatic metastases and nodal involvement. However, it has a lower specificity compared to other staging methods. The use of LUS can lead to changes in therapeutic management in a significant number of cases."}
{"answers": "Most community providers believe IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion; this belief is associated with increased resource use. Experts comply more closely with guidelines to diagnose IBS with minimal testing. This disconnect suggests that better implementation of guidelines is warranted to minimize variation and improve cost-effectiveness of care.", "prediction_text": "According to the guidelines, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is not a diagnosis of exclusion. However, some clinicians may still hold the belief that IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion. The study found that IBS experts were less likely to endorse IBS as a diagnosis of exclusion and were more likely to make a positive diagnosis, perform fewer tests, and spend less money on testing compared to nonexperts. The belief that IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion was associated with ordering more tests and spending more money."}
{"answers": "Correlation between level of radiographic transition zone on contrast enema and length of aganglionosis remains low. Systematic preoperative biopsy by coelioscopy or ombilical incision is mandatory.", "prediction_text": "The correlation between the radiographic transition zone on contrast enema and the level of aganglionosis on the specimen in Hirschsprung's disease is inaccurate, with a global agreement of 58.1% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.39 (CI [0.24; 0.57])."}
{"answers": "The presence of a high signal intensity change on T2-weighted MRI and the pyramidal tract sign can be used as prognostic factors for patients with CSA.", "prediction_text": "The presence of T2 high signal intensity areas on MRI and the conversion to surgery are associated with a poorer neurological prognosis in patients with cervical spondylotic amyotrophy. The presence of a pyramidal tract sign is also significantly associated with a poor recovery after surgery."}
{"answers": "We conclude that not all low-tone sudden deafness (SD) patients suffered from endolymphatic hydrops even if they had vertigo attack at the onset and that electrocochleography (ECochG) was a useful prognostic tool.", "prediction_text": "Not all cases of low-tone sudden deafness progress to Meniere's disease. The presence of recurrent episodes and vertigo may increase the risk of progression. However, the study did not find a significant difference in the rate of progression between low-tone and high-tone Sudden Sensory Hearing Loss groups."}
{"answers": "It is concluded that ACE-DD genotype may be a risk factor for the causation and development of chronic kidney failure among hypertensive patients.", "prediction_text": "The D allele of the ACE-1 gene is associated with an increased risk for chronic kidney disease among hypertensive patients. However, the study also identified that other factors such as age, BMI, hemoglobin, blood urea, serum creatinine, total cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol may also play a role."}
{"answers": "Older people with a history of amblyopia who develop visual loss in the previously normal eye can experience recovery of visual function in the amblyopic eye over a period of time. This recovery in visual function occurs in the wake of visual loss in the fellow eye and the improvement appears to be sustained.", "prediction_text": "Amblyopia, a condition characterized by reduced visual acuity in one eye despite a normal or unremarkable examination of the eye, can improve with time in some cases. The improvement in visual acuity is usually observed between 1 and 12 months and remains stable over the period of follow up. However, the extent of improvement may vary and is not permanent in all cases."}
{"answers": "These results suggest that quantitative real-time PCR assays for BCRABL detection can be comparable between laboratories despite significant differences in methodologies if the same positive control cell line and quality control gene are used. It is imperative that some level of assay standardization be adopted between laboratories, not only for patients who are monitored at different facilities, but also for larger investigative studies in which hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular responses are to be compared.", "prediction_text": "The use of standardized methodology is essential for achieving correlated results in BCRABL transcript detection by quantitative real-time PCR across different laboratories. The study demonstrated a strong correlation between results from two laboratories using different methods, but the occurrence of one discordant result highlights the importance of standardization."}
{"answers": "Although the exact mechanism of SSDH in this case is unclear, we speculate that this SSDH was a hematoma that migrated from the intracranial subdural space. Low CSF pressure because of continuous drainage and intrathecal thrombolytic therapy may have played an important role in the migration of the hematoma through the spinal canal. It is important to recognize the SSDH as a possible complication of the SAH accompanied with intracranial subdural hematoma.", "prediction_text": "Yes, this case report describes a rare occurrence of spinal subdural hematoma following a ruptured intracranial internal carotid aneurysm."}
{"answers": "LAA occlusion device resulted in a slightly movement in QRS axis, reduced HR and increased the mean-mean QT interval duration. In addition, LA diameter and ARD seemed to be larger after device implantation.", "prediction_text": "After LAA occlusion therapy, slight changes in QRS electric axis and heart rate, as well as prolonged mean-mean QT interval, were observed in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, no significant differences were found in echocardiographic parameters immediately after device implantation. During follow-up visits, a larger left atrial diameter and aortic root diameter were detected."}
{"answers": "The study results suggested that spinal cord untethering may be unnecessary in patients with MM who are undergoing scoliosis corrective surgery and do not present with clinical symptoms of a tethered cord, even though tethering is radiographically demonstrated.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that in carefully selected patients with myelomeningocele who have no clinically symptomatic tethered cord, no neurological complications were observed when scoliosis correction was performed without prior untethering. However, individualized decision-making and close postoperative monitoring are necessary due to the potential risks involved."}
{"answers": "Under the conditions of this study, pulpotomy offered a viable alternative to root canal treatment for teeth with vital pulps in the short term. However, there is insufficient clinical evidence to consider this technique for the treatment of every permanent tooth. Nevertheless, it should be considered as a potential alternative approach to be further developed for future applications.", "prediction_text": "The survival rate of teeth treated with pulp chamber pulpotomy and filling with ProRoot MTA(\u00ae) at 24 months was estimated to be 82%, with some teeth requiring additional treatment. While pulp potomy can be considered as a permanent treatment, the need for additional procedures indicates that long-term monitoring and possible future interventions may be necessary."}
{"answers": "The site of access in our study does not appear to influence complications specifically neural injury or recurrence rates.", "prediction_text": "The site of endovenous access during endovenous laser ablation for small saphenous varicose veins does not significantly influence early outcomes in terms of complications and recurrence."}
{"answers": "Retinal haemorrhages following a convulsive episode are rare. Such a finding should trigger an extensive search for other reasons, including child abuse.", "prediction_text": "A single unilateral retinal hemorrhage following a convulsive episode in a child should prompt further investigation to rule out underlying systemic disorders or child abuse."}
{"answers": "Clear and distinct differences between the two studied groups were found indicating the root of this increased confidence may have developed due to exposure to the Pathway program.", "prediction_text": "The Global Longitudinal Pathway medical education curriculum appears to have a positive influence on medical students' skills and attitudes toward working with culturally diverse populations, as evidenced by statistically significant differences in confidence ratings and qualitative findings."}
{"answers": "In normal daily practice, only a small number of clinically important adenomas are missed. The problem of missed adenomas probably is being exaggerated.", "prediction_text": "Based on the data from this study, it appears that only a small percentage (1.3%) of colorectal cancers may be due to missed adenomas during previous endoscopies."}
{"answers": "Emotional prosody, therefore, seems to be partially processed outside the focus of spatial attention. Whereas at early sensory processing stages spatial attention modulates the degree of emotional voice processing as a function of emotional valence, emotional prosody is processed outside of the focus of spatial attention at later processing stages.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the processing of affective prosody is influenced by spatial attention, with interactions occurring at early processing stages and additive effects at later stages."}
{"answers": "Pancreas retransplantation is a safe procedure with acceptable graft survival that should be proposed to diabetic patients who have lost their primary graft.", "prediction_text": "Pancreas retransplantation can provide a second chance for type 1 diabetic patients with end-stage renal disease who have lost their primary graft, as shown by improved second graft survival and excellent patient survival, with no negative impact on kidney graft function."}
{"answers": "Weekend hospitalization leads to delayed provision of intensive procedures and elevated 1-year mortality for elderly AMI patients. The existence of measurable differences in treatments raises questions regarding the efficacy of a single input regulation (e.g., mandated nurse staffing ratios) in enhancing the quality of weekend care. My results suggest that targeted financial incentives might be a more cost-effective policy response than broad regulation aimed at improving quality.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that Medicare patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction on weekends are less likely to receive immediate intensive cardiac procedures and experience higher rates of adverse health outcomes, including increased mortality and readmission, compared to weekday patients. This indicates that weekend care may not be of the same quality as weekday care in this specific patient population."}
{"answers": "The presence of more than one virus in hospitalized children with ARI is very frequent but it does not seem to have a major clinical impact in terms of severity. However bacterial superinfection increases the severity of the disease course. On the contrary, pneumococcal vaccination plays a protective role.", "prediction_text": "Bacterial superinfection, but not viral co-infection, is associated with increased severity, longer hospital stays, and higher risk of PICU admission, respiratory support requirement, and oxygen necessity in children with acute respiratory infections. Pneumococcal vaccination is protective against these outcomes."}
{"answers": "In our study, it was observed that although longer ETA was associated with longer hospitalization, ETA was not correlated with postoperative complications. Our results inclined toward the position that appendectomy can be performed as a semielective surgery.", "prediction_text": "The time from emergency room registration to appendectomy (ETA) does not significantly increase the incidence of perforation or postoperative complications in patients with acute appendicitis. However, patients with longer ETA had longer hospital stays. Other factors, such as age, perforated appendicitis, and open appendectomy, were identified as predictors for postoperative complications."}
{"answers": "Fetal gender does not affect the risk of having an ED visit for asthma during pregnancy, and it is not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes among women who had an asthma-related ED during pregnancy.", "prediction_text": "Fetal gender is not associated with an increased risk of emergency department visits for asthma during pregnancy."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that working exposure increases the risk or leads to the clinical manifestation of rotator cuff tears. Although a detailed analysis of individual physical exposure is not available yet, the statistical results indicate that rotator cuff tears must be taken into consideration as a result of ergonomic exposure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a higher prevalence of rotator cuff tears in males working in agriculture and forestry, as well as in the building industry compared to the general population. However, more research is needed to establish a definitive causal relationship."}
{"answers": "High-quality training, strict compliance with evidence-based guidelines, and thorough documentation is associated with significant reductions in CLABSIs. Mindful organizing may lead to a better understanding of what goes into a unit's ability to handle peak demands and sustain extraordinary performance in the long-term.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a zero central line-associated bloodstream infection rate is sustainable with the implementation and maintenance of evidence-based measures, ongoing training, surveillance, and vigilance in the NICU."}
{"answers": "Ketamine sedation was successful and well tolerated in all cases. The use of atropine as an adjunct for intramuscular ketamine sedation in children significantly reduces hypersalivation and may lower the incidence of post-procedural vomiting. Atropine is associated with a higher incidence of a transient rash. No serious adverse events were noted.", "prediction_text": "Atropine is not essential for ketamine sedation in children undergoing minor painful procedures, as it does not significantly reduce hypersalivation or improve procedural success rate. However, it may decrease the incidence of vomiting during recovery. The use of atropine is associated with an increased risk of transient rash."}
{"answers": "Findings depict wandering and PNA as overlapping, but nonequivalent phenomena. Evidence supporting construct validity of wandering was more robust than that for PNA. Results have implications for accuracy in scientific and clinical detection and labeling of wandering and agitation.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that wandering and physically non-aggressive agitation (PNA) are related but distinct concepts in the context of dementia care. While there is a significant correlation between the two, they represent different aspects of behavioral disturbance."}
{"answers": "An advance care planning model is feasible for community palliative care services. Quality audit processes are an essential component of the Model with documentation of advance care planning discussion established as an important outcome measure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the implementation of an advance care planning model in community palliative care is feasible, as demonstrated by the findings from this multi-site action research study. The focus on advance care planning conversations and family involvement, rather than just completion rates of documents, was found to be important in community settings. Adaptation and application of the model to each service's unique concept of community, as well as changes to quality audit processes, were essential for successful integration into routine practice."}
{"answers": "The study allows us to determine that FB can move through the body but not towards the heart. The study also serves as a warning sign: in cases of prolonged histories of FB ingestion, imaging studies are mandatory before endoscopic examination.", "prediction_text": "Rare cases of foreign bodies migrating from the mucosa towards the heart have been reported. Mechanisms of migration include local inflammation, muscle contractions, and erosion of surrounding tissues. Diagnosis can be challenging and may require a combination of clinical, radiologic, endoscopic, and ultrasound evaluations."}
{"answers": "Although most players in the study believe that rugby headgear may prevent concussion, only a minority reported wearing it. Coaches tended to be less convinced than the players that rugby headgear can prevent concussion.", "prediction_text": "While players tend to believe that headgear can prevent concussion, coaches are less convinced. However, only a minority of players actually wear headgear and its use is not universally considered mandatory. Therefore, the evidence from this study does not definitively answer the question of whether rugby headgear can prevent concussion."}
{"answers": "Early oral intake is possible after laparotomy and colorectal resection. Thus, the laparoscopic surgeon's claim of early tolerated oral intake may not be unique to laparoscopy.", "prediction_text": "Early postoperative oral intake is not limited to laparoscopic surgery, as this study demonstrates that it is also possible after laparotomy and colorectal resection. However, the rate of nasogastric tube reinsertion and length of hospitalization may vary between patients."}
{"answers": "Both medial and lateral PTS were significantly steeper in failures of ACLR than the control group. Medial or lateral PTS \u22655\u00b0 was a new risk factor of ACLR failure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that patients with steep posterior tibial slopes, specifically those with medial and lateral slopes \u22655 degrees, had a higher risk of failure of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction."}
{"answers": "These results suggest the need to provide interventions that are specifically designed to increase awareness of potential stroke signs and symptoms and appropriate subsequent clinical actions.", "prediction_text": "Only about two-thirds of elderly patients correctly reported that they would call 911 when presented with signs and symptoms of acute stroke, and the percentage was even lower for Amaurosis Fugax. Higher levels of education were associated with a higher likelihood of correctly endorsing the intention to call 911."}
{"answers": "We conclude that routine CXR after bronchoscopy with TBB is necessary only in patients with symptoms suggestive of pneumothorax. In asymptomatic patients, pneumothorax is rare and usually small, so routine CXR is not necessary in this category of patients.", "prediction_text": "The need for routine chest radiography after transbronchial biopsy is debatable. While it can help detect pneumothorax, particularly in symptomatic patients, the majority of cases may be asymptomatic and self-resolving. The decision to perform routine CXR should be individualized based on patient factors and clinical suspicion."}
{"answers": "Early surfactant administration is associated with shorter duration of ventilation but does not appear to be significantly protective against CLD/mortality among premature infants. This may support the growing evidence for consideration of CPAP as an alternative to routine intubation and early surfactant administration. Further investigation from large randomized clinical trials is warranted to confirm these results.", "prediction_text": "In this study, early surfactant administration within one hour of birth was associated with a higher risk of chronic lung disease and mortality in premature infants compared to late surfactant administration. However, early surfactant treatment was linked to shorter durations of mechanical ventilation and continuous positive airway pressure, as well as longer hospital stays, but had minimal impact on chronic lung disease or mortality."}
{"answers": "The study supports the hypothesis that nurses' aides who were exposed to ETS at home during childhood have an increased risk of long-term sickness absence.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that individuals who were exposed to environmental tobacco smoke during childhood had an increased risk of long-term sick leave, specifically for neck pain, high back pain, low back pain, and any illness. They also had an increased risk of sick leave exceeding 8 weeks."}
{"answers": "We concluded that depiction of the superior wall of the mandibular canal cannot be improved by changing the thickness of images.", "prediction_text": "The use of 0.9 mm-thick double-oblique CT images can provide the best mandibular depiction, but there is no significant difference between 0.3 mm and 0.9 mm-thick images."}
{"answers": "Exclusive CRT approach is not safe to treat patients with low infiltrative rectal carcinoma.", "prediction_text": "For mid and low rectal tumors, chemoradiation (CRT) can be considered as an alternative to surgery for those with complete response (CR) to reduce local recurrence. However, long-term follow-up is necessary due to the risk of local recurrence, especially in those without surgical intervention. The presence of lymph node metastases and perineural invasion are negative prognostic factors for overall survival."}
{"answers": "Random survival forests did not yield higher performance compared to Cox proportional hazards. We found improvement in prediction performance when coupling the genetic SNP score with clinical/demographic markers, which warrants further investigation.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that adding validated susceptibility SNP scores to risk models for BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers can improve predictive ability, with an average Harrell's concordance index of 0.221 for BRCA1 and 0.215 for BRCA2 carriers."}
{"answers": "Bedtime NPH insulin added to maximal therapy with sulfonylurea and metformin is an effective, simple, well-tolerated approach for patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes.", "prediction_text": "In type 2 diabetes patients not controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents alone, adding insulin to ongoing oral therapy resulted in similar HbA1c reduction, fewer treatment failures, less weight gain, and fewer hypoglycemic events compared to insulin monotherapy. However, patients in the insulin monotherapy group reported equal satisfaction with treatment and had similar general well-being improvements. Fear of self-injecting and self-testing did not differ between the groups."}
{"answers": "PET data show that amoxapine's profile is very similar to that of the established atypical antipsychotics. These data, together with amoxapine's in vitro pharmacologic profile, effectiveness in animal models, and efficacy in psychotic depression raise the possibility of amoxapine as an \"atypical\" antipsychotic agent in the treatment of schizophrenia.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, amoxapine can be considered an atypical antipsychotic with high serotonin 5-HT2 occupancy, greater 5-HT2 than dopamine D2 occupancy, and a lower risk of extrapyramidal side effects at therapeutic doses."}
{"answers": "In gravid ewes, intravenous infusion of<or = 1.67 micrograms/min epinephrine altered neither maternal hemodynamics nor uterine blood flow. To the extent that sheep data can be extrapolated to humans, these results suggest that continuous intravenous infusion of epinephrine in local anesthetic solutions is safe if the epidural catheter should enter a blood vessel during the infusion.", "prediction_text": "No, continuous intravenous infusion of low-concentration epinephrine does not impair uterine blood flow in pregnant ewes. However, a bolus injection of epinephrine can decrease uterine blood flow."}
{"answers": "These data indicate that major blunt trauma enhances the migratory capacity of circulating neutrophils. This is manifest within 2 hrs of admission and may be attributable to alteration in interleukin-8 receptor expression, affinity, or downstream signaling. In patients who later develop ARDS, initially elevated circulating neutrophil counts decrease rapidly, over the same time course. Early enhanced neutrophil migratory activity coupled with elevated pulmonary concentrations of interleukin-8 may be central to the establishment of the neutrophil infiltration that is characteristic of ARDS.", "prediction_text": "Yes, enhanced neutrophil migratory activity in response to interleukin-8 in the early post-trauma phase may be a crucial factor in the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in major trauma patients."}
{"answers": "Memory provocation increased the sensitivity of rCBF-SPECT for the detection of AD-related blood flow changes in the brain at the group level. Further studies are needed to evaluate MP-SPECT as a diagnostic tool at the individual level. If a higher sensitivity for AD at the individual level is verified in future studies, a single MP-SPECT study might be sufficient in the clinical setting.", "prediction_text": "Memory-provoked rCBF-SPECT (MP-SPECT) can improve the diagnostic sensitivity for Alzheimer's disease (AD) by revealing significant reductions in left parietal cortex rCBF during memory tasks."}
{"answers": "1. DBE is a safe and and accurate method to diagnose small bowel disorders; 2. this method permits chromoscopy, biopsies and treatment of the lesions.", "prediction_text": "Double-balloon enteroscopy is an effective method for diagnosing small-bowel disorders, achieving a diagnostic yield of 75% and therapeutic yield of 63.6% in this study."}
{"answers": "Reorganization of care to offer a primary angioplasty service was acceptable to patients and their carers. Satisfaction levels were high regardless of the type of care received, with the exception of discharge and aftercare.", "prediction_text": "Primary angioplasty is generally accepted as an effective alternative to thrombolysis for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, with higher patient satisfaction for some aspects of care such as speed of treatment. However, it may come with added inconvenience for carers due to the need for hospital visits. Patient satisfaction with discharge and aftercare is lower for both treatment methods."}
{"answers": "The leukocyte count at presentation can be used as an adjunct in the evaluation of the severity of injury in blunt trauma patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the leukocyte count at presentation is correlated positively with the injury severity score (ISS) in blunt trauma patients. However, it is negatively correlated with the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and the revised trauma score (RTS). This suggests that a higher leukocyte count may indicate a more severe injury."}
{"answers": "Right ventricular recovery following PVR for chronic significant pulmonary regurgitation after repair of TOF may be compromised in the adult population. In order to maintain adequate RV contractility, pulmonary valve implant in these patients should be considered before RV function deteriorates.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that pulmonary valve replacement in adults late after repair of tetralogy of Fallot may not significantly improve right ventricular volume and function, and that earlier intervention may be beneficial for maintaining adequate right ventricular ejection fraction."}
{"answers": "Combined approach tympanoplasty (CAT) allows for successful treatment of cholesteatoma with rates of recurrent and residual disease comparable to open mastoid surgery. Early timing of second-look procedures allows easier removal of any recurrent or residual disease, which reduces the conversion rate to open mastoidectomy.", "prediction_text": "The data from this study suggests that the rate of conversion to modified radical mastoidectomy during second-look tympanoplasty is low (3%). However, the study does not provide information on whether early second-look tympanoplasty specifically reduces this rate. Further research is needed to answer this question."}
{"answers": "In 1995, the first year that the MQSA was in effect, there was a significant improvement in the quality of mammography in North Carolina. This improvement probably resulted from facilities' compliance with federal regulations.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the implementation of the Mammography Quality Standards Act in North Carolina led to improvements in mammography quality, as evidenced by an increase in the percentage of facilities meeting quality standards and improvements in passing rates for phantom scores, darkroom fog, and temperature difference."}
{"answers": "HIE was associated with reduced repeat imaging in EDs. This study is among the first to find empirical support for this anticipated benefit of HIE.", "prediction_text": "Yes, according to this study, health information exchange is associated with a reduction in repeat imaging in emergency departments for computed tomography, ultrasound, and chest x-ray tests, reflecting reductions of 44%-67% relative to sample means."}
{"answers": "Gestational age misclassification is an unlikely explanation for the reported divergence in average birth-weights for Aborigines and whites. The results might help with the interpretation of other between-population comparisons.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that gestational age misclassification may not fully explain the difference in birthweights between Australian Aborigines and whites, as the effect of misclassification on the 90th centiles was significant. However, the study also indicates that the reported pattern of slower increase in summary measures of location for birthweights for Australian Aborigines compared to whites is robust at full term and for the 10th centiles. Further research is needed to fully understand the underlying causes of the observed difference in birthweights."}
{"answers": "W-d HCCs were clinically demonstrated not to be early cancer, because there was no significant difference in disease free survival between the patients with w-d and l-d HCCs.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that well differentiated small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may have microscopic foci of cancer present at the time of surgery, increasing the risk of recurrence, despite the absence of fibrous capsule formation, fibrous invasion, or portal vein invasion. Therefore, well differentiated small HCC may not be considered truly clinically early cancer."}
{"answers": "The incidence of post-tonsillectomy late haemorrhage in our study population was 1.78%. A statistically significant difference was found between night-time and day-time haemorrhages. Even though no significant distribution of haemorrhages per hour was observed, we underline that we recorded 32 (54.2%) events in 2 periods of the day: from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. and from 6 to 9 a.m.", "prediction_text": "Yes, post-tonsillectomy late haemorrhages are more frequent in the night-time (between 9.00 p.m. and 9.00 a.m.) compared to the day-time (between 9.00 a.m. and 9.00 p.m.) based on the findings of this study."}
{"answers": "Biased estimates of asthma severity may contribute to racially disparate asthma care. Interventions to improve physicians' assessments of asthma severity and patient-physician communication may minimize racial disparities in asthma care.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that black patients were more likely to have their asthma severity underestimated by physicians compared to white patients, and this underestimation was associated with poorer quality asthma care in black patients."}
{"answers": "Many factors contribute to the erroneous reporting of hCG results, including (a) the complexity of hCG molecule and confusion of nomenclature on the various forms of hCG; (b) laboratory personnel's lack of awareness of the distinctions of the forms of hCG and failure to recognize the specificity of assays for their measurement; (c) lack of clarity and uniformity in manufacturers' reagent labeling; and (d) most product inserts' lack of information on the specificity of each method to the various forms of hCG.", "prediction_text": "There is a significant number of errors in the reporting of hCG results by laboratories, with some reporting total beta hCG as intact hCG and others reporting intact hCG as total beta hCG. Correct reporting of hCG results is clinically important."}
{"answers": "This study has shown that mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons concerning a certain issue is not sufficient to lead to a change in practice.", "prediction_text": "The results of this study suggest that mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons did not significantly reduce the use of prophylactic nasogastric decompression in elective colonic resections."}
{"answers": "These data suggest that either apoptosis is not involved in cell loss in MTS, or a very slow rate of cell demise may have precluded detecting TUNEL-positive neurons dying through apoptosis. Increased Bax expression and activation of caspases support the latter possibility.", "prediction_text": "Despite the presence of increased Bax expression and caspase activation, the study did not find evidence of apoptotic cell death in mesial temporal sclerosis as indicated by the absence of DNA fragmentation and typical apoptotic nuclear morphology."}
{"answers": "Golytely was more efficacious than MiraLAX in bowel cleansing, and was independently associated with both bowel prep quality (BBPS \u2265 7) and higher adenoma detection. Golytely should be used as first line for bowel prep for colonoscopy. Studies with larger populations are needed to confirm these results.", "prediction_text": "In this study, Golytely was associated with a higher adenoma detection rate compared to MiraLAX, although the difference was not statistically significant (26.2% vs. 16.1%, P = 0.091). However, on multivariate analysis, Golytely was more likely to be associated with both a better bowel preparation quality and adenoma detection compared to MiraLAX."}
{"answers": "Patient's age (>60 y) and large polyp size (>10 mm) were significant predictive factors for neoplastic GB polyps. GB polyps less than 10 mm in diameter do not require surgical intervention simply because they grow.", "prediction_text": "The growth rate of a gallbladder polyp is not a reliable predictor of a neoplastic polyp. However, older age and a polyp size greater than 10 mm are significant risk factors for neoplastic polyps."}
{"answers": "These data suggest that the R14C KCNQ1 mutation alone is insufficient to cause AF. Rather, we suggest a model in which a \"second hit\", such as an environmental factor like hypertension, which promotes atrial stretch and thereby unmasks an inherited defect in ion channel kinetics (the \"first hit\"), is required for AF to be manifested. Such a model would also account for the age-related increase in AF development.", "prediction_text": "A specific KCNQ1 mutation (R14C) was identified in a family with a high prevalence of hypertension and atrial fibrillation. The mutation did not affect channel kinetics at baseline or after activation, but showed increased current, altered channel kinetics, and shortened action potential duration upon cell swelling/stretch, suggesting a link between genetic and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation."}
{"answers": "The real-time PCR approach revealed promising results in pollen identification and quantification, even when analyzing pollen mixes. Future perspectives could concern the development of multiplex real-time PCR for the simultaneous detection of different taxa in the same reaction tube and the application of high-throughput molecular methods.", "prediction_text": "The use of real-time PCR for biomolecular identification of allergenic pollen offers a rapid, accurate, and automated alternative to traditional morphologic identification methods for aerobiological monitoring."}
{"answers": "The Ambu SIB was able to accurately deliver targeted pressures across all three models from preterm to infant. The Neopuff infant resuscitator was unable to deliver the targeted pressures in the infant model developing clinically significant levels of inadvertent PEEP which may pose risk during infant resuscitation.", "prediction_text": "The Ambu self-inflating bag provided accurate and safe manual inflations for infants up to 10 kg weight, while the Neopuff T-piece resuscitator had difficulty reaching set peak inflation pressures and exhibited elevated positive end expiratory pressures in the infant model."}
{"answers": "This longitudinal study found no significant effect of menopausal transition on quality of life among Taiwanese women. The decline in the role limitations due to emotional problems was related to vasomotor symptoms.", "prediction_text": "Menopausal transition, as assessed by the presence of vasomotor symptoms, can negatively impact certain aspects of quality of life, specifically role limitation due to emotional problems, in middle-aged women. However, the menopausal transition itself did not significantly affect the overall quality of life as measured by the eight domains of the Short Form-36 in the multivariate regression model."}
{"answers": "The incidence of CPM is not increased in IVF/ICSI pregnancies compared with spontaneous conceptions. CPM probably does not account for the adverse perinatal outcomes following IVF/ICSI.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study do not provide sufficient evidence to suggest that confined placental mosaicism is the primary cause of poorer perinatal outcomes in IVF pregnancies. The incidence of CPM was lower in the IVF group, but the difference was not statistically significant, and the incidence of fetal chromosomal anomalies was increased in the IVF group but the difference was also not statistically significant."}
{"answers": "For risk stratification in emergency surgical patients, it is essential to measure the APACHE II score before surgical treatment. Longitudinal APACHE II scoring reveals continuous improvement of the score in surviving patients but has no therapeutic relevance in the individual patient.", "prediction_text": "The APACHE II score, while useful for risk stratification in emergency surgical patients, may be influenced by treatment effects and may not be an independent marker of physiological impairment. The score's predictive accuracy for mortality can vary depending on the time of assessment in the ICU."}
{"answers": "The methodologic weaknesses of the studies do not permit acceptance of increased risk of tubal pregnancy or infertility as a consequence of perforation of the appendix, so a causal relationship cannot be supported by the data currently available. Only a well-designed case-control study with unbiased ascertainment of exposure and adjustment for confounding variables will provide a definitive answer.", "prediction_text": "The evidence suggests that perforation of the appendix may be a risk factor for both tubal infertility and ectopic pregnancy, but the data is limited and the studies have some methodological limitations, such as recall bias and poor adjustment for confounding variables."}
{"answers": "Cancellous bone plays an important role in primary stability of mini-implants in the presence or absence of cortical bone.", "prediction_text": "Trabecular bone properties, such as trabecular number, thickness, bone volume density, and mineral density, are positively correlated with the primary stability of miniscrews. Lower primary stability is observed in miniscrews inserted into bone blocks with lower trabecular bone mineral density and in the absence of cortical bone."}
{"answers": "Despite recent efforts, a large proportion of newly confirmed TB patients could not adhere to standard TB treatment, and patients' lost to follow-up was still a serious problem. Poor treatment supervision and heavy financial burden might be the main causes for non-adherence. More needs to be done to enhance treatment supervision policies and financial supports to both health providers and TB patients.", "prediction_text": "The adherence to TB treatment in China is suboptimal, with approximately 36.0% of newly confirmed TB patients missing at least one dose or follow-up re-examination during the treatment course. Factors associated with non-adherence include lack of direct observation and high monthly service expenses."}
{"answers": "While not providing conclusive evidence, this single institution experience suggests that neoadjuvant chemotherapy for Stage IV NPC patients improves both survival and disease control. Recurrence within the irradiated volume was the most prevalent mode of failure and future studies will evaluate regimens to enhance local regional control.", "prediction_text": "Induction chemotherapy improves local control and overall survival in patients with advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma, particularly in those with undifferentiated or poorly differentiated subtypes."}
{"answers": "There was increased expression of TGF-\u03b21 and VEGF in polyps compared to adjacent normal endometrial tissue. It suggested that these cytokines might play a role in endometrial polyp formation. In addition, there was a significant correlation between steroid receptor expression and VEGF and TGF-\u03b21 expression.", "prediction_text": "Yes, endometrial polyp formation is associated with increased expression of both vascular endothelial growth factor and transforming growth factor-beta1."}
{"answers": "Primary eosinophilic esophagitis is characterized by fragile esophageal mucosa that readily tears in response to minor trauma during otherwise uneventful diagnostic endoscopy. This \"cr\u00eape-paper\" sign may alert endoscopists to the presence of the disease when other mucosal alterations are lacking. Dilation is effective for patients with symptoms with minimal morbidity, despite development of disquieting lesions in response to the procedure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, fragile esophageal mucosa, also referred to as \"cr\u00eape-paper\" mucosa, is a pathognomonic endoscopic sign of primary eosinophilic esophagitis."}
{"answers": "Preoperative platelet count is a predictive factor for long-term survival in ESCC, especially in nodal-positive patients. We conclude that 205 (\u00d710(9)/L) may be the optimum cutoff point for platelet count in predicting survival in ESCC patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, preoperative platelet count is an independent prognostic factor in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. A platelet count \u2264 205 (\u00d7 10(9)/L) is associated with a better 5-year survival in patients with positive lymph node involvement."}
{"answers": "From this study we conclude that there is no increase in testicular atrophy in patients less than 13 months.", "prediction_text": "Orchiopexy before the age of 13 months is associated with a lower risk of testicular atrophy compared to orchiopexy at older ages, but the location of the testicle is a stronger predictor of atrophy."}
{"answers": "The results suggest that a longer duration of treatment may prevent return into mental health care in some groups. However, because of the design of the study, no causal inference can be drawn. Further research, preferably in a RCT, is needed to determine whether the trend towards lower intensity treatments is associated with repeated mental health care use.", "prediction_text": "Shorter durations of psychological treatment for depression are associated with a slightly increased risk of relapse and the need for additional treatment episodes."}
{"answers": "Written information sheets contribute to the process of informed consent. As patients' recall of information is generally poor, the sheets may also be useful medicolegally, as a permanent record of what was discussed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a written information sheet for informed consent in total hip arthroplasty patients significantly improves their recall of the consent interview compared to verbal information alone."}
{"answers": "Although theoretically plausible, bicompartmental knee arthroplasty was not superior in knee muscle strength and physical performance at 1 year compared with total knee arthroplasty.", "prediction_text": "According to this study, there was no significant difference in knee muscle strength and physical performance between bicompartmental knee arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty groups at any time point."}
{"answers": "These results indicate that T-cell deficiency may affect spatial learning performance following toluene exposure.", "prediction_text": "T-cell deficiency may affect the spatial learning ability following toluene exposure, as shown by a longer escape latency and poor retention memory in nude mice compared to wild-type mice in the acquisition and probe trials, respectively. However, the effect of toluene on the escape latency was not significant in nude mice."}
{"answers": "Histology usually demonstrated moderate to severe inflammation when VLEM were present. VLEM may be a highly specific endoscopic feature of esophagitis in children.", "prediction_text": "The presence of vertical lines in distal esophageal mucosa (VLEM) is a specific but not sensitive indicator of esophagitis in children, particularly eosinophilic esophagitis of moderate to severe intensity."}
{"answers": "At the gas flows studied, HFNC are not noisier than BCPAP for preterm infants.", "prediction_text": "Based on the study findings, there is no significant difference in average noise levels between high flow nasal cannulas and bubble CPAP at the external auditory meatus for preterm infants. However, high flow nasal cannulas were quieter than bubble CPAP at low frequency (500 Hz). Noise levels increased with increasing gas flows for both types of devices, but only for bubble CPAP was this increase statistically significant."}
{"answers": "Patients with a history of ACD are at an increased risk of having recurrent preterm birth and cervical shortening in a subsequent pregnancy compared with women with prior preterm birth associated PPROM or PTL.", "prediction_text": "Women with a history of advanced cervical dilatation in a prior preterm birth have a higher risk of recurrent preterm birth compared to those with a history of preterm premature rupture of membranes or preterm labor."}
{"answers": "This illustrates that Paget's disease does exist in India and a high index of suspicion is required to clinch the diagnosis.", "prediction_text": "Yes, Paget's disease of bone has been documented in India with a reported mean age of presentation around 50 years, a male to female ratio of 2.5:1, and common clinical manifestations including backache, headache, bone pains, and involvement of the skull and spine. The disease was polyostotic in 71.4% of cases and monoostotic in 28.6%. Serum alkaline phosphatase levels were significantly reduced after treatment with bisphosphonates."}
{"answers": "The results of the present study show that idiopathic incidental misty mesentery appearance has a significant prevalence. Also, the high body mass index of these patients and the growing evidence of obesity-induced inflammatory changes in adipose tissue are suggestive of an association between obesity and misty mesentery appearance on CT.", "prediction_text": "The prevalence of incidentally detected idiopathic misty mesentery on multidetector computed tomography is approximately 7%. Obesity is a common indication for CT examination and was found in 67.5% of the cases. However, the study did not establish a causal relationship between obesity and idiopathic misty mesentery."}
{"answers": "Percutaneous ethanol injection without aspiration of ethanol-mixed fluid seems to be the preferable method of treatment of benign cystic thyroid nodules from the perspective of both the physician and the patient.", "prediction_text": "The study found no significant difference in the success rates of complete disappearance of the cystic portion of the thyroid nodule between percutaneous ethanol injection with and without aspiration of ethanol-mixed fluid. However, aspiration of ethanol-mixed fluid resulted in more intracystic hemorrhages and longer procedure times due to additional procedures."}
{"answers": "The present study, which is based on internationally accepted assessment tools for SLE patients, shows a significant relationship between increased disease activity and reduced physical function. This result emphasizes the importance of optimizing treatment aiming at reducing disease activity.", "prediction_text": "In SLE patients, increased disease activity as measured by the BILAG index is associated with reduced physical function, while greater damage as measured by the SLICC/ACR damage index (SDI) is associated with reduced role function due to emotional limitations. Age and disease duration do not show any significant correlation with health status."}
{"answers": "The morbidity associated with desmoid tumors has not been shown to differ, whether they arise after restorative proctocolectomy or ileorectal anastomosis.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find a significant difference in the clinical course, morbidity, or requirement for stoma between patients with intra-abdominal desmoid disease following restorative proctocolectomy with IPAA and those with ileorectal anastomosis. However, the small sample size limits the conclusions that can be drawn from this study."}
{"answers": "These findings provide evidence for the existence of a high-IQ variant of schizophrenia that is associated with markedly fewer negative symptoms than typical schizophrenia, and lends support to the idea of a psychosis spectrum or continuum over boundaried diagnostic categories.", "prediction_text": "Schizophrenia patients with high pre-morbid intelligence and minimal post-onset IQ decline may represent a clinically distinct subtype, as they exhibit lower levels of negative and disorganized symptoms, better global functioning, and higher levels of manic symptoms compared to typical schizophrenia patients."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that hearing loss caused by GM otic drops may be reduced by the inclusion of BM and benzalkonium chloride. Our finding that BM alone was associated with hearing loss suggests that the benzalkonium chloride may be the protective agent in combination otic drops.", "prediction_text": "In this study, betamethasone did not provide protection against cochlear toxicity when given with otic gentamicin in mice."}
{"answers": "A fetal anatomic survey on follow-up sonograms may identify unanticipated fetal anomalies, especially when the indication is for fetal growth.", "prediction_text": "Yes, fetal anatomic assessment on follow-up antepartum sonograms can lead to the detection of unanticipated fetal anomalies, which may require neonatal intervention. The study found that repeated sonography for fetal growth evaluation had a higher incidence of unexpected fetal anomalies compared to sonography for other reasons. Additionally, neonates whose mothers had sonographic examinations for fetal growth had a higher rate of neonatal interventions compared to those in the nongrowth indications group."}
{"answers": "Patients with BRAF-mutant PTC had a significantly longer PFS than BRAF wild-type when treated with TKIs. However, due to the small number of BRAF-mutant patients, further investigations are required, especially to understand the potential positive effect of BRAF mutations in RAIR TC patients while having a negative prognostic impact in RAI-sensitive PTC patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the identification of specific mutations, particularly BRAF, in radioiodine-refractory thyroid cancers can provide useful information for guiding therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. However, the histological subtype of poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma is also an independent prognostic factor for progression-free survival."}
{"answers": "The frequency and topographic distribution of LNM are not modified by NACT, and clinical non-responders showed more involved LNs. A systemic and extensive lymphadenectomy should be performed in patients treated with NACT plus surgery regardless of the response to NACT.", "prediction_text": "Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) can reduce the incidence and extent of lymph node metastasis in cervical cancer, but the effect on the topographical distribution patterns varies. The deep inguinal and para-aortic lymph node groups are less likely to be affected. Factors such as clinical response, deep stromal invasion, parametrial invasion, lymph vascular invasion, number of lymph nodes involved, response to NACT, tumor histology, and a positive vaginal margin can influence the prognosis in node-positive patients treated with NACT plus radical surgery."}
{"answers": "A prior benign prostate biopsy may be independently associated with more favorable surgical and biochemical outcomes after prostatectomy. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings.", "prediction_text": "Prior benign prostate biopsy is associated with more favorable pathologic features and improved biochemical disease-free survival, especially for patients with more aggressive disease, in patients undergoing radical perineal prostatectomy for prostate cancer."}
{"answers": "This clinical trial evaluated the possible reduction in intervention-related myocardial damage that was attributable to remote postischemic conditioning.", "prediction_text": "Remote ischemic postconditioning may reduce myocardial lesions associated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), but its protective effect might be less pronounced in diabetic patients. The study showed that three cycles of ischemia in the non-dominant arm by inflating a cuff to 200 mm Hg (remote postischemic conditioning) resulted in a lower maximum increase in troponin in the first 24 hours compared to the placebo group. However, the study did not find a significant difference in readmission due to heart failure or cardiovascular mortality after 1 year of follow-up between the two groups. The protective effect of remote postischemic conditioning in diab"}
{"answers": "These results indicate that prophylactic treatment with edaravone prevents I/R-induced ovarian damage during pneumoperitoneum in an experimental rat model.", "prediction_text": "Edaravone offers protection against ischemia/reperfusion-induced ovarian damage in rats, as evidenced by a reduction in follicular degeneration and edema, decreased caspase-3 expression, and attenuation of oxidative stress markers."}
{"answers": "Sonography has no place in the diagnosis of undescended testis.", "prediction_text": "Ultrasonography can be useful in the evaluation of boys with an undescended testis, but it has limitations and may not detect all cases, particularly retractile testes or abdominal testes. Clinical examination by a paediatric surgeon remains essential for proper diagnosis."}
{"answers": "Mammographic density is not associated with an increased need for re-excision or resection of unnecessary margins at initial BCS.", "prediction_text": "Mammographic density did not consistently show an independent association with the margin re-excision rate after breast-conserving surgery in this study. However, patients with denser breasts had a higher rate of initial mastectomy and a trend toward requiring more frequent re-excision. The rate of unnecessary margins did not differ by breast density. The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ and the resection of additional margins were significant predictors of re-excision."}
{"answers": "Septal suturing after septoplasty offers the following advantages: elimination of discomfort for the patients, minimal complications, the outcome is almost the same as with nasal packing, and finally the hospital stay is less than with nasal packing. Therefore, suturing of the nasal septum after septoplasty should be a preferred alternative to nasal packing.", "prediction_text": "Based on the study, suturing of the nasal septum after septoplasty is associated with fewer cases of minor oozing, bleeding, septal hematoma, and septal perforation compared to nasal packing. However, the operating time is longer in the suturing group. The incidence of postoperative adhesions and remnant deviated nasal septum is similar in both groups."}
{"answers": "The present study does not support the recommendation of ultrasound as a conclusive diagnostic tool for internal derangements of the temporomandibular joint.", "prediction_text": "While ultrasound has limitations in the detection of internal derangements of the temporomandibular joint due to its lower sensitivity compared to magnetic resonance imaging, it can still be a useful tool in certain situations where access for other imaging modalities is difficult or not feasible."}
{"answers": "Our results showed that the serum leptin level has no prognostic indications in advanced lung cancer patients. Leptin is decreased in lung cancer, and there is lack of correlation with tumour\u2011related factors including prognosis. Therefore, leptin is not a useful clinical marker in lung cancer (Tab. 2, Fig. 2, Ref. 22).", "prediction_text": "The serum leptin levels at diagnosis are not a significant prognostic factor in advanced lung cancer. However, there is a correlation between serum leptin levels and BMI in lung cancer patients."}
{"answers": "We found no evidence of serovar specific immunity in our population. It remains possible that populations with a higher prevalence of gonorrhoea and more frequent infections may have a quantitatively greater immune response.", "prediction_text": "The data from this study suggests that there is limited or no serovar-specific immunity to Neisseria gonorrhoeae, as there was no significant difference in the prevalence of serovars isolated following a repeat infection compared to those without repeat infections."}
{"answers": "BPPV is associated with positive viral serology, particularly during certain months of the year, mainly in spring and autumn. Viral infection might promote BPPV attacks due to the development of vestibulopathy or induce secondary BPPV via viral infection-related neurolabyrinthitis.", "prediction_text": "Several viral infections, including HSV1, Herpes zoster, adenovirus, and CMV, have been associated with an increased risk of developing benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), with seasonal variation observed for some viruses."}
{"answers": "We found increased post-ictal serum cytokine levels in patients with several epilepsy syndromes.", "prediction_text": "Elevated serum levels of certain cytokines, particularly IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha, have been associated with epilepsy, with stronger correlations observed in males, those with a positive family history, longer duration of epilepsy, and in patients with status epilepticus. Decreased levels of these cytokines were noted during the seizure-free period."}
{"answers": "Neuromedin U reduces insulin and increases somatostatin secretion. Blockade of somatostatin action abolishes the inhibition of insulin secretion by NmU. The results of the study suggest that somatostatin mediates the inhibitory action of NmU on insulin secretion.", "prediction_text": "Yes, somatostatin plays a role in mediating the insulinostatic effects of Neuromedin U in the rat pancreas by stimulating somatostatin secretion and inhibiting insulin secretion."}
{"answers": "Patients with fewer or anterior sutures have shorter OR times. However, 30-day readmission, band-related reoperation, and postoperative weight loss were unaffected by number or location of suture. The technical aspects of HHR did not appear to be associated with readmission or reoperation, and therefore a standardized approach may not be necessary.", "prediction_text": "In this retrospective study, the number and location of sutures used for hiatal hernia repair during laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding did not significantly affect length of stay, 30-day readmission, band-related reoperation, or postoperative BMI/%EWL. However, patients with fewer sutures had a shorter operating room time, and those with anterior suture placement had a shorter operating room time and shorter length of stay compared to posterior or both placement."}
{"answers": "Survivors of lobar ICH with atrial fibrillation should not be offered long-term anticoagulation. Similarly, most patients with deep hemispheric ICH and atrial fibrillation should not receive anticoagulant therapy. However, patients with deep hemispheric ICH at particularly high risk for thromboembolic stroke or low risk of ICH recurrence might benefit from long-term anticoagulation.", "prediction_text": "The decision to anticoagulate a patient with a history of intracerebral hemorrhage and a clear indication for anticoagulation, such as nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, is complex. A decision-analysis model suggests that for patients with prior lobar ICH, withholding anticoagulation therapy is preferred. However, for patients with prior deep hemispheric ICH, the model shows a smaller gain in quality-adjusted life years with withholding anticoagulation, and anticoagulation could be considered if the risk of thromboembolic stroke is particularly high."}
{"answers": "This study showed that FDG is not a good surrogate tracer for tumor hypoxia under either ambient or hypoxic conditions. Only specific hypoxia tracers should be used to measure tumor hypoxia.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that there is a decreasing similarity between the distribution of (14)C-EF3 and (18)F-FDG under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. However, under hypoxic conditions, a higher dice similarity index was observed between (14)C-EF3 and (18)F-FDG in SCCVII tumors. These findings indicate that (18)F-FDG can be used as a surrogate tracer to measure tumor hypoxia, but the results are not consistent across all tumor types."}
{"answers": "A task-specific intervention designed to improve gait speed may potentially provide secondary benefits by positively impacting depression, mobility and social participation for people post stroke.", "prediction_text": "Treadmill training in the chronic stage of stroke recovery can lead to significant improvements in depression, mobility, and social participation. However, these benefits were not observed in the control group."}
{"answers": "Orthostatic myoclonus is often underdiagnosed and can be considered a possible cause of unsteadiness in subjects with neurodegenerative diseases. Electromyography surface recording is thereby an aid for investigating unsteadiness of unknown origin.", "prediction_text": "Orthostatic myoclonus is a common cause of unsteadiness and gait impairment, particularly in patients with neurodegenerative disorders. The study found that 17.2% of subjects with unexplained unsteadiness had orthostatic myoclonus, making it the most frequent disorder identified. The majority of these patients also had an underlying neurodegenerative condition. While some patients showed improvement with antimyoclonic treatment, further research is needed to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of treatment for orthostatic myoclonus."}
{"answers": "Severely injured patients treated at a level III center had a higher mortality rate than those treated at a level I center. Most problems identified occurred in the emergency department and were related to delays in care provision. This research highlights the importance of efficient prehospital, in-hospital, and regional trauma systems, performance monitoring, peer review, and adherence to protocols and guidelines.", "prediction_text": "In this Australian study, severely injured trauma patients with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) >15 who were treated at a level III trauma center had a significantly higher risk of death compared to those treated at a level I center, even after adjusting for age, sex, ISS, and prehospital time. The increased risk of mortality was attributed to issues in care delivery at the level III center, including technical errors, delays in decision making, and errors of judgement."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that very few genes, which change their expression level during the WOI, show a quantitative homogeneous expression in endometrially-receptive patients. In conclusion, in this study only six genes showed a homogeneous expression, and are probably involved in embryo implantation mechanisms.", "prediction_text": "Among the 43 genes analyzed in the study, only six genes (VEGFA, PLA2G2A, ALPL, LIF, NNMT, and STC1) showed a statistically uniform expression among women who became pregnant in a subsequent ICSI cycle. The expression levels of the other genes varied significantly."}
{"answers": "While SSA would be the first region to experience the huge benefits of implementing the \"test and treat\" policy of the WHO, the region is not yet prepared to manage the consequential increased burden of ART-related toxic and metabolic complications. Urgent measures should be taken to fill the lacunae if SSA is not to become over-burdened by the consequences of the \"test and treat\" policy.", "prediction_text": "Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in managing the anticipated increase in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-related adverse effects due to the \"test and treat\" policy of the World Health Organization. The region's weak health systems, inadequate resources, and high prevalence of ART-related comorbidities may hinder its ability to effectively address this issue."}
{"answers": "In summary we believe sudden onset chest wall rigidity may be a significant and previously unreported factor leading to an increased mortality, from illicit IV fentanyl use. Fentanyl and norfentanyl ratios and concentrations suggest a more rapid onset of death given the finding of fentanyl without norfentanyl in many of the fatalities. Chest wall rigidity may help explain the cause of death in these instances, in contrast to the typical opioid-related overdose deaths. Intravenous heroin users should be educated regarding this potentially fatal complication given the increasingly common substitution and combination with heroin of fentanyl.", "prediction_text": "Yes, acute chest wall rigidity caused by rapid intravenous fentanyl administration may contribute to rapid fatalities in illicit fentanyl abuse. The lack of detectable norfentanyl in some cases suggests a very rapid onset of chest wall rigidity leading to respiratory arrest."}
{"answers": "There appears to be no benefit in metformin co-treatment before and during IVF in women with PCO without any other features of PCOS. Clinical Trials.gov: NCT01046032.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find a significant increase in live birth rates or reduction in severe OHSS rates for women with polycystic morphology ovaries but no other features of PCOS, when treated with metformin during IVF."}
{"answers": "The study suggests that ventilating an adult patient is possible with a smaller, pediatric-sized BVM. The tidal volumes recorded with the pediatric BVM were more consistent with lung-protective ventilation volumes.", "prediction_text": "EMS providers can provide tidal volumes within the recommended range when using a pediatric-sized BVM in simulated adult-sized patients. The pediatric BVM provides lower median tidal volumes compared to an adult BVM, which may be beneficial in adhering to lung-protective ventilation protocols."}
{"answers": "Our results suggest that colonoscopy does not affect the management of patients with acute diverticulitis nor alter the outcome. The current practice of a routine colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis, diagnosed by typical clinical symptoms and CT needs to be reevaluated.", "prediction_text": "Colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis does not significantly impact management as no new or different diagnoses were made, and no colonic malignancies were detected in this study."}
{"answers": "Pretreatment ECG is of limited value for patients with an unremarkable cardiovascular history and a normal heart rate and blood pressure. Hypotension may occur during treatment.", "prediction_text": "Cardiovascular evaluation, including electrocardiogram (ECG), is recommended prior to initiating beta-blocker therapy for infantile hemangiomas, as there is a low incidence of cardiovascular side effects, but parents reported a high rate of side effects during treatment."}
{"answers": "Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is a promising option for lifelong treatment of type 2 diabetes. It has the potential to improve or cure a selected spectrum of type 1 diabetes when performed early in the disease. Further animal model studies or randomized controlled trials are needed to support our conclusion.", "prediction_text": "Roux-en-Y gastric bypass has been shown to be highly effective in managing type 2 diabetes in obese patients, but its application in type 1 diabetes is still under investigation. The study suggests that gastric bypass could potentially provide a long-term solution for a selected spectrum of diabetes mellitus. However, more research is needed to determine its effectiveness and safety in type 1 diabetes."}
{"answers": "Collectively, results suggest that behavioral adaptation to ESC is likely in certain drivers; however, its proven effectiveness in reducing the likelihood of being involved in a serious crash probably outweighs any potential increases in unsafe driving. To fully benefit from ESC, vehicle manufacturers are encouraged to market ESC-equipped vehicles in a realistic, safe manner. Driver training and safety organizations are also encouraged to provide balanced educational information about ESC to their members.", "prediction_text": "Yes, some ESC drivers reported noticeable changes in their driving behavior after using the technology. However, not all drivers are aware of ESC or its benefits, indicating a need for continued education and awareness efforts."}
{"answers": "The results of the study demonstrate that when clinical supervision uses best practice principles, it can provide professional support for allied health workers, even during times of rapid organisational change.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that effective clinical supervision, as perceived by allied health professionals, can contribute positively to the workforce in the healthcare landscape. Factors such as the length and number of supervision sessions, as well as having a choice in the allocation of a clinical supervisor and having a completed clinical supervision agreement, were associated with higher perceived effectiveness."}
{"answers": "Both 'economic/employment' and 'social/welfare' dimensions of social exclusion significantly influence suicide mortality among males. The influence of 'economic/employment' and 'social/welfare' dimensions of social exclusion on female suicide mortality is controversial. Social exclusion might be considered as a risk factor for suicide mortality in Europe.", "prediction_text": "Yes, both the 'economic/employment' and 'social/welfare' dimensions of social exclusion have a significant negative influence on suicide mortality in Europe for both males and females, with a stronger effect observed for the 'social/welfare' dimension among females."}
{"answers": "While ultrasound examination is inexpensive and easily done, it is not accurate enough for staging small penile cancers located at the glans penis. However, for larger tumors ultrasound can be a useful addition to physical examination by delineating reliably the anatomic relations of the tumor to structures such as the tunica albuginea, corpus cavernosum, and urethra.", "prediction_text": "Ultrasound examination can be a useful adjunct in the clinical staging of squamous cell carcinoma of the penis, particularly in assessing the extent of invasion into the corpora, specifically the tunica albuginea of the corpus cavernosum. However, it has limitations in differentiating invasion into the subepithelial tissue and the corpus spongiosum, and in accurately measuring tumor thickness."}
{"answers": "This study confirms that a large percentage of patients use metered-dose inhalers improperly. It also demonstrates a significant lack of understanding by health care providers of the proper use of metered-dose inhalers. Furthermore, this study supports the use of respiratory care practitioners in the outpatient setting, since they were the most proficient among all the health care providers in the proper use of metered-dose inhalers.", "prediction_text": "Health care providers, particularly house staff and nursing staff, may have a poor understanding of the proper use of metered-dose inhalers, and may need additional education and training to effectively teach patients."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrated that the regional or global apex of a given curve is the most rotated level in only a minority of the curves. The most rotated level may be as far as two levels from the global apex and one level from the regional apex.", "prediction_text": "In adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, the transverse apex (most rotated vertebra or disc) and coronal apex (regional or global) do not always coincide and may differ by up to two levels."}
{"answers": "Generalization of the RCT sample was supported, because only 7.8% of Phenomenology subjects did not fit the RCT criteria. Nevertheless, because the RCT subjects were more severely ill, it is unclear if treatment findings from the RCT will be applicable to children with less severe mania.", "prediction_text": "The \"Treatment of Early Age Mania (TEAM)\" sample, which was recruited from media and community sources, had similar demographic characteristics and long episode duration as the \"Phenomenology\" sample obtained by consecutive new case ascertainment. However, the TEAM sample had a higher prevalence of mania symptoms, ultradian rapid cycling, psychosis, and suicidality. The representativeness of the TEAM sample in terms of diagnostic characteristics of child bipolar I disorder requires further investigation."}
{"answers": "Experts across Europe asserted the right to culturally sensitive health care for all immigrants. There is a broad consensus among experts about the major principles of good practice that need to be implemented across Europe. However, there also is some disagreement both within and between countries on specific issues that require further research and debate.", "prediction_text": "While there is a broad European consensus on many factors characterizing good practice in health care for immigrants, discordance remains both within and between countries on specific issues such as prioritizing cultural differences and consistent governance of health care services."}
{"answers": "Biochemical analysis of injured cervical intervertebral disks reveals the presence of inflammatory markers such as MCP, fragments of structural matrix proteins such as FAC, and a correlation with pH. Further evaluation of the FAC as a potential diagnostic biomarker or therapeutic target is warranted in the cervical spine.", "prediction_text": "The fibronectin-aggrecan complex was detected in the lavage fluid of patients undergoing cervical diskectomy for radiculopathy caused by disk herniation. The correlation between MCP and the fibronectin-aggrecan complex was statistically significant."}
{"answers": "Affect-regulated exercise to feel 'good' can be used in a training programme to regulate exercise intensity. This approach led to a 19% increase in time to reach ventilatory threshold, which is indicative of improved fitness.", "prediction_text": "Yes, training at an intensity that feels \"good\" through an affect-regulated exercise program can lead to improved fitness, as indicated by an increase in time to reach ventilatory threshold in the training group in this study. However, the exercise intensities in this study were in the lower range of recommended guidelines for cardiovascular health."}
{"answers": "In Southern Italy, hepatitis G virus infection is widespread among patients with chronic hepatitis, independently of parenteral risk factors. Its frequency in subjects with cryptogenic liver disease parallels that observed in hepatitis C virus chronic liver disease, thus ruling out an aetiologic role of hepatitis G virus. TT virus infection is uncommon in patients with cryptogenic or hepatitis C virus-related liver disease who do not have a history of parenteral exposure.", "prediction_text": "Hepatitis G virus was present in 17.4% of patients with cryptogenic chronic liver disease and 15% of patients with hepatitis C virus-related chronic liver disease. TT virus was present in 3 subjects, one with cryptogenic and two with hepatitis C virus-related chronic liver disease. However, the study did not find a significant difference in the prevalence of these viruses between the two groups. Therefore, the role of hepatitis G virus and TT virus in cryptogenic chronic liver disease remains unclear based on the findings of this study."}
{"answers": "Our findings suggest that somatic complaints may represent one, but not necessarily the most important, risk factor for the subsequent development of depressive symptoms in women in nonclinical populations. The results also highlight the importance of including social variables in studies on women's depression as well as conducting additional research to further examine predictors of depressive symptoms in men.", "prediction_text": "In this prospective study, somatic complaints, as measured by the SCL-90-R somatization subscale, predicted subsequent symptoms of depression, as measured by the CES-D scale, 5 years later, but only in women. However, somatic complaints were a less powerful predictor than income and age."}
{"answers": "Peak inspiratory pressure, PEEP, and ventilation index values could distinguish survivors from nonsurvivors by day 3. This may assist in early application of supportive nonconventional therapies in children with malignancy and ARDS.", "prediction_text": "Peak inspiratory pressure, positive end-expiratory pressure, and ventilation index values in the first three days, and respiratory data related to oxygenation efficiency from day 8, can help predict the outcome in children with hemato-oncology malignancy and acute respiratory distress syndrome."}
{"answers": "In this small study serum inhibin concentrations higher than those found in the early follicular phase one to two weeks after evacuation of a hydatidiform mole seemed to be specific for persistent trophoblastic disease. Further data are needed to confirm these promising results.", "prediction_text": "Elevated inhibin concentrations in both serum and tissue are associated with hydatidiform mole and can be used as a clinical marker for this condition. However, inhibin levels may decline to normal values after evacuation of the mole, and low post-evacuation inhibin levels may indicate a reduced risk of persistent trophoblastic disease."}
{"answers": "The integration of whole-lesion dynamic data tends to improve specificity. However, no statistical significance backs up this finding.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that while the most suspect curve analysis using CAD in MRM has diagnostic accuracy, the curve-type distribution percentage and combined dynamic data show higher diagnostic accuracy. However, the differences did not achieve statistical significance. Therefore, the need for whole lesion time curve distribution analysis in CAD for MRM is still under debate."}
{"answers": "The seemingly exaggerated traditional fear of anaphylaxis seems to discourage surgeons from more widely adopting minimal access techniques for the treatment of hydatid cyst.", "prediction_text": "Yes, fear of anaphylaxis is a significant reason why surgeons in northern Jordan are not more widely adopting percutaneous and laparoscopic techniques for the treatment of liver hydatid cysts."}
{"answers": "Grandmultiparous women had increased maternal and neonatal morbidity, and neonatal mortality even after controlling for confounders, suggesting a need for closer observation than regular multiparous patients during labor and delivery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, grandmultiparity is an independent risk factor for various adverse perinatal outcomes, including abruptio placentae, preterm delivery, fetal macrosomia, neonatal death, postpartum hemorrhage, and blood transfusion."}
{"answers": "No single data source is likely to provide a complete health profile for an individual. For women with depression in pregnancy and dispensed antidepressants, the hospital admission data do not adequately capture all cases.", "prediction_text": "There is a discrepancy in the identification of major depression in pregnancy between hospital admission datasets and dispensing claims datasets. The study found that only about 13.6% of pregnant women identified in both datasets had a record of depression in both, suggesting that a significant number of cases may be missed in hospital admission datasets. The true prevalence of major depression in pregnancy is estimated to be around 16%."}
{"answers": "These data suggest a pattern of diagnostic stability over time for manic and mixed episodes in patients with bipolar disorder. Careful prospective studies of this issue are needed.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that the manic/mixed episode distinction in bipolar disorder is stable over time."}
{"answers": "The analyses show that structural characteristics of a practice are not associated with uptake of a new IT facility, but that its use may be influenced by post-graduate education in the relevant clinical condition. For this diabetes system at least, practice nurse use was critical in spreading uptake beyond initial GP enthusiasts and for sustained and rising use in subsequent years.", "prediction_text": "The number of diabetes-educated staff in a general practice is positively associated with the uptake and use of an IT innovation in primary care."}
{"answers": "GAPS, a simple clinical score, is a better predictor of admission than triage nurses, unless the nurse is sure about the outcome, in which case their clinical judgement should be respected.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the objective triage score (GAPS) performs similarly to nurses in predicting admission at triage, but with better calibration and discrimination. However, when clinical certainty is high among nurses, their performance is excellent, and combining their judgment with the objective score can further improve accuracy."}
{"answers": "Our data showed no difference in 25(OH) D levels between normal children and those with CD when adjusted for body mass index.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find a significant difference in vitamin D levels between prepubertal children with celiac disease and those without the condition. However, obese children with celiac disease had lower vitamin D levels compared to non-obese children without celiac disease."}
{"answers": "Granulomatous myelotoxicity and enteritis developed in a 21 year old female within 3 weeks of initiating sulfasalazine for rheumatoid arthritis. Following a short course of corticosteroids, the patient had resolution of her cholestatic hepatitis, rash, eosinophilia, and gastrointestinal symptoms with no residual manifestations at 7 months follow-up. Although severe reactions to sulfasalazine are rare and unpredictable, practicing physicians should be aware of unusual clinical presentations of toxicity when prescribing sulfasalazine.", "prediction_text": "The medical paper does not provide enough information to determine if the patient has Crohn's disease. The patient is only identified as having rheumatoid arthritis."}
{"answers": "Healthy lifestyles lead to an increase in the utilization of preventive health services. However, there is not much significantly reducing the number of outpatient visits in people with health behaviors. Specifically, people with regular exercise habits and who take their blood pressure measurement regularly have an increased number of outpatient visits. It is suggested that more available and accessible health consultation services be provided to inculcate in the general public the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that certain health behaviors, such as exercise habits, dietary habits, regular blood pressure measurement, and drinking habits, can impact the utilization of healthcare resources. Specifically, healthier lifestyles may lead to fewer healthcare visits and examinations, but further research is needed to establish a causal relationship."}
{"answers": "Parental restriction of R-rated movie viewing is associated with both lower adolescent smoking susceptibility and lower smoking rates.", "prediction_text": "Yes, parental restriction of R-rated movie viewing is associated with a lower adolescent smoking susceptibility."}
{"answers": "Having a usual physician can be an effective tool in improving access to care for low-income populations, although it is most effective when combined with insurance coverage. However, the effectiveness of managed care in linking more low-income persons to a medical home is uncertain, and may have unintended consequences for uninsured persons.", "prediction_text": "In low-income populations, high managed care penetration is associated with a lower likelihood of having a usual source of care, contrary to the intended goal of managed care programs."}
{"answers": "Locally 1.0% ropivacaine administration significantly relieves the pain of pediatric tonsillectomy and, it is a safe and effective method. High concentrations of ropivaciane may produce clinically significant pain relief. It is more effective to reduce of post-operative analgesic requirement after first hour.", "prediction_text": "Topical application of ropivacaine hydrochloride in the first hour following adenotonsillectomy does not reduce post-operative morbidity in pediatric patients, but it provides significant pain relief in the following hours and days. No significant differences were observed in other post-operative parameters or complications between the ropivacaine and control groups."}
{"answers": "Minimally invasive mitral valve repair using neochords provided a high rate of repair, reproducible results in a routine cardiac surgery setting and stable repair during follow-up. This has become our preferred technique for mitral valve surgery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, minimally invasive mitral valve repair using artificial chords is a reproducible and applicable approach in routine surgery, with good outcomes and no reported cases of recurrent mitral regurgitation or reoperation."}
{"answers": "Comparisons of absolute EOA values grouped by the manufacturers' valve sizes are misleading because of specific differences in geometric dimensions. The EOA:patient aortic annulus area ratio provides a new hemodynamic index which may facilitate objective comparisons between different valve types.", "prediction_text": "The effective orifice area (EOA) to patient aortic annulus area ratio can be used to adjust for variables such as patient anatomy and valve dimensions when comparing the hemodynamic performance of different bioprostheses. However, according to this study, there was no significant difference in EOA/patient aortic annulus area ratio between the Medtronic Mosaic and Edwards Perimount bioprostheses."}
{"answers": "Women compared to men often delay seeking treatment for an AMI, which further increases their risks. Our findings suggest specific characteristics that can serve as a profile to those African Americans most likely to delay seeking treatment for AMI.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that women who were alone when symptoms began and those who were not advised to call 911 had longer delays in seeking medical help for an acute myocardial infarction compared to men. Additionally, men with emergency room insurance delayed longer than men without it. However, the overall delay time was longer for women than men, but the difference was not significant."}
{"answers": "A reduced alveolar macrophage phagocytic host response to apoptotic cells or NTHi may contribute to neutrophilic inflammation and NTHi colonization in both PBB and bronchiectasis. Whether this mechanism also contributes to the progression of PBB to bronchiectasis remains unknown.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that children with protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) have impaired alveolar macrophage phagocytic function, which may contribute to the development of bronchiectasis. The findings of lower phagocytic capacity for apoptotic cells and NTHi, reduced mannose receptor expression, and increased IL-1\u03b2 in both PBB and bronchiectasis groups support this hypothesis."}
{"answers": "Cervical physical therapy can have a positive effect on subjective tinnitus complaints in patients with a combination of tinnitus and neck complaints. Larger studies, using more responsive outcome measures, are however necessary to prove this effect.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that multi-modal cervical physical therapy can provide short-term improvement of tinnitus symptoms in patients with cervicogenic somatic tinnitus, with approximately half of the patients experiencing substantial improvement immediately after treatment. However, the effect was maintained in only a quarter of the patients after a six-week follow-up."}
{"answers": "Because workers may have an elevated relative aerobic workload for several hours each working day, this relationship may elucidate a mechanism behind the increased risk for cardiovascular disease among workers exposed to high levels of occupational physical activity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a positive relationship exists between aerobic workload and ambulatory blood pressure. A 1% increase in mean relative aerobic workload is associated with a significant increase in both systolic and diastolic ambulatory blood pressure."}
{"answers": "Our investigation did not undoubtedly prove that significant changes of fetal biometric parameters occurred in the last three decades. It is possible that secular growth acceleration does not exist in prenatal period but also the observed time period could have been short for this phenomenon to manifest.", "prediction_text": "Based on the information provided in the research paper, there was no evidence to support the existence of secular growth acceleration during fetal life based on the examined biometric parameters."}
{"answers": "Consistent with prior studies, we found an inverse relationship between obesity and serum prostate specific antigen. However, the magnitude of the difference was small. Thus, adjusting prostate specific antigen for body mass index does not appear warranted.", "prediction_text": "The results of this study suggest that there is no significant association between prostate specific antigen and body mass index after adjusting for age in men without prostate cancer. Therefore, it may not be necessary to adjust prostate specific antigen levels for body mass index."}
{"answers": "Emergency laparotomy carries a high rate of mortality, especially in those over the age of 70 years, and more needs to be done to improve outcomes, particularly in this group. This could involve increasing acute surgical care manpower, early recognition of patients requiring emergency surgery, development of clear management protocols for such patients or perhaps even considering centralisation of emergency surgical services to specialist centres with multidisciplinary teams involving emergency surgeons and care of the elderly physicians in hospital and related community outreach services for post-discharge care.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the 30-day and 1-year mortality following emergency laparotomy are areas of concern, particularly in older adults, with higher mortality rates compared to younger patients."}
{"answers": "[corrected] This observation is exceptional in many aspects: very early age of onset of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, no immune deficit, association with a rare congenital neurological syndrome. We discuss the possible link between this entity and the occurrence of tuberculosis.", "prediction_text": "The presented case report suggests a possible association between Say-Barber-Miller syndrome and the development of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis in a child. However, further research is needed to establish a causative link between the two conditions."}
{"answers": "The signal intensity on DWI showed no significant difference in the development of vascularization.", "prediction_text": "The results of this study suggest that the classification of hypovascular hepatocellular lesions based on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) does not significantly predict the development of vascularization."}
{"answers": "General practitioners should consider using patients' first names more often, particularly with younger patients.", "prediction_text": "The acceptability of general practitioners calling patients by their first names varies among patients, with most patients either liking or not minding it, but few wanting to call their doctor by his or her first name."}
{"answers": "Patients after ART treatment suffer from higher C-section rates during their stage of delivery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, ART patients, specifically those undergoing fresh embryo transfer or slow freezing, have higher risks for both elective and emergency C-sections compared to spontaneous conception."}
{"answers": "Trauma patients have a significant complication rate related to anticoagulation therapy, and predicting which patients will develop a complication remains unclear. Prospective studies are needed to determine which treatment regimen, if any, is appropriate to safely anticoagulate this high risk population.", "prediction_text": "The use of therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients carries a risk of complications, including bleeding and hemoglobin drops requiring blood transfusions. Factors associated with an increased risk of complications include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, use of unfractionated heparin, and lower initial platelet count."}
{"answers": "A significant difference in dental health between recruits to each Service does exist and is a likely to be a reflection of the sociodemographic background from which they are drawn.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that new recruits in the British Army had a significantly greater prevalence of dental decay and greater treatment resource need compared to recruits in the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. Additionally, a higher percentage of Army recruits were from the most deprived socioeconomic backgrounds."}
{"answers": "In light of the large sample size and prior pilot testing of presented images, results suggest that episodic migraineurs do not differentially attend to headache-related facial stimuli. Given modest evidence of attentional biases among chronic headache samples, these findings suggest potential differences in attentional processing between chronic and episodic headache subforms.", "prediction_text": "The results of this study did not find evidence of selective attention to headache-related visual stimuli in episodic migraineurs compared to non-migraine controls."}
{"answers": "Under the conditions of this study, preclerkship (year 2) CPEs strongly predicted medical students at risk for failing a senior CPE. This finding opens the opportunity for remediation of deficits prior to or during clerkships.", "prediction_text": "Yes, students with low performance scores on preclerkship clinical performance examinations have a higher risk of failing a senior clinical performance examination. However, USMLE Step 1 scores also correlate with performance on the senior examination but with weaker predictive values."}
{"answers": "Our results suggest that people do not attach a simple fixed premium to \"safety-related\" interventions but that preferences depend more subtly on context. The use of the results of such public preference surveys to directly inform policy would therefore be premature.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the public places a higher value on health care interventions aimed at preventing harms caused within the health care system compared to interventions related to individual lifestyle choices or injuries, and nature-related disorders. However, the study also shows that interventions related to drug errors and injuries to health care staff are valued less than interventions for genetic disorders."}
{"answers": "Minimising the radiation dose to one of the parotid glands with the help of IMRT in patients with advanced head and neck cancers can prevent xerostomia in most patients and parotid scintigraphy is a useful method of documenting xerostomia.", "prediction_text": "Sparing one parotid gland from high radiation doses during intensity-modulated radiotherapy for head and neck cancers can reduce the incidence of xerostomia, but not completely eliminate it."}
{"answers": "It is important to continue FA supplementation over the long term in patients on methotrexate and FA in order to prevent them discontinuing treatment because of mouth ulcers or nausea and vomiting. Our data suggest that FA supplementation is also helpful in preventing neutropenia, with very little loss of efficacy of methotrexate.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that discontinuing folic acid supplementation in rheumatoid arthritis patients established on methotrexate and folic acid 5 mg daily may increase the incidence of toxicity, specifically nausea, but it did not significantly affect disease activity or methotrexate efficacy. However, the small sample size and short follow-up period limit the generalizability of these findings. Further research is needed to determine the long-term effects of discontinuing folic acid supplementation in this population."}
{"answers": "LF and cruroplasty is feasible and has good results in terms of GERD symptoms control and additional weight loss. The high rate of postoperative complications observed in this series remains a matter of concern. A re-sleeve procedure might be considered as an alternative to RYGB/DS conversion restricted to selected patients.", "prediction_text": "Fundectomy is a safe and effective revision surgery for severe GERD symptoms associated with a residual fundus or neofundus after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, resulting in improvements in symptoms and an additional %EWL of 53.4% at 24 months for patients with inadequate weight loss or weight regain."}
{"answers": "VAT area measurement at a single level 3 cm above the lower margin of the L3 vertebra is feasible and can reflect changes in VAT volume and body weight. Advances in knowledge: As VAT area at a CT slice 3cm above the lower margin of L3 can best reflect interval changes in VAT volume and body weight, VAT area measurement should be selected at this location.", "prediction_text": "The visceral adipose tissue area measurement at a level 3 cm above the lower margin of L3 shows the strongest correlation with visceral adipose tissue volume and body weight changes. Therefore, it can be used as a representative measurement for visceral adipose tissue volume."}
{"answers": "Barrett's cytokeratin 7/20 pattern can be a useful marker for the diagnosis of short-segment Barrett's oesophagus, although the false positive or false negative rate is approximately 25%.", "prediction_text": "Cytokeratin 7/20 immunoreactivity has a moderate sensitivity (77.8%) and specificity (77.5%) in the diagnosis of short-segment Barrett's oesophagus in Korea. However, its diagnostic utility is still a matter of controversy."}
{"answers": "In this paper the effect of lunar phases on the time of delivery is shown. This influence seems to be especially relevant in the case of multiparae and plurigravidae. Nevertheless, it is too weak to allow for prediction regarding the days with the highest frequency of deliveries.", "prediction_text": "There is a correlation between lunar position and the time of delivery, particularly in multiparae and plurigravidae, who tend to deliver around the first or second day after a full moon."}
{"answers": "Financial incentives for smoking cessation in pregnancy are highly cost-effective, with an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life years of \u00a3482, which is well below recommended decision thresholds.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that financial incentives up to \u00a3400 for smoking cessation during pregnancy can be cost-effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of \u00a3482/QALY ($734/QALY), but there is uncertainty due to potential relapse after birth. The expected value of perfect information is \u00a330 million, indicating that further research may be worthwhile."}
{"answers": "This data demonstrates the robust nature of the short stay ward. At these two very different institutions we have shown improved bed efficient and patient care in a cost-effective way. We have also reported on greater parental satisfaction and early return of the child with their family to the community.", "prediction_text": "The implementation of short stay or 23-hour wards in both a large teaching hospital and an academic children's hospital resulted in increased hospital efficiency, shorter length of stay, and high patient satisfaction. There were no reported adverse events and estimated savings due to more efficient bed usage."}
{"answers": "Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery is a safe method of treatment in patients with Cushing's disease. Operative findings, radiological and histological findings, together with early postoperative serum cortisol and urine free cortisol estimates may identify failures in treatment. Alternative treatment might then be required for these patients. Because of the risk of late relapse, patients require life-long follow-up.", "prediction_text": "Factors such as the presence of a tumor identified at surgery, radiological and histological findings, and postoperative cortisol levels can help predict the outcome of transsphenoidal pituitary surgery in patients with Cushing's disease. Patients with a tumor identified at surgery and positive radiological and histological findings are more likely to achieve remission. Additionally, low postoperative cortisol levels can indicate a higher likelihood of treatment success. However, some patients may still require hormonal replacement therapy or a second operation despite achieving long-term remission."}
{"answers": "Patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms have a great diversity of functional somatic symptoms. They use more somatic and psychotropic drugs than controls in the years before diagnosis. Moreover, they show high rates of referrals and psychiatric morbidity. The diversity of symptoms of patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms supports the concept that symptoms do not cluster in well defined distinct syndromes. Therefore, patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms should preferably not be classified into medical subspecialty syndromes.", "prediction_text": "Chronic functional somatic symptoms are associated with increased healthcare utilization, higher comorbidity, and greater psychiatric morbidity compared to controls, suggesting that they may represent a complex and heterogeneous condition rather than a single syndrome."}
{"answers": "The vast majority of MDT decisions are implemented. Management alteration was most often due to patient choice or additional information available after the MDT. A minority of management alterations were 'unjustifiable' and the authors recommend that any patient whose treatment is subsequently changed should have MDT rediscussion prior to treatment.", "prediction_text": "In the majority of cases, breast cancer patients received the treatment recommended by the multidisciplinary team (91.5%). However, there were some instances of discordance (4.5%), with most of these being justifiable due to additional information or patient choice."}
{"answers": "We found that 1.6% of S. aureus (all MSSA) from bacteraemic patients were PVL-positive. This low incidence suggests that PVL-positive S. aureus are of no particular significance as causative agents of S. aureus bacteraemia.", "prediction_text": "Out of 244 S. aureus bacteraemia isolates in the UK and Ireland during 2005, only 1.6% were PVL-positive and susceptible to oxacillin. These isolates were associated with infection foci of skin and soft tissue, unknown, indwelling line, and surgical site. The patients were located in one center in Wales, one in England, and two in Ireland. The isolates represented three distinct strains, with two being related. The significance of PVL in the pathogenesis of primary bacteraemia caused by S. aureus in the UK remains uncertain as only a small percentage of isolates were P"}
{"answers": "These findings are in accordance with previous experimental work and provide additional support for the assertion that dogs can prime autistic children for therapy. Ultimately, this study may contribute toward a change for full acceptance of canine-assisted therapy programs within the medical milieu. Additional studies using a similar research protocol on more autistic children will certainly help professionals to work on the most effective methods to individually serve this population through canine-assisted interventions.", "prediction_text": "The presence of a therapy dog during structured activities can enhance positive behaviors and reduce negative behaviors in children with autism spectrum disorder, suggesting that dogs may prime them for therapy."}
{"answers": "We conclude that increased cardiovascular risk of the DD genotype is not mediated through insulin resistance or abnormalities in fibrinolysis. Conversely, we report an increased sensitivity in NIDDM subjects with the ACE DD genotype.", "prediction_text": "The deletion allele of the ACE gene is associated with insulin resistance in non-insulin-dependent diabetic subjects. The insertion allele does not appear to be a candidate gene for insulin resistance in nondiabetic individuals."}
{"answers": "A history of PIPE may be a risk factor for the development of IPE. Yet, the disappearance of significance on multivariate analysis indicates that it is not an independent predictor.", "prediction_text": "The presence of postictal psychotic episodes (PIPE) may increase the risk of developing interictal psychotic episodes (IPE) in adults with partial seizure disorder, but other factors such as male gender and having bilateral ictal foci may also play a role. However, the predictive value of PIPE for IPE was not significant in multivariate analysis."}
{"answers": "QTcD is significantly increased in hypertensive patients with LVH compared with those without, being strongly correlated with the indices of LVH. A QTcD cut-off value of 60 ms predicted LVH in hypertensive patients with a high sensitivity and specificity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, corrected QT dispersion (QTcD) can predict left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in hypertensive patients with a sensitivity of 92.9% and specificity of 98.2%, using a cut-off value of 60 ms."}
{"answers": "The shaving of the incision site immediately before spinal surgery may increase the rate of postoperative infection.", "prediction_text": "Based on the given study, shaving the incision site before spinal surgery may increase the infection rate. However, it is important to note that this is just one study and more research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "The majority of EMS professionals thought that they should participate in disease and injury prevention programs. The respondents were mixed as to whether prevention services should be provided while on emergency calls, but those with experience providing these services were more likely to agree with providing them during emergency calls.", "prediction_text": "The majority (82.7%) of EMS professionals surveyed believe that EMS professionals should participate in disease prevention. However, only about a third (33.8%) of the respondents reported having provided prevention services. Those with certain demographic characteristics, such as a graduate degree, long-term EMS experience, military employment, working long hours, or responding to zero emergency calls in a typical week, were more likely to have provided prevention services. Additionally, EMS professionals who had participated in prevention programs were more likely to believe that EMS professionals should participate in prevention."}
{"answers": "Current K/DOQI guidelines are inadequate for correcting VDDI or secondary hyperparathyroidism in CKD patients. Future studies should examine the effects of higher or more frequent dosing of ergocalciferol on these clinical endpoints.", "prediction_text": "The results of this study suggest that the current K/DOQI recommended doses of ergocalciferol may not be adequate for correcting vitamin D deficiency and hyperparathyroidism in all CKD patients. While there was an increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, only a minority of patients achieved the target level of 30 ng/ml (75 nmol/l). Additionally, only a small percentage of patients had significant reductions in iPTH levels."}
{"answers": "Baseline pain intensity does not predict the outcome after an appropriate opioid titration. It is likely that non-homogeneous pain treatment would have biased the outcome of a previous work.", "prediction_text": "Contrary to the expectation, there was no correlation found between pain intensity at admission and poor opioid response in cancer patients. However, patients with poor opioid response had higher values of OEImg (opioid consumption index)."}
{"answers": "Maintaining viral load suppression over time in resource-limited-settings is feasible.", "prediction_text": "In this retrospective study of HIV-infected patients in a resource-limited setting, the majority (87.3%) were able to maintain viral load suppression on HAART for a median duration of 14 years. However, a significant number (16.5%) required third-line ART regimens due to virologic failures. The study suggests that while maintaining viral load suppression is feasible in resource-limited settings, the risk of virologic failure and the need for third-line drugs remains a concern."}
{"answers": "Mucosal redundancy is a constant associated finding in IHPS. Although the origin of the redundancy and a cause-and-effect relationship are difficult to establish, our findings support the hypothesis that hypergastrinemia may be implicated in the pathogenesis of IHPS, and suggest that mucosal thickening could be implicated as one of the initiating factors in its development.", "prediction_text": "The study provides evidence of pyloric mucosal redundancy and hypertrophy in infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, suggesting a possible role in the development of the condition. However, the cause of this mucosal hypertrophy remains unclear."}
{"answers": "Given the available screening technologies, discordant TEOAE and AABR may be inevitable for some categories of hearing loss among apparently healthy newborns whose mothers received prenatal care. The potential limitations of perinatal morbidities as basis of targeted screening for such cases therefore merit further consideration.", "prediction_text": "Discordant outcomes between transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) and automated auditory brainstem response (AABR) in newborns can be predicted by antenatal care status, mode of delivery, and nursery type. Infants with false-positive results were more likely to be admitted to the well-baby nursery, born to mothers who attended antenatal care, or delivered vaginally. Infants with true-positive results were more likely to be delivered vaginally and have severe hyperbilirubinemia. The predictive ability of these factors was moderate (c-statistic=0.73)."}
{"answers": "GM of CRC and SLM was associated with fewer procedures but did not influence overall survival. SM was associated with a longer delay and increased use of chemotherapy between procedures, suggesting that more rigorous selection of SM patients for surgery may explain the higher disease-free survival after SLM resection.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that global management of colorectal cancer with synchronous liver metastases at the same center may result in a lower number of procedures, shorter median delay between procedures, and higher disease-free survival to 5 years compared to separate management. However, there was no significant difference in three-month mortality or overall survival rates at 3 and 5 years between the two groups."}
{"answers": "epiDWI has the potential to differentiate pleomorphic adenoma and myoepithelial adenomas from all other examined entities. Due to an overlap not only within the group of benign and malignant lesions but also between groups, diagnoses should not be addressed on the basis of ADC values solely. Therefore, further studies combining DWI, morphologic criteria, and probably other MR imaging techniques seem warranted.", "prediction_text": "Echo-planar diffusion-weighted MR imaging can help differentiate some types of primary parotid gland tumors, specifically pleomorphic adenomas from other entities like myoepithelial adenomas, Warthin tumors, lipomas, and salivary duct carcinomas. However, it cannot distinguish Warthin tumors from mucoepidermoid carcinomas, acinic cell carcinomas, and basal cell adenocarcinomas."}
{"answers": "The survey shows significant dissatisfaction amongst consultant radiologists with the current service, confirms a low number of paediatric radiologists taking on this work, and suggests the potential to increase numbers of radiology child abuse experts by 27% if given improved training and support. Appropriate service and education strategies should be implemented.", "prediction_text": "The survey suggests that there is a significant proportion of UK radiology departments where initial reports on skeletal surveys for suspected child abuse are not provided by paediatric radiologists, and many radiologists feel that the service could be improved. Additionally, only a small percentage of radiologists are willing to provide expert evidence."}
{"answers": "The enhancement of serum TNFalpha and IL-6 levels in the patients with ERCP-induced pancreatitis reflects the inflammatory activity. Additionally, these cytokines together with IL-4 can be used in clinical laboratory monitoring of ERCP.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that changes in the serum levels of IL-2, IL-4, TNFalpha, and IL-6 can reflect the inflammatory activity in the development of post-ERCP pancreatitis, with significantly lower IL-4 levels and higher TNFalpha levels and TNFalpha/IL-4 ratios, as well as increased IL-6 levels in the complicated group."}
{"answers": "During the 5 years, 24% of Africans with optimal BP developed hypertension. The surge in hypertension in Africa is largely explained by modifiable risk factors. Public health strategies should focus aggressively on lifestyle to prevent a catastrophic burden on the national health system.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that smoking, greater waist circumference, and higher levels of \u03b3-glutamyltransferase are associated with the conversion from optimal blood pressure to hypertensive status in Black South Africans. Alcohol intake also predicts changes in central systolic BP and carotid cross-sectional wall area. HIV infection, on the other hand, is inversely associated with increased BP."}
{"answers": "Our data have revealed a number of differences. Compared to the clinic sample, the Web-based sample had worse psychological symptom burden, younger average age, higher prevalence of employment, and a lower proportion on ART. For future research, we recommend that Web-based data collection should include the demographic variables that we note differed between samples. In addition, we recognize that each recruitment method may bring inherent sampling bias, with clinic populations differing by geographical location and reflecting those accessing regular medical care, and Web-based sampling recruiting those with greater Internet access and identifying survey materials through specific searches and contact with specific websites.", "prediction_text": "The Web-based sample of gay men living with HIV reported higher psychological symptom burden compared to the clinic sample, but there was no significant difference in physical symptom burden between the two groups. Employment status was a significant predictor of both physical and psychological symptom burden, with those in employment less likely to report high symptom scores."}
{"answers": "The majority of acetabular components in this cohort were stable despite the small contact surface achieved between the component and pelvic bone. Three of 10 migrated in excess of the limits that predict later loosening in primary THA but it remains to be seen whether these limits apply to this selected group of frail osteoporotic patients. We continue to use this technique routinely to treat patients with the same indications, but since the analysis of these data we have added screw fixation of the acetabular component to the ischial tuberosity and the superior pubic ramus.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups can provide initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures, but some components showed migration above the suggested limits for primary THA at 1 year postoperatively. The contact surface achieved between the acetabular component and pelvis was variable."}
{"answers": "Despite high perioperative mortality, results document a sustainable recovery of the survivors offering the prospect of a highly independent and satisfying life. Therefore, advanced age alone should not be a contraindication for redo cardiac interventions. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2016; 16: 1138-1144.", "prediction_text": "In this study, the functional status and quality of life of octogenarian patients who underwent cardiac reoperations were assessed using the Barthel Index, New York Heart Association class, and short form-12 questionnaire. The results showed that while the mortality rate was high both in-hospital and during follow-up, survivors had good functional status and quality of life comparable to age- and sex-matched normative population. However, the decision to perform a cardiac reoperation in octogenarians should be individualized based on the specific clinical situation."}
{"answers": "Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (ie, SMI) were more likely than other patients to be admitted to nursing homes with higher deficiency citations for both overall quality and clinical care quality. Further research is necessary to understand the reasons behind the disparity in quality of nursing home care associated with SMI.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patients with serious mental illness, specifically those with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, are more likely to be admitted to nursing homes with more deficiencies in care compared to other patients."}
{"answers": "Patients undergoing open access procedures are less likely to be properly informed about their endoscopic procedure. Our results indicate that with open access endoscopy, a defined mechanism needs to be in place for communication of endoscopic results to the patient.", "prediction_text": "Open access endoscopy may result in less comprehensive preprocedural information and explanation for patients compared to those referred from a gastrointestinal subspecialty clinic. This could potentially impact patient satisfaction and understanding of the procedure results."}
{"answers": "Contrary to common belief, we found that uterine myomas commonly decrease in volume over the course of pregnancy.", "prediction_text": "Uterine myomas can exhibit variable growth patterns during pregnancy, with some decreasing in size, others remaining stable, and some increasing significantly. The study reports that during the first half to third quarter of pregnancy, about half of the myomas decreased in size, while the other half enlarged. In the third quarter to term period, most myomas decreased in size, but some still enlarged."}
{"answers": "We found that all of the studied dimensions of restricted fetal growth are independently associated with increased risks of low intellectual performance and that these associations are only partly mediated by socioeconomic or familial factors.", "prediction_text": "The increased risk of low intellectual performance in early adulthood associated with being born light, short, or with a small head circumference for gestational age is not completely explained by socioeconomic factors or familial effects, as the association was observed both within and between families."}
{"answers": "Although feasible, double reading of barium enemas does not improve sensitivity for detection of polyps and produces a higher false-positive rate.", "prediction_text": "Double reading of barium enemas can increase the number of detected lesions and potentially alter clinical treatment, but it may decrease specificity and overall agreement, and requires additional time. The decision to implement double reading should consider the potential benefits and costs."}
{"answers": "The VMPA can provide direct access and favorable visibility to the TMJ region and yield good esthetic and functional results. The VMPA can be considered the approach of choice for common TMJ surgeries.", "prediction_text": "The vascular-guided multilayer preauricular approach (VMPA) to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) can improve access and potentially reduce complications based on this clinical study of 606 joints, which reported successful surgeries, favorable incision healing, and no permanent facial nerve weakness or severe complications."}
{"answers": "The metastasis rate of station 9 lymph nodes was significantly lower than other mediastinal stations in lung cancer patients. The metastasis status of station 9 had no significant influence on tumor staging or prognosis. Routine dissection of station 9 lymph nodes may not be necessary, especially in patients with a low T stage, upper or middle lobe tumors, or without intrapulmonary lymph node metastasis.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, the routine dissection of station 9 lymph nodes during primary lung cancer surgery may not be necessary, as the metastasis rate is low and the staging results and patient survival are not significantly impacted. However, the decision to dissect station 9 nodes should still consider individual patient factors such as pT stage, tumor location, and intrapulmonary lymph node metastasis status."}
{"answers": "During the time period considered, the FDA AED-related suicidality warning does not appear to have significantly affected prescription claims of AED medications for the study population.", "prediction_text": "No significant change in trend of antiepileptic drug prescription claims was detected after the FDA suicidality warning."}
{"answers": "In our population of stroke survivors, self-reports of motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions differed from government records. In future studies, the use of both government and self-reported data would ensure a more accurate picture of driving safety post-stroke.", "prediction_text": "There is moderate agreement between Department of Transportation records and self-reports of motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions in stroke survivors, but up to 56% more accidents and up to 46% more convictions may be identified when both sources of data are consulted."}
{"answers": "The realized communication skills courses resulted in relevant changes in communication behaviour and self-confidence of participants. Communication with terminally ill patients can be taught.", "prediction_text": "Yes, effective communication skills for interacting with terminally ill patients can be taught through structured courses, as evidenced by improvements in participants' self-reported sense of security and communication behavior."}
{"answers": "For conditions with a well-developed quality of care evidence base, such as hypertension and diabetes, a single structured implicit review to assess the quality of care over a period of time is moderately reliable. This method could be a reasonable complement or alternative to explicit indicator approaches for assessing and comparing quality of care. Structured implicit review, like explicit quality measures, must be used more cautiously for illnesses for which the evidence base is less well developed, such as COPD and acute, short-course illnesses.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that peer review using a structured implicit chart review instrument can have low reliability for assessing the quality of care for certain conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and a collection of acute conditions. However, for conditions with a well-developed evidence base, such as diabetes and hypertension, the reliability of peer review is higher. The higher reliability is due to the reviewers' ability to distinguish more differences in the quality of care between patients rather than less random noise or individual reviewer bias."}
{"answers": "The high rate of unsuccessful IUD insertions reported here, particularly for nulliparous women, suggests that the true insertion failure rate of providers who are not employing additional tools for difficult insertions may be much higher than reported in clinical trials. Further investigation is necessary to determine if this is a common problem and, if so, to assess if the use of adjuvant measures will reduce the number of unsuccessful IUD insertions.", "prediction_text": "The study found that 19.6% of IUD insertions in nulliparous women and 13.6% in parous women were unsuccessful during emergency contraception at community family planning clinics. The adjusted odds ratio suggested a higher risk of failure in nulliparous women, although the result was not statistically significant. These findings highlight the importance of addressing the challenges of IUD insertion in community practice."}
{"answers": "Even in capped health care systems, virtual planning and guided surgery including prebent or milled plates are financially viable.", "prediction_text": "In capped payment systems, the use of virtual planning and guided surgery for mandibular reconstruction with fibular free flaps can result in significant time savings during surgery, which can offset the additional cost of planning and guide production for both prebent and milled plates."}
{"answers": "Bipolarity does not independently influence risk of suicidal behavior or alter the influence of well-established suicide risk factors within affective disorders. Suicide risk assessment strategies may continue to appraise these common risk factors without regard to mood polarity.", "prediction_text": "The study found that age, hopelessness, and active substance abuse were risk factors for suicidal behavior in both major depressive and bipolar disorders, and there were no significant differences in the effects of these risk factors by polarity."}
{"answers": "The administration of polyvalent Crotalidae antivenin is safe. Acute hypersensitivity, when it occurs, consists solely in most cases of urticaria. Serious side effects are uncommon.", "prediction_text": "The study found that acute side effects from the use of polyvalent antivenin for rattlesnake bites occurred in 18% of patients, with urticaria being the most common reaction. No deaths, amputations, or permanent disabilities were reported."}
{"answers": "Although endomyocardial fibrosis patients have improved clinical symptoms after surgery, the global left ventricular ejection fraction and regional wall motion in these patients do not change. This finding suggests that other explanations, such as improvements in diastolic function, may be operational.", "prediction_text": "In this study, there was no significant change in quantitative left ventricular regional wall motion after fibrous tissue resection in endomyocardial fibrosis patients. However, there was an improvement in New York Heart Association functional class in the majority of patients."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrates that laser pretreatment significantly increases absorption of topical lidocaine so that it is detectable in the blood and that manipulating laser settings can affect drug absorption. Future work will look at translating this effect into clinical benefit.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study demonstrates that fractional lasers can enhance transdermal absorption of topical lidocaine in an in vivo animal model, as evidenced by increased serum levels of lidocaine and its metabolite MEGX following laser treatment. The study also suggests that the laser settings can influence the extent of absorption enhancement."}
{"answers": "Vaccines were exposed to temperatures that may reduce their potency. Safe storage of vaccines in the clinics cannot be ensured without adhering to the recommended guidelines. Provision of adequate equipment and training for staff in maintaining the \"cold chain\" and the use and care of equipment are important components of a successful immunisation programme.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the storage of vaccines in the community can be a weak link in the cold chain based on the findings of this study, with many healthcare facilities not adhering to appropriate storage conditions and inconsistent temperature monitoring."}
{"answers": "p53 alteration detected by IHC or SSCP analysis is not a clinically useful predictor of local response to pre-operative adjuvant therapy in advanced rectal carcinoma.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the presence of p53 alterations (either protein accumulation or gene mutation) may be associated with a greater reduction in tumour size following pre-operative chemo-radiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer. However, the data does not provide conclusive evidence to definitively use p53 alterations as a reliable predictor of tumour response. Further research with larger sample sizes and more robust statistical analysis is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "The results of this study cast doubt on the suggested advantage of HBO in reducing patient mortality and morbidity when used as adjuvant therapy for NF.", "prediction_text": "The use of hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) as adjuvant therapy for necrotizing fasciitis (NF) remains controversial. While some studies suggest improved patient mortality and outcome, the evidence is not conclusive. The retrospective study in question did not find a significant difference in mortality rate or average length of hospitalization between patients who received HBO and those who did not. However, the HBO group required more surgical d\u00e9bridements on average. Further research is needed to determine the role of HBO in the treatment of NF."}
{"answers": "High doses of ZNS are effective and safe in pharmacoresistant epileptic patients. Therapeutic drug monitoring of ZNS may be considered at therapeutic failure.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that high doses of zonisamide (>500 mg/d) can be effective and tolerated by some adult European patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy. However, the sample size was small and more research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "In conclusion, high Ki-67 expression was associated with poor survival in patients with UTUC, as well as a high risk of disease progression, although these findings need to be interpreted with caution. Large-scale, adequately designed, prospective trials are needed to further confirm the value of Ki-67 in prognosis of UTUC patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, overexpression of Ki-67 is a significant prognostic biomarker of poor cancer-specific survival, disease-free survival, and disease progression in patients with upper tract urinary carcinoma."}
{"answers": "After comparing MR with arthroscopic findings and reviewing the available literature, we conclude that arthroscopy permits the direct visualization of even fine articular surface changes but does not depict the subchondral bone, the most frequent site of injury detected with MRI. MRI was a very useful tool in the detection and characterization of the different types of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries and showed a statistically significant correlation between site and distribution of bone and cartilage injuries and between internal damage and trauma mechanisms. Therefore, we believe that MRI can help avoid diagnostic arthroscopy in the patients with a history of post-traumatic pain, acute articular blocks and negative radiographic findings.", "prediction_text": "MRI can detect and characterize a significant number of occult bone and cartilage injuries in the knee that may be missed on conventional radiography. However, it may not completely replace diagnostic arthroscopy as some injuries may have similar MR signal intensity patterns but differ in clinical significance."}
{"answers": "The prevalence of cognitive impairment in MND in this population based study of an unselected cohort was higher than has been previously reported. Language deficits, especially anomia, may be relatively frequent in the MND population. Aphasia in MND may be masked by dysarthria and missed if not specifically examined.", "prediction_text": "Approximately one-third of patients with motor neuron disease present with both cognitive dysfunction and language deficits, including dementia and aphasia."}
{"answers": "Postoperative numbness occurs in most patients receiving nasal microfat injections. Partial to complete recovery of nasal tip sensation can be expected to occur over a 3-month period.", "prediction_text": "The sensation in the nasal tip gradually returns after microfat grafting, with significant improvement observed up to 12 weeks post-procedure. However, some numbness may persist initially."}
{"answers": "Conveyance of emotions or movements through music may be decoded differently by persons with different types of communication disorders. Because music is the primary therapeutic tool in music therapy sessions, clinicians should consider these differential abilities when selecting music for clinical interventions focusing on emotions or movement.", "prediction_text": "Communication disorders, such as severe to profound hearing loss and autism spectrum disorder, can impact the ability to recognize symbolic representation of emotions and movements in music. While there was no significant difference in identification of musical emotions or movements between children with autism spectrum disorder and those with typical development and normal hearing, children with hearing loss using cochlear implants showed significantly lower accuracy. The pattern of accuracy for specific emotions varied between groups."}
{"answers": "For some patients, using colour to describe their pain experience may be a useful tool to improve doctor-patient communication.", "prediction_text": "The use of color to describe Osteoarthritis pain is generally acceptable to patients, with red commonly used for high-intensity pain due to its association with inflammation and intensity. However, the interpretability and standardization of color as a means of communicating pain to healthcare professionals remains a concern."}
{"answers": "It appears safe to administer intensive chemotherapy regimens at standard doses to rural patients without increased morbidity or mortality. Support for general practitioners through phone or videoconferencing may reduce the safety concerns.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that intensive chemotherapy regimens can be safely administered to rural patients with node-positive breast and metastatic colorectal cancers at the same doses as urban patients, based on the similar rates of serious adverse events and dose intensities between the two groups. However, it is important to note that the sample size was relatively small and further research may be needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Although outcomes for EPSCC remains poor, both surgery and radiation is shown to significantly improve median, 5- and 10-year survival rates. EPSCC patients who are potential candidates for surgical resection or radiation therapy may benefit from these treatments.", "prediction_text": "Surgical extirpation and radiation therapy can improve survival for patients with extrapulmonary small cell carcinomas, particularly for those with gastrointestinal disease. Factors such as age, gender, stage, radiation, and surgery have been identified as independent predictors of survival."}
{"answers": "DGE after PPPD seems to be of minor clinical importance following uncomplicated surgery. When taking the results into consideration, it can be said that, despite the lack of a control group, antecolic duodenojejunostomy might be the key to a low incidence of DGE after PPPD. In our experience, DGE is linked to the occurrence of other postoperative complications rather than to pylorus preservation.", "prediction_text": "Modifying the anatomy of the duodenojejunostomy from retrocolic to antecolic during pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy may reduce the incidence of delayed gastric emptying. However, the study suggests that the presence of other postoperative complications may increase the risk of delayed gastric emptying."}
{"answers": "In women with POP, the symptom of pelvic pain is associated with the presence of defecatory symptoms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, pelvic pain is significantly associated with defecatory symptoms in women with pelvic organ prolapse. Specifically, women with pelvic pain are more likely to experience straining with bowel movement, sense of incomplete emptying, pain with bowel movement, and splinting with bowel movement."}
{"answers": "The results confirm that c-kit is vastly expressed in uveal melanoma, suggest that the c-kit molecular pathway may be important in uveal melanoma growth, and point to its use as a target for therapy with STI571.", "prediction_text": "The expression and activation of c-kit in uveal melanoma cells suggest that it plays a role in their growth and survival. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 effectively blocks c-kit phosphorylation and induces cell death in uveal melanoma cell lines, making c-kit a potential therapeutic target."}
{"answers": "Results suggest that telmisartan may reduce type-I diabetes mellitus-induced hepatic injury by suppressing activated hepatic stellate cells through concomitant TGF-beta1 down-regulation.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that telmisartan may have a protective effect against hepatic fibrosis in rats with alloxan-induced diabetes, as indicated by a decrease in TGF-beta immunoreactivity. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "The great majority of U.S. renal transplant centers will not transplant kidneys to HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease, even if their infection is asymptomatic. However, advances in the management of HIV infection and a review of relevant ethical issues suggest that this approach should be reconsidered.", "prediction_text": "The current practice among U.S. transplant centers is to exclude asymptomatic HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease from transplantation due to concerns about harm to the individual and the perceived waste of precious organs. However, recent advances in HIV management and prognosis suggest that this policy should be reevaluated."}
{"answers": "The overall yield of SL for HCC was 7 %, and the accuracy was 27 %. When accurate imaging methods are available and additional percutaneous liver biopsy is implemented as a standard procedure in the preoperative workup of patients with HCC, the benefit of SL will become even less.", "prediction_text": "Staging laparoscopy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma can be useful as it may prevent unnecessary open explorations and allow for assessment of fibrosis/cirrhosis. However, the yield and accuracy of this procedure are relatively low, with approximately 7% detection of unresectable disease and 17% changes in management due to cirrhosis."}
{"answers": "Expert breast pathology assessments continue to be necessary in the management of DCIS.", "prediction_text": "Yes, expert breast pathology assessment is necessary for the accurate assessment and management of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), as it can lead to significant changes in risk assessment and treatment. The study showed that secondary pathology assessments led to changes in local recurrence risk in nearly 30% of cases and contributed to changes in treatment recommendations in over 40% of cases."}
{"answers": "Vaginal pH should be measured by bringing the pH strip in direct contact with fresh vaginal fluid without first adding saline.", "prediction_text": "Vaginal pH measurement from wet mount microscopy slides is not an accurate method due to systematic increases in pH after the addition of saline, leading to potential false positive readings."}
{"answers": "This study presents a different clinical picture of oral mucoceles/ranulas, as observed in HIV-positive patients. Additionally, it suggests a possible clinical link between the two pathologies. The authors strongly support the suggestion that oral mucocele/ranula is an HIV-related salivary gland disease.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that HIV-positive patients have a higher risk (P<0.001) of developing both simple and plunging ranulas compared to HIV-negative patients."}
{"answers": "There are no data to support the widespread practice of using central venous pressure to guide fluid therapy. This approach to fluid resuscitation should be abandoned.", "prediction_text": "The central venous pressure does not reliably predict fluid responsiveness, as indicated by a summary area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.56 (95% CI, 0.54-0.58) with no significant heterogeneity between studies."}
{"answers": "Increased D-dimer levels should not be considered as a diagnostic parameter in diagnosis of acute appendicitis.", "prediction_text": "The results of this study did not show a statistically significant correlation between D-dimer levels and the presence or absence of acute appendicitis. Therefore, D-dimer cannot be considered a reliable diagnostic parameter for acute appendicitis based on the findings of this study."}
{"answers": "Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mitochondria play a role in the programmed cell death (PCD) process in the lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) by undergoing specific dynamics, including changes in distribution, motility, and membrane potential, which are associated with the progression of PCD. Additionally, mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) formation may be involved in this process."}
{"answers": "Our study emphasised the discomfort of transurethral urinary catheters, especially in male patients, and the high incidence of urinary tract infections in both sexes. Consideration should be given to the utilisation of alternative methods of bladder drainage, such as suprapubic catheterisation, which can be performed with ease during laparotomy.", "prediction_text": "Transurethral catheterisation is not the ideal method of bladder drainage due to its discomfort and increased risk of urinary tract infections, particularly in male patients."}
{"answers": "Based on this pilot data, MASCC score appears promising in determining suitability for outpatient management of NF in gynecologic oncology patients. Prospective study is ongoing to confirm safety and determine impact on cost.", "prediction_text": "Risk stratification using the MASCC index can help identify high-risk gynecologic oncology patients with neutropenic fever who may benefit from inpatient management due to a higher likelihood of severe complications and mortality."}
{"answers": "Halofantrine has mild to moderate pathological effects on cochlea histology, and can be considered an ototoxic drug.", "prediction_text": "Yes, halofantrine is ototoxic, causing damage to inner and outer hair cells and spiral ganglia cells in the cochlea at therapeutic and double therapeutic doses."}
{"answers": "Proportionally fewer elderly patients with OPSCC are being treated than younger individuals. These patients can have significant benefits from aggressive treatments despite their older age as shown by our survival analysis. We recommend the use of objective measures to assess patient fitness to reduce the potential for undertreatment in the elderly population.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that there is a significant increase in the number of elderly patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma who did not receive treatment after age 55. However, the study also showed that surgery, radiation, or combined therapy provided substantial benefits in disease-specific survival for age groups 65 to 74 and 75 to 84. Therefore, aggressive therapy should be considered for elderly patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma."}
{"answers": "Minimal access surgery for the repair of esophageal atresia or congenital diaphragmatic hernia is not associated with less cumulative opioid doses.", "prediction_text": "In this specific study, minimal access surgery in neonates with esophageal atresia or congenital diaphragmatic hernia did not result in less opioid consumption or lower pain scores compared to conventional surgery."}
{"answers": "Clinical predictors appear inadequate for the evaluation of the cervical spine in geriatric trauma patients with low-energy mechanism.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that clinical predictors may not be adequate in the identification of cervical spine fractures in geriatric blunt trauma patients with low-energy mechanism. Neck tenderness was the only predictor that showed a significant association with cervical spine injuries, but it was present in only about half of the cases."}
{"answers": "European individuals with type 1 diabetes consume a high atherogenic diet as few patients met recommendations for dietary fibre and saturated fat. This study showed minor changes in dietary nutrients and energy intakes over a period of 7 years. Nutrition education needs particular focus on strategies to increase dietary fibre and reduce saturated fat to exploit their potential benefit.", "prediction_text": "European individuals with type 1 diabetes do not consistently follow the current European nutritional recommendations for a healthy diet, particularly in regards to fiber and saturated fat intake, which are important factors in reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases."}
{"answers": "The gaps in patella eversion demonstrated smaller gaps both in knee extension and flexion position compared to the gaps of patella reduction position. The amount of decreased gaps was more definite in knee flexion position. Therefore, the intraoperative patellar positioning has influence on the measurement of the joint gap. Keeping the patella in reduced position is important during gap balancing.", "prediction_text": "Patella position, specifically eversion, can influence ligament balancing in total knee arthroplasty, leading to variable mediolateral gaps in knee flexion position compared to reduction position."}
{"answers": "We have thus provided compelling evidence that there is a mossy fiber GABAergic signal. The physiologic role of this mossy fiber GABAergic signal is uncertain, but may be of developmental importance. Other evidence suggests that this GABAergic signal is transiently upregulated after seizures. This could have an inhibitory or disinhibitory effect, and further work is needed to elucidate its actual role.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mossy fibers release GABA in addition to their primary excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate. This GABA release occurs at the mossy fiber-CA3 synapses in the hippocampus."}
{"answers": "Men and women in this community sample reported similar patterns of depressive symptoms. No evidence that the presentation of depressive symptoms differs by gender was found.", "prediction_text": "The study found no significant gender differences in the self-report of depression symptoms after adjusting for several potentially influential characteristics. Therefore, the higher rates of depression in women cannot be fully explained by differential symptom reporting."}
{"answers": "Time to primary treatment after a diagnosis of breast cancer had no impact on overall survival. Further studies on care before diagnosis are important in drawing up meaningful quality indicators.", "prediction_text": "In this study, no significant impact of time to primary treatment on breast cancer survival was observed. However, ethnicity and stage at presentation were associated with delayed treatment."}
{"answers": "Our findings reveal a significant decrease in ADMA levels of ex-ELBW subjects compared to C, underlining a probable correlation with preterm birth and low birth weight. Taken together, these results may underlie the onset of early circulatory dysfunction predictive of increased cardiovascular risk.", "prediction_text": "Yes, reduced ADMA levels in young adults born preterm at extremely low birth weight are significantly correlated with decreased gestational age and birth weight, suggesting a potential predictive role for early endothelial dysfunction."}
{"answers": "ECL assays improved the ability to predict time to diabetes in these autoantibody-positive relatives at risk for developing diabetes. These findings might be helpful in the design and eligibility criteria for prevention trials in the future.", "prediction_text": "Yes, electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assays can improve prediction of time to type 1 diabetes in autoantibody-positive TrialNet subjects. The addition of ECL to the Diabetes Prevention Trial risk score (DPTRS) enhances the receiver operating characteristic curves with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.83 (P<0.0001)."}
{"answers": "These findings indicate that a relationship between multiple sclerosis and streptococcal infections may exist, but to acquire a better understanding of the role of group A streptococci in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, more studies with animal models are necessary.", "prediction_text": "Elevated antideoxyribonuclease B levels in patients with multiple sclerosis suggest a possible association between past streptococcal infections and the disease. However, further research is needed to establish a definitive link."}
{"answers": "Aplastic anemia is associated with a variety of autoimmune syndromes. The sequence of events in our patient suggests that the hepatic failure, AFOP, and the VSAA may all have been part of an autoimmune syndrome. AFOP could be the result of immune dysregulation in this pediatric case with favorable outcome after immunosuppressive therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.", "prediction_text": "Acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP) may be associated with immune dysregulation, as evidenced by the reported case of a child with AFOP and very severe aplastic anemia (VSAA), whose condition improved only after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between AFOP and immune dysregulation."}
{"answers": "Rescue AC may apply to only 18% of cases, and we identified subsets of more likely candidates.", "prediction_text": "The opportunity for \"rescue\" antenatal corticosteroid administration depends on the reason for initial administration and gestational age at the time of administration. Women who received corticosteroids for premature preterm rupture of membranes, twins, or before 28 weeks had a higher likelihood of delivering prematurely within a week."}
{"answers": "The results show that fatigue in patients with pSS and sSS is not due to the coexistence of FM in most cases. A lower incidence in the United Kingdom of FM in patients with pSS was found than has been previously reported.", "prediction_text": "The prevalence of fatigue is higher in primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome patients compared to lupus patients, but the prevalence of fibromyalgia syndrome is lower in primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome patients than in lupus patients. The relationship between fatigue and fibromyalgia syndrome in primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome requires further investigation."}
{"answers": "UDR provides an objective measurement of VUR and appears as a predictive tool of success after endoscopic injection.", "prediction_text": "Distal ureteral diameter and uretero-pelvic ratio can be used as predictors of reflux resolution after endoscopic injection in children with primary vesicoureteral reflux."}
{"answers": ": Data from both association and expression studies suggested that variants at HINT1 may be associated with schizophrenia and the associations may be sex-specific. However, the markers showing associations were in high LD to the SPEC2/PDZ-GEF2/ACSL6 locus reported previously in the same samples. This made it difficult to separate the association signals amongst these genes. Other independent studies may be necessary to distinguish these candidate genes.", "prediction_text": "The HINT1 gene, located on chromosome 5q31.2, has been implicated in linkage studies of schizophrenia and is associated with dysregulation of postsynaptic dopamine transmission. This study found nominally significant differences in allele frequencies of several SNPs around the HINT1 gene in schizophrenia patients compared to controls in two separate samples. However, the sex effect differed between the samples and no significant difference in expression was observed between patients and controls. Significant interactions amongst sex, diagnosis, and rs3864283 genotypes were observed. These findings suggest that the HINT1 gene may be a candidate for schizophren"}
{"answers": "Out of the four sacral sparing criteria, the acute phase anal sensory score measurements do not contribute significantly to the prognosis of independent ambulation. The combination of the acute phase voluntary anal contraction and the S4-5 LT and PP scores, predicts significantly better chronic phase-independent ambulation outcomes than the currently used distinction between complete and incomplete SCI.", "prediction_text": "The determination between complete and incomplete traumatic spinal cord injury based on traditional methods has limited discriminatory value for predicting independent ambulation 1-year post injury. The use of sacral sparing measurements, specifically S4-5 light touch and pin prick sensory scores, in combination with voluntary anal contraction, can provide better predictive accuracy."}
{"answers": "These findings suggest that schizophrenia is associated with progressive structural brain abnormalities, affecting both gray and white matter. We found no evidence to suggest progressive medial temporal lobe involvement but did find evidence that this may be partly explained by heterogeneity between studies in patient age and illness duration. The causes and clinical correlates of these progressive brain changes should now be the focus of investigation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the findings from this systematic review suggest that there are progressive brain changes in schizophrenia, with significant decreases in whole brain volume, gray matter, and specific white matter regions, as well as increases in lateral ventricular volume over time."}
{"answers": "The elevated risk of death after CABG surgery known previously to be associated with CDM seems also to be shared by a group of similar size that includes patients with IFG and undiagnosed DM.", "prediction_text": "Impaired fasting blood glucose levels are associated with an increased risk of mortality after coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. The risk is lower than for patients with clinical diabetes mellitus but still significant. The area under the curve for the continuous variable of fasting blood glucose and 1-year mortality is 0.65."}
{"answers": "This is the first known report of concurrent plasma and ISF concentrations of a meropenem antibiotic during CVVHDF. We observed that the ISF concentrations of meropenem were significantly lower than the plasma concentrations, although the present dose was appropriate for infections caused by intermediately susceptible pathogens (MIC\u22644 mg/L).", "prediction_text": "Interstitial fluid meropenem concentrations are lower than plasma concentrations in critically ill patients receiving continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration, with an estimated penetration of approximately 60-70%."}
{"answers": "Despite advances in early diagnosis and surgical technique, 5-year survival of stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma remains low as compared to survival of other solid organ neoplasm. Tumour size<or=3cm, adenocarcinoma histologic type and negative bronchial resection margins were associated with a more favourable outcome in our patient population. More effective multimodality treatments are needed to increase survival rates.", "prediction_text": "Five-year survival for Stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma is 63%, with significant prognostic factors being histology (adenocarccinoma having better prognosis), tumor size (smaller tumors having better prognosis), and negative resection margin."}
{"answers": "There is a knowledge deficit regarding the SU treatment goal among gout patients receiving ULT, despite generally high levels of other gout-specific knowledge. SU goal information may be an important and underutilized concept among providers treating gout patients.", "prediction_text": "Only 14% of gout patients in this study were aware of their serum urate (SU) goal, and having a rheumatologist as the initial prescriber and having correct answers for all other gout-specific knowledge questions were associated with greater odds of knowing the SU goal. However, SU goal knowledge was only associated with self-reported global health status, but not with self-reported health-related quality of life or gout-specific health status."}
{"answers": "Despite government assistance, low-income individuals use vision care services less often than wealthy individuals.", "prediction_text": "The study found that among middle-aged white individuals without specific eye conditions, those with financial difficulty had lower utilization of eye care providers (prevalence ratio 0.68, 95% CI 0.57-0.80) compared to those without financial difficulty. However, the study did not directly assess the impact of government assistance on utilization, as it only compared utilization rates between those with and without financial difficulty. The study did suggest that in some provinces, insufficient government assistance for eye examinations and eyeglasses may be a barrier to care for low-income individuals."}
{"answers": "Premature births from rural mothers have a higher risk of stillbirth and mortality in neonatal intensive care than urban infants.", "prediction_text": "Yes, infants born to mothers residing in rural areas have poorer neonatal outcomes, including higher mortality, compared to those born to mothers residing in urban areas in the case of very premature infants."}
{"answers": "Altered ET-1 levels may be involved in the pathogenesis of rebound hypertension and hypotension during HD.", "prediction_text": "Endothelin-1 may play a role in the development of both hypotension and rebound hypertension during hemodialysis. The study found that ET-1 levels decreased in patients with dialysis-induced hypotension and increased in those with rebound hypertension compared to stable patients."}
{"answers": "While FS was commonly used in patients undergoing thyroidectomy at our institution, in no patient over the last decade did FS correctly alter the intraoperative management. Given the time required to perform FS and the cost associated with it, we believe that routine FS should not be performed in these patients.", "prediction_text": "Frozen section analysis during thyroidectomy for multinodular thyroid disease does not alter the intraoperative management. Its sensitivity for the diagnosis of thyroid cancer is low."}
{"answers": "Elderly patients have informational and relational needs similar to those of younger patients. In fact, most of the whole sample flagged up the need for higher levels of satisfaction especially concerning a better dialogue with health staff, along with a new factor: the need to talk to people with the same illness.", "prediction_text": "Yes, elderly cancer patients have different care needs compared to younger ones, with a higher prevalence of requests for financial-insurance information, the need to talk to people with the same illness, and the need for more comprehensible information from healthcare professionals. Additionally, older patients expressed a greater need for a better dialogue with clinicians."}
{"answers": "According to the results of our study and the data from the international literature, the entity globulomaxillary cyst is no longer justified.", "prediction_text": "The so-called \"globulomaxillary cysts\" are no longer considered as a distinct entity. Instead, various pathological processes, such as lateral periodontal cysts, radicular cysts, keratocystic odontogenic tumors, adenomatoid odontogenic tumors, periapical granulomas, residual cysts, and undefined jaw cysts, can occur in the region previously associated with globulomaxillary cysts."}
{"answers": "Although components of the CSM (cognitive and emotional representations, coping strategies) were associated with fears of recurrence, optimism was found to be the strongest predictor of fear, independent of anxiety and level of fear reported prior to treatment.", "prediction_text": "Pre-treatment fears of recurrence and optimism are predictive of long-term fears of recurrence in head and neck cancer survivors."}
{"answers": "Older adults enrolled in PICT with more symptoms may sacrifice QOL for experimental treatment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the presence of multiple symptoms in older adults with advanced cancer undergoing phase I clinical trials is associated with increased admissions, complications, and functional decline."}
{"answers": "Effective CPAP treatment in IPF patients with OSA results in a significant improvement in daily living activities based on the FOSQ, namely an OSA-specific follow-up instrument. Improvement was also noted in other questionnaires assessing quality of life, though not to a statistically significant degree, probably because of the multifactorial influences of IPF on physical and mental health. The probability of poor CPAP compliance was high and could only be eliminated with intense follow-up by the CPAP clinic staff.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that CPAP therapy can improve functional outcomes in sleep quality in IPF patients with obstructive sleep apnea, as indicated by a statistically significant improvement in the Functional Outcomes in Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ) scores at 1, 3, and 6 months after CPAP initiation. However, not all patients were able to comply with CPAP therapy due to reasons such as nocturnal cough and claustrophobia. Heated humidification was added to improve compliance. The study also reports improvement trends in other quality of life parameters, but the improvements were not statistically significant."}
{"answers": "Income support policy may be a significant new lever for improving population health, especially that of lower-income persons. Even though the findings are robust, further analyses are needed to confirm their reliability. Future research should examine a variety of different income support policies, as well as whether a broader range of social and economic policies affect health.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program has a positive effect on reducing disability in the elderly population. An increase in maximum SSI benefits is associated with a decrease in disability rates, particularly for mobility limitations."}
{"answers": "None of the clinical identifiers for early-stage adhesive capsulitis previously proposed by expert consensus have been validated in this study. Clinicians should be aware that commonly used clinical identifiers may not be applicable to this stage.", "prediction_text": "The study identified pain at the end of range of all measured active movements as a potential clinical identifier for early-stage primary/idiopathic adhesive capsulitis, but the lack of a recognized reference standard for diagnosing this condition remains a challenge."}
{"answers": "Despite current recommendations, cough and cold medicines are still used in children younger than 6 years of age. A significant portion of caregivers report that they are still unaware of public warnings, potential side effects, and interactions with other medications.", "prediction_text": "Based on this study, there is evidence that caregivers of young children continue to use cough and cold medicines incorrectly despite FDA warnings."}
{"answers": "Vitamin C reduces the prevalence of complex regional pain syndrome after wrist fractures. A daily dose of 500 mg for fifty days is recommended.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that vitamin C may have a protective effect against complex regional pain syndrome in elderly women with wrist fractures, with a decreased prevalence in the vitamin C group compared to the placebo group. However, the effect of different doses of vitamin C on the occurrence of complex regional pain syndrome was not statistically significant. Early cast-related complaints were also found to be a predictor of complex regional pain syndrome."}
{"answers": "The tendency to clear one's plate when eating is associated with increased body weight and may constitute a risk factor for weight gain.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a tendency to clear one's plate completely during meals is associated with an increased risk of obesity."}
{"answers": "ACS is common in patients with SCD who present with fever and was grossly underestimated by evaluating physicians. History and physical examination appear to be of little value in defining which febrile patients require CXR. In view of the mortality and morbidity associated with ACS, empiric CXR should be considered when evaluating a febrile patient with SCD.", "prediction_text": "Clinical assessment alone has limited accuracy in identifying acute chest syndrome in febrile patients with sickle cell disease. CXR is necessary for accurate diagnosis."}
{"answers": "We conclude that the quality of rectal cancer excision, as defined by mesorectal grades, achieved by supervised colorectal trainees is comparable with that achieved by consultants.", "prediction_text": "According to this study, there was no statistically significant difference in the quality of TME (total mesorectal excision) surgery between consultants and supervised colorectal trainees."}
{"answers": "Dutch primary schools could play a more important role in fostering healthy eating habits among children. The school food policy could be improved by clearly formulating food rules, simplifying supervision of the food rules, and defining how to enforce the food rules. In addition, the school food policy will only influence children's dietary behaviour if both the school and the parents support the policy.", "prediction_text": "The findings suggest that while most Dutch primary schools have a written food policy, its implementation could be improved through clearer definition of rules and stronger enforcement. Parental support and involvement are also crucial for effective implementation."}
{"answers": "Speed discrimination, per se, is not impaired in schizophrenia patients. The observed abnormality appears to be a consequence of impairment in generating or integrating the feedback information from eye movements. This study introduces a novel approach to motion perception studies and highlights the importance of concurrently measuring eye movements to understand interactions between these two systems; the results argue for a conceptual revision regarding motion perception abnormality in schizophrenia.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that motion perception deficits in schizophrenia may not be solely due to eye-tracking abnormalities, as eye-tracking initiation during a speed discrimination task did not significantly affect motion perception thresholds in patients. However, the study does indicate that eye movements may interact with motion perception in schizophrenia, as patients showed higher speed discrimination thresholds and less correlation between eye-tracking frequency and motion perception at longer stimulus durations."}
{"answers": "(1) There is little overlap between regions of CFAEs during AF and regions of SRF measured in the time domain or the frequency domain, (2) the majority of SRF appears to occur in regions with wave-front collision, (3) the distribution of SRF is similar in patients with AF and normal controls, suggesting that this may not have an important role in AF maintenance and may not be a suitable ablation target.", "prediction_text": "There is no significant correlation between complex fractionated atrial electrograms recorded during atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm fractionation."}
{"answers": "Continence function remained undisturbed after anastomotic leakage due to rectal resection", "prediction_text": "Anastomotic leakage does not significantly affect long-term continence function after curative sphincter-preserving rectal cancer surgery. However, slight decreases in maximum tolerable volume and rectal compliance were observed in patients with anastomotic leakage."}
{"answers": "No evidence was found for OPLL to have any effect on the initial neurologic status or recovery in motor function after traumatic cervical cord injury, suggesting that the neurologic outcome is not significantly dependent on canal space.", "prediction_text": "In this study, the presence of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) at the site of injury did not significantly affect neurologic outcomes in patients with acute cervical spinal cord injury (SCI), as indicated by similar American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) motor scores and improvement rates between the OPLL+ and OPLL- groups. However, smaller static and dynamic canal diameters were observed in the OPLL+ group. No significant correlation was found between the canal diameters and neurologic outcome in all patients."}
{"answers": "Circumferences and related ratios scale significantly to height, notably after adjustment for age and race, across subjects who are representative of the US population. These observations have implications for the clinical and epidemiologic use of these anthropometric measures and indexes.", "prediction_text": "After adjusting for age and race, waist circumference and hip circumference scale negatively to height in both men and women, but with weaker associations compared to weight."}
{"answers": "We found evidence that pain can be a significant clinical problem in psychiatric patients which seems to be underestimated in psychiatry. The investigated patients in general adult psychiatry are characterized by specific risk factors different from clinical subpopulations of other disciplines.", "prediction_text": "Yes, pain is a common and clinically relevant problem in general adult psychiatry, with a high prevalence and significant impact on impairment and unfitness for work. Depression and a history of multiple psychiatric hospitalizations were identified as significant risk factors."}
{"answers": "This study found that influences on coping were multifactorial and moderated by age. These factors have implications for interventions designed to enhance coping strategies.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find evidence that age moderates the effect of personality disorder on coping style in psychiatric inpatients. Instead, age, personality traits, social supports, and gender were found to be significant predictors of coping strategies."}
{"answers": "The study data suggests a possible correlation between cervical discopathy and cervical MS plaque.", "prediction_text": "There is a significant association between the presence of cervical cord plaques and discopathy at the same site in patients with multiple sclerosis."}
{"answers": "Higher MCVs and AST/ALT ratios in ASH reflect the severity of underlying liver disease and do not differentiate NASH from ASH. Instead, these biomarkers might prove useful in guiding selection of patients for liver biopsy and in targeting therapy.", "prediction_text": "Elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and an AST/ALT ratio >1 are useful laboratory markers in distinguishing nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) from alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH). However, these markers should be used in conjunction with other clinical and diagnostic information."}
{"answers": "We found no evidence that IBR compromised the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy, although there was a significant incidence of implant infection.", "prediction_text": "Immediate breast reconstruction does not significantly delay the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy, but it is associated with a higher rate of tissue expander removal and a lower rate of seromas compared to mastectomy alone."}
{"answers": "Economic inequalities in breast and cervical cancer screening are low in LMICs with high screening coverage. These findings are consistent with the inverse equity hypothesis and indicate that high levels of equity in cancer screening are feasible even in countries with high income inequality.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that the inverse equity hypothesis may not hold true for cancer screening in the middle-income countries examined, as economic inequalities in screening coverage were lower or non-existent in countries with higher overall coverage."}
{"answers": "Post tonsillectomy antibiotics did not prove to have a role in minimizing postoperative morbidity. Moreover, analgesics given on the basis of as required had a limited value.", "prediction_text": "The use of antibiotics in tonsillectomy procedures did not significantly reduce postoperative morbidity, including pain control, fever, secondary hemorrhage, or length of hospital stay."}
{"answers": "The study findings suggest that adopting measurement-based care, such as using the PHQ-9, is achievable, even in practices with limited resources.", "prediction_text": "The study demonstrates that the systematic use of patient-rated depression severity monitoring using the Nine-Item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) is helpful and feasible in clinical psychiatry. It significantly influenced clinical decision making, leading to treatment changes in 40% of patient contacts, including adjusting medication dosages, adding medications, starting or increasing psychotherapy, and switching or initiating antidepressants. Additionally, it identified 3% of patients with increased suicide risk."}
{"answers": "There is no advantage to an intramedullary nail versus a sliding compression hip screw for low-energy pertrochanteric fractures AO/OTA 31-A1 and A2, specifically with its increased cost and lack of evidence to show decreased complications or improved patient outcome.", "prediction_text": "Based on the given study, there was no statistically significant difference in the treatment of pertrochanteric fractures between a sliding compression hip screw and an intramedullary nail in terms of operative times, difficulty of the operation, intraoperative complications, blood loss, fracture healing, failure of fixation, pain, social functioning score, and mobility score. Therefore, the choice between the two methods may depend on other factors, such as surgeon preference and patient-specific considerations."}
{"answers": "Just over half the patients in this present cohort may be physically able to undertake some aspects of self-managed foot care, including nail clipping and filing, callus filing and daily hygiene and inspection.", "prediction_text": "While most RA patients can participate in the FOOTSTEP self-management foot care programme, some may have difficulty due to age-related declines in sight, reach, and grip strength. These challenges are more common in older patients with longer disease duration and higher physical disability, pain, and general health scores."}
{"answers": "The homogeneity we found in the deprivation-mortality relationship across the regions of Scotland and the absence of a contextualized effect of region highlights the importance of taking a broader strategic policy that can combat the toxic impacts of socio-economic deprivation on health. Focusing on a few specific places (e.g. 15% of the poorest areas) to concentrate resources might be a good start but the impact of socio-economic deprivation on mortality is not restricted to a few places. A comprehensive strategy that can be sustained over time might be needed to interrupt the linkages between poverty and mortality.", "prediction_text": "The study found that deprivation is significantly correlated with all-cause mortality in all models, but contrary to the hypothesis, the relationship between deprivation and mortality did not vary between regions in Scotland."}
{"answers": "This study adds to the growing body of literature documenting the importance of the individual therapist as an important factor in the change process.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that while there is some variability in the effectiveness of cognitive processing therapy (CPT) for PTSD among therapists, certain therapist characteristics, such as effective addressing of patient avoidance, use of effective language in supervision, a flexible interpersonal style, and the ability to develop a strong therapeutic alliance, can contribute to better treatment outcomes."}
{"answers": "New depression diagnosis and antidepressant use was shown to be less likely in areas of higher own-ethnic density for some, but not all, ethnic groups.", "prediction_text": "Black and minority ethnic groups, particularly Pakistani, Indian, African, and Bangladeshi patients, are less likely to be newly diagnosed with depression or prescribed antidepressants compared to white British patients. An inverse relationship was found between neighborhood ethnic density and new depression diagnosis for some groups, but black Caribbean patients showed the opposite effect. The findings were similar for antidepressant prescribing, although the effect for black Caribbeans was no longer statistically significant."}
{"answers": "These findings suggest a malleable relationship between knee extensor strength, dynamic stability, and disease severity in PD. Although strength is only one piece of the puzzle in the functional outcome of PD, these findings may assist clinicians in designing appropriate interventions aimed at increasing function and decreasing fall risk in PD.", "prediction_text": "In Parkinson's disease, knee extensor strength positively correlates with dynamic postural stability and negatively correlates with disease severity. Dynamic postural stability also negatively correlates with disease severity and positively correlates with functional ambulation. The Functional Reach Test may be a valuable tool to assess postural stability."}
{"answers": "It is concluded that preloading colloid fluid prior to repositioning could prevent the decrease of systolic blood pressure and central venous pressure during sitting positioning without other complications.", "prediction_text": "Preloading with colloids 30 minutes before seated positioning in neurosurgical patients can help maintain systolic blood pressure and central venous pressure compared to crystalloid maintenance alone. No significant changes were observed in diastolic blood pressure or heart rate."}
{"answers": "Data from Safe Implementation of Treatments in Stroke-International Stroke Thrombolysis Register suggest that intravenous thrombolysis may modify the observed survival and recovery advantage for men expected in the natural course of an ischemic stroke, with a possible larger beneficial treatment effect in women when compared with men.", "prediction_text": "While there is no difference in the safety and efficacy of intravenous thrombolysis between men and women regarding functional outcome, women have a higher risk of mortality and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage."}
{"answers": "The rate of early infection without antibiotic prophylaxis before TIVAD placement in the interventional radiology suite is<1%. Based on these data, use of prophylactic antibiotics for TIVAD placement is not recommended.", "prediction_text": "The study found that out of 1,183 TIVAD placements, 7% of the removed devices within 30 days were associated with central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs). One of these infections occurred in a patient who received antibiotics on the day of implantation. Chemotherapy was also a risk factor for CLABSIs. However, the small sample size and retrospective design of the study limit the ability to draw definitive conclusions. Therefore, the need for prophylactic antibiotics during TIVAD placement remains a subject of ongoing debate."}
{"answers": "The PRP group recorded reduced pain, swelling, and trismus as well as enhanced and faster bone healing compared with those in the control. Hence the study showed that topical application of PRP gel has a beneficial effect in enhancing socket healing after third molar surgery.", "prediction_text": "The use of autologous platelet-rich plasma gel in the surgical extraction of mandibular third molars may lead to a decrease in postoperative pain, but its effect on healing and bone regeneration potential, as measured by swelling, trismus, and radiographic assessment, is not statistically significant."}
{"answers": "This study confirms that physicians often differ from patients in the assessment of QoL. This is most likely due to a difference in patient-physician perception of \"significant\" LUTS and clearly demonstrates the importance of patient evaluated QoL in routine clinical assessment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a discrepancy between patient and physician assessment of quality of life in women with lower urinary tract dysfunction, with physicians tending to underestimate the impact of symptoms on patients."}
{"answers": "Left ventricular dimensions are not influenced by MetS. Rather than MetS, hypertension is primarily responsible for changes in left ventricular dimensions. However, left atrial enlargement is more prominent in patients with MetS, suggesting that each MetS criterion contributes to left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.", "prediction_text": "Yes, metabolic syndrome is associated with increased left atrial diameter in hypertensive patients."}
{"answers": "A higher PV in PMR increases the risk of prolonged steroid therapy and late GCA. Female sex and particular HLA alleles may increase the risk of late GCA. Starting patients on>15 mg prednisolone is associated with a prolonged steroid duration.", "prediction_text": "Elevated plasma viscosity and high initial prednisolone dose are independent predictors of a longer duration of steroid therapy in polymyalgia rheumatica patients. Female sex, HLA-DRB1*0101 or -*0401 alleles, elevated plasma viscosity, and high initial prednisolone dose are potential predictors of late development of giant cell arteritis. However, no significant predictors of relapse were identified."}
{"answers": "The study suggests that there is no difference in clinical toxicity profiles or survival outcomes with either definitive chemoradiotherapy or chemoradiation followed by surgery in management of locally advanced esophageal cancer.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that surgical resection following chemoradiotherapy may improve local control in patients with resectable disease, but there is no significant difference in overall and disease-free survival between the two groups. The recurrence probability was higher in the chemoradiotherapy alone group, particularly for locoregional recurrence. However, the decision to perform surgery should be individualized based on patient factors and tumor characteristics."}
{"answers": "Our results give first evidence that lowered beta E during alcohol withdrawal may contribute to anxiety as a common disturbance during this state.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that there is an inverse relationship between beta-endorphin levels and anxiety during alcohol withdrawal, indicating that beta-endorphin deficiency may play a role in the development of anxiety in alcoholism. However, further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between beta-endorphin and anxiety, depression, and craving during alcohol withdrawal."}
{"answers": "Increased private health care activity does not reduce the demand for NHS care: NHS and private referral rates were positively associated with each other after adjusting for age, deprivation and practice.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that patients from more deprived areas have lower private referral rates and higher NHS referral rates compared to those from less deprived areas. The use of private health care does not necessarily reduce the demand for NHS care."}
{"answers": "Skewed X-inactivation is not associated with recurrent spontaneous abortion but is associated with increasing maternal age.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find a statistically significant association between recurrent spontaneous abortion and skewed X-inactivation in the given sample population. However, women with extreme skewing were on average 2 years older than those without extreme skewing."}
{"answers": "Findings suggest that analgesic management of daily pain is better for nursing home residents enrolled in hospice than for those not enrolled in hospice.The prescribing practices portrayed by this study reveal that many dying nursing home residents in daily pain are receiving no analgesic treatment or are receiving analgesic treatment inconsistent with AMDA and other pain management guidelines. Improving the analgesic management of pain in nursing homes is essential if high-quality end-of-life care in nursing homes is to be achieved.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that hospice residents were more likely to receive regular treatment for daily pain compared to non-hospice residents, despite a lower use of analgesics not recommended by AMDA. However, it's important to note that the study had some limitations, such as the retrospective design and potential for selection bias."}
{"answers": "The continuity-of-care experiences of vascular trainees are suboptimal. This is especially true for postoperative clinic assessment. Same-day admission surgery accounted for most of the cases and was associated with the poorest continuity of care. To provide complete surgical training in an era of changing therapeutic modalities and same-day admission surgery, vascular programs must be creative in structuring training to include adequate ambulatory experience.", "prediction_text": "The study indicates that residents in an academic vascular department have limited experience in providing complete surgical care, with low rates of preoperative assessment, involvement in decision-making, and follow-up clinic assessments. Emergent cases and elective cases admitted before the day of surgery received more preoperative assessment and decision-making involvement compared to same-day admission patients."}
{"answers": "Simple detorsion was not accompanied by an increase in morbidity, and all patients studied had functioning ovarian tissue on follow-up despite the surgeon's assessment of the degree of ovarian ischemia. Detorsion is the procedure of choice for most cases of ovarian torsion in children.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, detorsion alone may be an effective treatment option for ovarian torsion in children, and oophorectomy may not be necessary in all cases. However, the decision to perform detorsion or oophorectomy should be individualized based on the clinical presentation and intraoperative findings."}
{"answers": "Half-dose MR angiography using diluted contrast medium injected at a rate of 1 mL/second depicted the abdominal aorta and its branches as clearly as using a full single dose.", "prediction_text": "The results of this study suggest that half-dose contrast-enhanced three-dimensional MR angiography may have lower signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios compared to full-dose, but the overall image quality was not significantly different. Further research may be needed to determine if the lower dose is sufficient for clinical use."}
{"answers": "There was no evidence of a trend in unsafe sex behaviour over time. However, several subgroups were identified as being more likely to report unsafe sex and should be targeted for specific interventions.", "prediction_text": "Based on the data from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study, there was no evidence of an increase in reported unsafe sex over time among HIV-infected individuals. However, certain subgroups, such as females, younger individuals, those with HIV-positive partners, and those with occasional partners, were more likely to report unsafe sex."}
{"answers": "In normal clinical practice, chemotherapy significantly prolongs survival in patients with performance status of less than 2, more time being gained if there is no associated weight loss. We conclude that the reluctance shown by many pneumologists toward using this treatment is not entirely justified.", "prediction_text": "The study found that chemotherapy was an independent predictor of survival in advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma patients with ECOG scores of 0 to 1, suggesting that the skepticism of pneumologists towards this treatment may not be fully justified. However, the survival benefit was shorter in patients with an ECOG score of 2."}
{"answers": "The Medicaid Demonstration in Florida appears to result in lower PMPM expenditures. Demonstration PSNs generated slightly greater reductions in expenditures compared to Demonstration HMOs. PSNs appear to be a promising model for delivering care to Medicaid enrollees.", "prediction_text": "In Florida's Medicaid program, provider service networks resulted in lower per member per month expenditures compared with HMOs for both SSI and TANF enrollees."}
{"answers": "In this series, in accordance to available testosterone, the prevalence of PADAM was determined to be high, in which the ADAM questionnaire rendered a low diagnostic efficiency. PADAM diagnosis could be clinically suspected when symptoms of sexual dysfunction are present.", "prediction_text": "The Androgen Deficiency of Aging Men (ADAM) questionnaire has a moderate sensitivity (83.3%) but low specificity (19.7%) in the detection of Partial Androgen Deficiency of Aging Men (PADAM) based on the diagnosis using available testosterone levels as a gold standard. Item 1 (decreased sexual desire) showed better predictive value for hypogonadism than the complete questionnaire."}
{"answers": "We found that intrapartum VAS was an effective predictor of fetal acidosis in cases of FHR variable decelerations, but its predictability for fetal acidosis in cases of FHR late decelerations was limited. Both VAS and fetal blood pH are good predictors of neonatal morbidity.", "prediction_text": "Intrapartum vibroacoustic stimulation can be used as a predictor of fetal acidosis during labor, particularly when there is a negative response to the stimulation. However, the false negative rate for predicting no acidosis is higher in cases of late decelerations compared to variable decelerations. The predictability of neonatal morbidity is similar for both a negative VAS response and fetal acidosis."}
{"answers": "Emergency US fellowship programs had a positive impact on residents' US educational experiences. Emergency medicine residents performed more scans overall and also used bedside US for more advanced applications in programs with EUS fellowships.", "prediction_text": "Emergency ultrasound fellowships may provide additional opportunities for EM residents to perform more ultrasound examinations and expand their bedside US applications, but there is still a need for further research to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Obesity does not seem to impact the severity of injury, mortality rate, types of injury, and procedure outcomes in children. Obese patients are more likely to have rib and pelvic injuries.", "prediction_text": "Obese children have a higher injury severity score and longer hospital stays compared to non-obese children. They are more likely to have rib fractures and pelvic injuries. However, there is no significant association between obesity and mortality in injured children."}
{"answers": "The laparoscopic-assisted approach to Crohn's disease is feasible and safe with good outcomes. Co-morbid preoperative findings such as abscess, phlegmon, or recurrent disease at the previous ileocolic anastomosis are not contraindications to a successful laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resection in select patients.", "prediction_text": "Laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resections in patients with Crohn's disease can be successfully performed in the presence of an abscess or phlegmon, as well as recurrent disease at a previous anastomosis, although there may be increased operative blood loss, time, morbidity, and length of hospital stay compared to patients without these conditions."}
{"answers": "When controlling for preoperative features, the year in which RP was performed is a predictor of outcome on multivariate analysis. This effect could not be explained by stage migration.", "prediction_text": "The year in which radical prostatectomy was performed may be a predictor of treatment outcome in prostate cancer patients before surgery, but not after controlling for standard prognostic factors. However, the study suggests that patient outcome improved steadily with surgery through the mid 1990s and then appeared to level off."}
{"answers": "The menopausal transition warrants attention as a period of vulnerability to MDD recurrence, while health factors and VMS should be considered important risk factors for first lifetime-onset of MDD during midlife.", "prediction_text": "Women with and without prior major depression during midlife have different risk factors. Health conditions prior to baseline and during follow-ups, perception of functioning, and vasomotor symptoms were associated with first lifetime-onset major depression. Being peri- and post-menopausal, psychological symptoms, and a prior anxiety disorder were linked to major depression recurrence."}
{"answers": "Most children undergoing congenital heart surgery can be extubated in the operating room. Most neonates, including many undergoing complex procedures, can be extubated within the first 24 hours after surgery. Early extubation was associated with low morbidity rates and short lengths of intensive care unit and hospital stays.", "prediction_text": "Early extubation within the first 24 hours after congenital heart surgery in children, including neonates, is associated with lower mortality and a lower rate of reintubation. Factors predictive of delayed extubation include preoperative mechanical ventilation, weight less than 5 kg, longer procedure time, and the need for postoperative inotrope support. Implementation of an early extubation strategy results in low rates of complications, short lengths of ICU stay, and short hospital stays."}
{"answers": "A significant association between farming and PSV has been identified for the first time. Results also support previously reported associations with silica, solvents, and allergy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, environmental factors such as farming, high occupational silica and solvent exposure, drug allergy, and allergy overall are significantly associated with an increased risk of primary systemic vasculitis."}
{"answers": "This study that shows that adequate femoral tunnel lengths can be safely created without knee hyperflex - ion using flexible instruments via an anteromedial portal.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that with a flexible reamer system, femoral tunnel lengths greater than 20 mm can be created at 90\u00b0 of knee flexion, but there is a trend for increasing distances to the common peroneal nerve with increased flexion. The lateral structures, including the LCL, appear to be relatively safe with this technique. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings in a clinical setting."}
{"answers": "A proportionally longer treatment duration was identified as an adverse factor in low-risk patients. Treatment breaks resulting in a NTDR of>/=33% (e.g., four or more breaks during a 40-fraction treatment, 5 d/wk) should be avoided.", "prediction_text": "Longer treatment durations during external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer are associated with a higher risk of biochemical failure, particularly in low-risk patients."}
{"answers": "TEE allowed a diagnosis of site involvement that did correlate with the anatomic diagnosis obtained during the operation. This fact contributed to the management of patients and was of great help in guiding the surgical intervention. Echo-oriented single-valve replacement may be a safe strategy for patients with PVE and double prostheses.", "prediction_text": "In selected cases of prosthetic valve endocarditis with involvement of only one valve, single-valve replacement can be a safe and effective treatment option, with a high diagnostic accuracy of transesophageal echocardiogram and a good outcome in survivors. However, there is a risk of mortality within a week after the procedure in some patients."}
{"answers": "Acute hepatitis C in the post universal blood products screening era was found to be predominantly an iatrogenic disease in the investigated localities. This finding should direct attention and resources towards the development and implementation of preventive measures.", "prediction_text": "Yes, iatrogenic transmission is the most frequent mode of acute hepatitis C infection in Israel."}
{"answers": "Our results suggest a protective effect of breast-feeding among children with a family history of atopy that is not confined to the period of breast-feeding but continues during the first three years of life. Breast-feeding should be promoted in children with a family history of atopy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, breast-feeding is associated with lower rates of illness in children with a family history of atopy during the first year of life, particularly in terms of gastroenteritis, lower respiratory tract infections, and digestive tract disorders. Over the next three years of life, breast-feeding is also associated with fewer respiratory tract infections and skin infections."}
{"answers": "Transrectal ultrasound guided and fusion biopsy cancer detection rates decreased with increasing prostate volume. However, magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy had a higher prostate cancer detection rate compared to that of transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy in the literature. Magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy represents a promising solution for patients with suspicion of prostate cancer and an enlarged prostate.", "prediction_text": "Magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy can improve cancer detection in men with enlarged prostates, particularly those with larger glands, as shown in the study with a detection rate of 55%, which was significantly lower for prostates 115 cc or greater compared to smaller glands. However, the study also suggests that whole prostate volume measured by magnetic resonance imaging is an independent predictor of prostate cancer detection."}
{"answers": "There is no difference in postoperative morbidity, rates of rehospitalization, in-patient mortality or hospitalization costs in geriatric patients undergoing regional or general anesthesia for repair of hip fracture. Delay in surgery beyond 3 days and ICU admission both increase cost of hospitalization.", "prediction_text": "In this retrospective cohort study, there was no significant difference in hospitalization costs, morbidity, or mortality between geriatric patients who underwent surgery for hip fracture with regional anesthesia or general anesthesia. However, delay in surgery and ICU admission were associated with increased hospitalization costs."}
{"answers": "Mesocolon invasion should be included in T4 for the staging of gastric cancer.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that direct mesocolon invasion should be considered as an extension of T4 disease in the staging of gastric cancer. However, the study also indicates that the prognosis after curative resection for mesocolon invasion may be better than for other incurable factors. Further research is needed to establish a consensus on the optimal staging approach for gastric cancer with mesocolon invasion."}
{"answers": "Genetic variants identified in the present study may be insufficient to promote early carotid atherosclerosis.", "prediction_text": "Contrary to the observational data, the results of this study suggest that mutations causing low HDL-C do not necessarily lead to increased carotid intima-media thickness."}
{"answers": "The Turkish version of the EQ-5D-based utility score seems to be a valid instrument in the assessment of quality of life studies in patients with acute coronary syndrome.", "prediction_text": "The Turkish version of the EQ-5D shows construct validity in assessing quality of life in patients with acute coronary syndrome, as evidenced by significant correlations with the MacNew heart-related quality of life scale."}
{"answers": "We found an improved survival associated with cardiologist care and a mixture of general practitioner and cardiologist care compared with general practitioner care. The pattern of outpatient care may therefore be important for the survival of patients with CHF.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that patients with congestive heart failure who received care from both general medicine and cardiology clinics had a lower risk of death compared to those who received care from only one type of clinic or no clinic follow-up. However, the study does not definitively prove that specialty care improves survival, but rather suggests an association."}
{"answers": "Comparison of mother-offspring and father-offspring associations for BMI suggests that intergenerational acceleration mechanisms do not make an important contribution to levels of childhood BMI within the population. Associations at later ages and for different components of body composition now require study.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find evidence to suggest that the intrauterine environment influenced offspring obesity through maternal body mass index (BMI) to a greater extent than paternal BMI."}
{"answers": "TEE is useful to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors. An FAC less than 50% is present in 36% of potential heart donors. Because left ventricular dysfunction is often reversible shortly after transplantation, an FAC below 50% may not necessarily preclude the use of hearts for transplantation.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that heart donors with a fractional area change (FAC) below 50% may still be suitable for transplantation, as 36 out of 40 successfully transplanted hearts had an FAC above 50%. However, the study also indicates that donors with FAC below 50% carry a higher risk of complications and lower survival rates compared to those with FAC above 50%. Therefore, the decision to transplant a heart with a FAC below 50% should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account other factors and the availability of alternative donors."}
{"answers": "Pediatricians should be alert to the earliest manifestations of AEA. Awareness of choking games among the young and, of those, a subset who eventually progress to potentially fatal AEA is strongly encouraged among all primary care professionals who may be able to interrupt the behavior.", "prediction_text": "Autoerotic asphyxiation (AEA) is a clandestine practice among children, preteens, and adolescents that involves inducing hypoxia/anoxia to enhance sexual excitement, which can lead to unintended death. Pediatricians can increase their knowledge and awareness of AEA to identify the syndrome, provide support, and potentially prevent tragedies. Characteristic manifestations, prevalence, age range, methods, and gender weighting are presented in the study. AEA is a personalized, ritualized, and symbolic biopsychosocial drama that can result in fatal outcomes due to miscalculation of the risks involved."}
{"answers": "The whole-body MRI protocol for the detection of bone metastases could safely be limited to the T1w sequence in adults, especially at 3 T. There is no need for an additional STIR sequence. These initial results will have a major impact on the department's workflow if confirmed by larger studies as they will help reduce examination time and therefore save financial resources.", "prediction_text": "Based on the study, T1-weighted imaging is more effective than STIR imaging in the detection of bone metastases at both 1.5 T and 3 T. Therefore, STIR imaging cannot be reliably omitted in the diagnosis of bone metastases using MRI."}
{"answers": "This study found that there was poor agreement between the AD's decision and the subsequent MR's decision regarding the fitness of those seafarers who decided to appeal against the AD's initial assessment. The reasons for this are considered.", "prediction_text": "The agreement between Approved Doctors and Medical Referees in assessing a seafarer's fitness is poor. The reasons for disagreement include access to additional information, different interpretation of standards, and the experience and knowledge of the Medical Referees."}
{"answers": "In our study, we suggest that glomerular hyperfiltration due to pregnancy does not have adverse effects on kidney in women with more parities. Pregnancy may have possible protective mechanisms for kidney against adverse effects of glomerular hyperfiltration.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that women with more parities have higher glomerular filtration rates during pregnancy, but the data does not provide evidence that this hyperfiltration leads to kidney damage. Further research is needed to determine the long-term implications of this phenomenon."}
{"answers": "Implant coating with an antibacterial-loaded hydrogel reduces bacterial colonization and biofilm formation in vitro.", "prediction_text": "Yes, antibacterial-loaded hydrogel coatings, such as Disposable Antibacterial Coating (DAC) hydrogel, can reduce bacterial colonization and biofilm formation in vitro. The hydrogel effectively delivers antibacterial agents and exhibits both bactericidal and antibiofilm activity. The coating also shows good resistance to press-fit implant insertion."}
{"answers": "Location of death varies by country of birth. BAME groups are more likely to die in a hospital and less likely to die at home or in a hospice. Further investigation is needed to determine whether these differences result from patient-centred preferences, or other environment or service-related factors. This knowledge will enable strategies to be developed to improve access to relevant palliative care and related services, where necessary.", "prediction_text": "Ethnicity is associated with differences in place of death among cancer patients in the UK, with some ethnic groups more likely to die in hospitals and others in their homes. Specifically, those born in Asia and Africa were more likely to die in hospitals, while those from the Caribbean were less likely to die at home."}
{"answers": "Overall, 7% of women in our cohort met either clinical or molecular criteria for Lynch syndrome. All of these women had a prior history or a first-degree relative with an HNPCC-associated cancer. Limiting genetic evaluation to women with synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancer who have a family history suggestive of HNPCC may appropriately identify women with Lynch syndrome.", "prediction_text": "Among women with synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancers, those with a personal history or first-degree relative with an HNPCC-associated cancer, or those who meet Amsterdam criteria, have an increased likelihood of having a molecular defect associated with Lynch syndrome."}
{"answers": "CMV-IgM and IgG antibodies assessment was not a potential discriminative test to identify congenitally infected newborns. In addition, low birth weight and small head circumference at birth failed to predict congenital CMV infection. CMV-DNA detection in umbilical cord blood at the time of delivery using real-time PCR of all newborns is recommended as decisive, rapid and non-invasive test.", "prediction_text": "While low birth weight is not a definitive indicator of congenital cytomegalovirus infection, as evidenced by the detection of CMV-DNA in only one of the low birth weight newborns in this study, it may be used as a potential risk factor in conjunction with other diagnostic methods."}
{"answers": "The use of instrumental variables allowed us to demonstrate a significant relationship between better ambulatory process of care and better health-related quality of life. This finding underscores the importance of efforts to improve the process of care.", "prediction_text": "Yes, better process of care in ambulatory settings is associated with improved health-related quality of life outcomes for patients with chronic diseases. This was observed in a 30-month prospective cohort study after adjusting for burden of illness."}
{"answers": "To date, the newly developed Singapore equation is the most accurate BMR prediction equation in Chinese and is applicable for use in a large BMI range including those overweight and obese.", "prediction_text": "The current prediction equations for estimating basal metabolic rate (BMR) in Chinese adults may not be accurate for a large BMI range. The study suggests a new BMR prediction equation for Chinese adults, which showed a higher accuracy rate compared to commonly used equations for the whole range of BMI and for a BMI greater than 23."}
{"answers": "This preliminary study demonstrated that OSCE ratings by LEs and REs were reasonably comparable when using checklists. Remote examination may be a feasible and acceptable way of assessing students' clinical skills, but further validity evidence will be required before it can be recommended for use in high-stakes examinations.", "prediction_text": "Remote physician-examiners can participate in objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs) and their scores can correlate significantly with on-site examiners for certain stations, such as history taking, physical examination, and management. However, the correlation for global ratings is more varied. The acceptance of this new examination method is high among both remote examiners and students, despite some technological issues."}
{"answers": "ACR is an independent prognostic factor for maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes in suspected preeclampsia. ACR may be useful to inform risk predictions within a prognostic model.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the first urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) in women with suspected preeclampsia is an independent predictor of both maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes. A higher ACR is associated with increased odds of composite adverse outcomes for both the mother and the neonate, as well as reduced gestational age at delivery."}
{"answers": "The effect on venous pressures caused by the change in patient positioning alone during liver surgery does not affect the risk of venous air embolism.", "prediction_text": "Contrary to the general belief, there is no significant pressure gradient between the hepatic and central venous levels in any patient position during liver surgery, and therefore, the patient's position in a head-down tilt does not decrease the likelihood of a venous air embolism during the procedure."}
{"answers": "The observations from this study provide limited support for the possibility that occupational arsenic exposure could play a role in the development of diabetes mellitus. Many other metallic compounds are also used in art glass production, however, and there is a possibility of confounding.", "prediction_text": "There is a suggestive association between arsenic exposure in Swedish art glass workers and an increased risk of diabetes mellitus, particularly in those with concurrent cardiovascular disease."}
{"answers": "Hospital preparedness can be better defined by a fixed number of casualties rather than a percentile of its bed capacity. Only 20% of the arriving casualties will require immediate medical treatment. Implementation of this concept may improve the utilisation of national emergency health resources both in the preparation phase and on real time.", "prediction_text": "The current Israeli hospital readiness guidelines for multiple casualty incidents based on 20% of bed capacity may not accurately predict the number of casualties requiring immediate medical treatment, as only 79.2% of the casualties in the studied HMCIs needed such treatment. The severity distribution of injuries may provide more accurate predictions for surge capacity needs."}
{"answers": "While Italian primary care physicians appropriately target eradication therapy for H pylori infection in patients with peptic ulcer disease rather than nonulcer disease, the intervention was still underused in these patients. Improvements in this prescribing behavior are needed.", "prediction_text": "Primary care physicians more frequently prescribe eradication therapy for peptic ulcer disease than for nonulcer dyspepsia. However, a significant number of patients with a definitive diagnosis of peptic ulcer disease still did not receive eradication therapy."}
{"answers": "When cerebral hemispherectomy is performed to control seizures associated with very early (in utero) insult, it has been found that the remaining right hemisphere is still able to support reading and phonological processing skills that are normally mediated by the left hemisphere. Our results also suggest the existence of variability in individuals after hemispherectomy, even within groups having the same etiology and similar timing of insult.", "prediction_text": "In individuals who have undergone left cerebral hemispherectomy for intractable seizures, the right hemisphere can unexpectedly support spared phonological processing abilities, contributing to the development of average reading skills in about 60% of cases."}
{"answers": "Improved office-based practices regarding influenza vaccination could significantly impact Healthy People 2020 goals by increasing influenza vaccine uptake and reducing corresponding racial and ethnic disparities.", "prediction_text": "Yes, eliminating missed opportunities for influenza vaccination in office-based settings could potentially reduce racial and ethnic disparities in influenza vaccination by approximately half."}
{"answers": "The SPI was accurate in predicting the presence or absence of esophageal varices in patients with compensated cirrhosis.", "prediction_text": "The splenoportal index (SPI) obtained from duplex Doppler ultrasonography can be used as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for esophageal varices in patients with compensated hepatic cirrhosis, with a high negative predictive value and sensitivity when the SPI is less than 5.0, and a high positive predictive value and specificity when the SPI is 5.0 or higher."}
{"answers": "This study showed for the first time that RALP induces lower tissue trauma than RRP.", "prediction_text": "Based on the data from this study, robotically assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy does not appear to be less invasive than retropubic radical prostatectomy as indicated by higher levels of inflammatory markers (IL-6 and CRP) and lactate in the early post-operative period. However, it is important to note that all patients in this study underwent surgery in the same department and the sample size was relatively small. Further studies with larger sample sizes and more comprehensive evaluations of patient outcomes are needed to definitively answer this question."}
{"answers": "The researchers studied a defined skin care protocol using a cleanser with aloe vera and a cleansing lotion, followed by application of either a moisture barrier with silicone or skin protectant with zinc oxide and menthol, undertaken at two different frequencies. Data revealed the incidence of moderate IAD was decreased in the experimental group (receiving the skin protocol every 6 hours and p.r.n.).", "prediction_text": "Increasing the skin care protocol frequency from every 12 hours to every 6 hours reduces the severity of incontinence-associated dermatitis in critically ill patients."}
{"answers": "Patient coaching offers promise as a means of reducing racial/ethnic disparities in pain control. Larger studies are needed to validate these findings and to explore possible mechanisms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patient coaching can help reduce racial/ethnic disparities in cancer pain control. The study showed that minority patients in the experimental group, who received coaching, had similar pain control at follow-up as their white counterparts, while disparities persisted in the control group."}
{"answers": "The association between plasma glucose levels and CVD risk is mainly explained by insulin resistance, which raises the question of whether glucose lowering per se without changes in the processes that underlie hyperglycemia should be the sole clinical paradigm in the treatment of type 2 diabetes or its prevention.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that insulin resistance may explain the association between hyperglycemia and cardiovascular risk, as the relationship between fasting and 2-hour post oral glucose tolerance test plasma glucose levels and the Framingham risk score was no longer significant after adjusting for insulin sensitivity. However, insulin sensitivity remained significantly associated with the Framingham risk score even after adjusting for glucose levels."}
{"answers": "Tracheobronchoscopy is a useful and safe procedure and should be recommended in tertiary centers for babies with EA before surgical repair.", "prediction_text": "Preoperative tracheobronchoscopy in newborns with esophageal atresia can be clinically useful, particularly in modifying the surgical approach by detecting unsuspected anomalies and improving diagnosis. It can be crucial in 24.2% of cases."}
{"answers": "The recently released seventh edition of the primary tumor staging system for kidney tumors is a powerful predictor of CSS. However, some of the substages identified by the classification have overlapping prognoses, and other substages include patients with heterogeneous outcomes. The few modifications included in this edition may have not resolved the most critical issues in the previous version.", "prediction_text": "The 2009 TNM edition for primary tumor classification in renal cell carcinoma was validated in a large multi-institutional cohort, showing that it is an independent predictor of cancer-specific survival. However, the substratification of pT1 tumors did not retain independent predictive value, and limitations include retrospective design, lack of central pathologic review, and small patient numbers in some substages. Further studies may be needed to assess the clinical utility of these modifications."}
{"answers": "The Young-Burgess system is useful for predicting transfusion requirements. For the system to predict mortality or nonorthopaedic injuries, fractures must be divided into stable (APC1, LC1) and unstable (APC2, APC3, LC2, LC3, VS, combined mechanism of injury) types. LC1 injuries are very common and not always benign (overall mortality rate, 8.2%).", "prediction_text": "The Young-Burgess classification system can predict transfusion requirements in pelvic ring fracture patients, but its ability to predict mortality and non-orthopaedic injuries approaches, but does not reach, statistical significance. Dividing fractures into stable and unstable types can improve its predictive ability for mortality and abdomen injuries. The overall mortality rate in the study remained unchanged from historic controls."}
{"answers": "Parity is not directly linked to insulin sensitivity deterioration, to CP/FPG increase during pregnancy, or to GDM appearance, although it is linked through the mediation of progressive ageing and weight gain either before or during pregnancy, when there is a sufficiently long time interval between pregnancies.", "prediction_text": "Parity is associated with decreased insulin sensitivity during pregnancy, but this association is confounded by age, pregestational BMI, and weight gain. The increased risk of gestational diabetes with parity may be due to these confounding factors rather than parity itself."}
{"answers": "The relationship between cognitive functioning and recognition of frequency compressed speech-in-noise was not statistically significant. The findings may have been different if the participants had been provided with training and/or time to 'acclimatize' to the frequency-compressed conditions.", "prediction_text": "Cognitive function has a predictive role in unprocessed speech recognition but not in frequency-compressed speech recognition for listeners with normal hearing and normal cognition."}
{"answers": "We conclude that beta1Gly49 homozygosity and TACC haplotype of ADRB2 gene, both loss-of-function genetic variations, may predispose to TTN.", "prediction_text": "The beta1Ser49Gly polymorphism in the ADRB gene and the T-47C, A46G, C79G, and C491T (TACC) haplotype in the ADRB2 gene are associated with an increased risk for Transient Tachypnea of the Newborn (TTN)."}
{"answers": "MSWM does not appear to confer additional benefit as compared to the standard preoperative bariatric surgery protocol in terms of weight loss and most behavioral outcomes after LAGB in our patient population.", "prediction_text": "The results of this pilot randomized controlled trial suggest that participation in a medically supervised weight loss program prior to bariatric surgery does not significantly improve weight loss outcomes for laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. However, a positive effect on physical activity postoperatively was observed."}
{"answers": "TAVI can be performed safely without balloon predilatation and with the same early results as achieved with the standard procedure including balloon predilatation. The reduction in the number of pacing periods required may be beneficial for the patient.", "prediction_text": "Based on the study results, omitting balloon predilatation during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVI) does not appear to negatively impact early hemodynamic results or complication rates."}
{"answers": "In our study; sex is not a significant predictor of recanalization rate, time to recanalization or 3-month outcome in stroke patients following IV rt-PA.", "prediction_text": "The sex of acute stroke patients does not significantly influence the effectiveness of IV rt-PA treatment in terms of recanalization rates and poor 3-month outcomes."}
{"answers": "Serum sample might be alternatively used in the difficult time of getting tumor tissue for analyzing the status of EGFR mutation status in patients with advanced NSCLC.", "prediction_text": "Serum can be used as an alternative to tumor tissue for analyzing EGFR mutation status in advanced NSCLC patients, as there is a high correlation between mutations detected in serum and tumor samples, and the response to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors is significantly associated with the presence of EGFR mutations in both serum and tumor samples. However, overall survival does not significantly differ according to the status of EGFR mutations in both serum and tumor samples."}
{"answers": "Although the provision of high-quality evidence-based resources, electronic or otherwise, is essential for standardizing care and improving patient outcomes, the authors' findings demonstrate that this alone does not ensure uptake. It is important to understand end-users, the environment in which they operate, and the basic infrastructure required to implement such a system. Implementation must also be accompanied by continuing education and endorsement to ensure both long-term sustainability and use of the system to its full potential.", "prediction_text": "Web-based systems can be effective in standardizing care and improving patient outcomes in medical oncology, but their adoption and use can be influenced by various factors including hospital location, clinician roles, experience, hospital policy, endorsement, infrastructure, and education."}
{"answers": "This study has shown that being SGA was not a significant risk factor for any stage ROP or for severe ROP in this cohort and, also, that the risk factors for ROP were similar among SGA and AGA very-low-birth-weight preterm babies.", "prediction_text": "Being small for gestational age is a risk factor for retinopathy of prematurity, but the study found that after adjusting for other factors, weight gain from birth to the sixth week of life and need for blood transfusions were more significant risk factors for ROP in both small for gestational age and appropriate for gestational age groups."}
{"answers": "Frequent consumption of hamburgers showed a dose-dependent association with asthma symptoms, and frequent takeaway consumption showed a similar association with BHR.", "prediction_text": "Consuming hamburgers, particularly 1 or more times a week, is associated with an increased risk of having a history of wheeze and current wheeze in children. The association between takeaway consumption and exercise-induced bronchial hyperresponsiveness is uncertain."}
{"answers": "In patients with limb-threatening ischemia and lack of venous material for a straightforward venous femorocrural bypass, semi-closed endarterectomy of the superficial femoral artery combined with a short popliteo-crural bypass provides a good alternative.", "prediction_text": "The study reports a cumulative primary patency of 48.4% at 3 years and a limb salvage rate of 68.6% at 1 and 3 years for semiclosed endarterectomy of the superficial femoral artery combined with a short venous bypass in patients with critical leg ischemia and insufficient venous material. These results suggest that this procedure may be an alternative for limb-threatening ischemia, but the relatively low patency rates indicate that it may not be as effective as other revascularization techniques."}
{"answers": "Although the SLBM is quite repeatable, it underestimates mesopic pupil size and shows a too wide range of agreement with CIP. SLBM shows low sensitivity in detecting pupils larger than 6\u00a0mm, which may be misleading when planning anterior segment surgery. Previous grading-consensus training strategies may increase interrater reproducibility, and compensation for the systematic underestimation could improve accuracy of the SLBM.", "prediction_text": "The slit-lamp biomicroscopy-based method (SLBM) for measuring pupil diameter using cobalt blue light has moderate agreement with Colvard infrared pupillometry (CIP) for measuring mesopic pupil size. However, SLBM has lower sensitivity and specificity compared to CIP for detecting pupils larger than 6 mm."}
{"answers": "Although there are different patterns of atrophy across the different FTLD-TDP types, it appears that genetic and pathologic factors may also affect the patterns of atrophy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, different TDP-43 types in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) are associated with distinct patterns of brain atrophy on MRI. FTLD-TDP type 1 shows frontotemporal and parietal atrophy, type 2 predominantly anterior temporal lobe atrophy, and type 3 predominantly posterior frontal atrophy. Additionally, within the FTLD-TDP type 1 group, those with a progranulin mutation had more lateral temporal lobe atrophy."}
{"answers": "A set of educational interventions designed for cancer patients significantly improved their satisfaction with information on clinical research, but did not improve clinical trial enrollment of these participants as of 1 year after the study.", "prediction_text": "Increased patient awareness through educational interventions may improve patient satisfaction with information regarding clinical trials, but it does not necessarily lead to an increase in accruals to cancer-related clinical trials."}
{"answers": "There was little evidence that people at high risk of falls received systematic falls risk assessment during rehabilitation. When a risk was identified, generally a strategy was implemented. However, failure to assess some risk factors might have limited fall prevention strategies offered. Failure to adequately address risks during hospitalization could contribute to falls post-discharge. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2016; 16: 570-576.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that there is a gap between the identification of falls risk and the implementation of appropriate fall prevention strategies for patients at high risk of falls during rehabilitation and at discharge. The findings indicate that falls risk was not consistently identified and documented, and only a limited number of fall prevention strategies were implemented. Therefore, it appears that guidelines for falls prevention in this population are not being met adequately."}
{"answers": "Although most Medicare beneficiaries who received a new CIED between 2005 and 2009 did not have an initial in-person CIED follow-up visit within 2 to 12 weeks after device implantation, the rate of initial follow-up improved appreciably over time. This CIED follow-up visit was significantly more common in white patients than in patients of other races.", "prediction_text": "The study showed that while the number of patients attending in-person follow-up visits within 2 to 12 weeks and 0 to 16 weeks after implantation of cardiovascular implantable electronic devices increased over time, only 78.0% of the overall population had at least one in-person visit within one year. The follow-up rate was higher among white patients compared to black and other races. The findings suggest that while there has been improvement in adherence to experts' recommendations for follow-up, there is still a significant number of patients who do not attend follow-up visits within recommended timeframes."}
{"answers": "According to our study, there is a great variability when different brands and models of scanners are compared directly. Furthermore, the CT scan analysis and HU evaluation appears to gather insufficient information in order to characterize and identify the composition of renal stones.", "prediction_text": "CT scanner models may not consistently provide identical information regarding urinary stone compositions based on CT attenuation values. Significant overlaps and differences in mean CT attenuation values were observed among different stone types and scanner models. Therefore, caution should be exercised when interpreting CT scan results for urinary stone identification across different CT scanner models."}
{"answers": "Ophthalmic pathology and basic science research show that SBK and ASA are improvements in excimer laser keratorefractive surgery compared to conventional LASIK or PRK, particularly with regard to maintaining corneal biomechanics and perhaps moderately reducing the risk of corneal haze. However, most of the disadvantages caused by wound healing issues remain.", "prediction_text": "PRK and advanced surface ablation (ASA), and secondarily sub-Bowman's keratomileusis (SBK), have different biomechanical and wound healing characteristics after excimer laser keratorefractive surgery. PRK and ASA may be biomechanically safer than conventional LASIK in reducing the risk for causing keratectasia, but all techniques have disadvantages due to inadequate reparative wound healing in the adult human corneal stroma. ASA may still result in corneal haze or breakthrough haze, while SBK has the potential for interface wound complications."}
{"answers": "The Internet would be a practical and accessible way of delivering sexual health education to young people, particularly if it is incorporated into activities and websites they enjoy.", "prediction_text": "Based on the study, there is a potential for the Internet to improve sexual health awareness among web-savvy young people, as indicated by their interest in using a genitourinary medicine website and a 'question line' feature. However, it is important to note that the study did not find any evidence of current use of the Internet for health information related to sexual health."}
{"answers": "Ultrasound not only has comparable sensitivity to that of X-ray for the identification of limb fractures but is also equally effective for the diagnosis of fracture type and dislocation. Thus, ultrasound can be used as an adequate alternative method to X-ray for pediatric fracture diagnosis.", "prediction_text": "Ultrasound and X-ray have their advantages and limitations in pediatric fracture diagnosis. Ultrasound is superior for dislocation identification, while X-ray is better for detecting fracture type. However, neither method is statistically significantly superior to the other when adjusting for multiple testing."}
{"answers": "Although initial infection control rate was substantially lower in the retention group than the removal group, final results were comparable at latest followup. We believe retention treatment can be selectively considered for non-S. aureus infection, and when applied in selected patients, polyethylene exchange should be performed.", "prediction_text": "Implant retention can be considered for treatment of infected total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in select cases, such as those with Staphylococcus aureus infection and without polyethylene nonexchange. However, it is important to note that infection control rates are generally lower in the initial stages of treatment with implant retention compared to two-stage revision surgery. Long-term infection control rates can be comparable between the two treatments."}
{"answers": "The observed socioeconomic, demographic and microbiological differences between unmarried and married women could be responsible for the poor pregnancy outcome among unmarried pregnant women in Poland. Unmarried pregnant women should be covered by comprehensive medical care even before pregnancy. Further studies taking into account the role of psychological stress, patterns of sexual behavior and substance abuse during pregnancy could help identify the factors responsible for adverse pregnancy outcome among unmarried pregnant women.", "prediction_text": "The study found that unmarried pregnant women in Poland had a higher risk for certain microbiological factors, specifically Mycoplasma hominis, which may contribute to poor pregnancy outcomes such as preterm delivery and intrauterine growth restriction. However, the association was significant only for M. hominis and was also influenced by the young age of the subject and a low concentration of Lactobacillus spp. in the lower genital tract. Other socioeconomic factors, such as younger age, primary educational level, and poor economic situation, were also associated with an increased risk of bacterial vaginosis and poor pregnancy outcomes among unmarried women."}
{"answers": "In conclusion, concept mapping has a positive effect on students' academic achievement. These findings could provide valuable evidence for establishing concept mapping as a continuous teaching strategy for nursing students.", "prediction_text": "Yes, based on the findings of this study, concept mapping can enhance the learning outcomes of nursing students as evidenced by higher mean scores on cumulative tests compared to the traditional quiz method. Additionally, there was a gradual increase in the mean scores of developed maps during the intervention period."}
{"answers": "In this nationally representative population-based survey, HCMV seropositivity is associated with hypertension in women in the NHANES population. This association is largely explained by the association of hypertension with age and the increase in past exposure to HCMV with age.", "prediction_text": "In women, there is an association between human cytomegalovirus infection and hypertension, but this association is attenuated after adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, body mass index, diabetes status, and hypercholesterolemia. The evidence in men is less clear."}
{"answers": "Although the cost-effectiveness of a single-pill strategy was within the acceptable willingness-to-pay threshold, the QALY difference were minimal. Further research is recommended to explore the long-term impact of the strategy.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find a statistically significant difference in utility (quality of life) between HIV/AIDS patients receiving antiretroviral agents in a fixed-dose combination (FXD) versus multiple free doses (FRC). However, the FXD strategy was more costly and had a higher probability of being cost-effective in a sensitivity analysis. Therefore, while the FXD strategy may reduce pill burden and potentially enhance medication adherence, the impact on quality of life is uncertain based on the findings of this study."}
{"answers": "2ME is able to enhance the antiproliferative activity of certain chemotherapeutics at pharmacological relevant concentrations. This estradiol metabolite is currently in a phase II trial in patients with refractary metastatic breast cancer and the tolerability has been shown to be very good. The combination of 2ME with chemotherapeutics may therefore offer a new clinically relevant treatment regimen for hormone-dependent cancer.", "prediction_text": "The combination of 2-methoxyestradiol with epirubicin and carboplatin may result in an additive inhibitory effect on the proliferation of human ovary cancer cells, potentially allowing for lower dosages of chemotherapeutics in the treatment of ovarian cancer. However, further research is needed to confirm this finding and evaluate the safety and efficacy of this combination in clinical settings."}
{"answers": "Follow-up after endometrial cancer treatment varies in Italy. In this retrospective study, women with asymptomatic recurrence have shown a better clinical outcome compared with those with symptomatic relapse. The optimal approach is actually unknown, and guidelines comparing follow-up protocols have not been established. Prospective cost-effectiveness studies are needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, imaging modalities and clinical visits are the most common methods for detecting asymptomatic endometrial cancer relapses during follow-up. However, symptoms at recurrence can also influence survival outcomes."}
{"answers": "Lower Infundibular height could be a good measurement tool for deciding which patients with lower calyceal lithiasis would benefit from SWL treatment. Height of less than 22 mm suggests a good outcome from lithotripsy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, infundibular height can be used as a predictive factor for the clearance of lower pole calyceal stones after extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy. Patients with a shorter infundibular height are more likely to have residual fragments."}
{"answers": "The interval from the onset of clinical symptoms to the initial surgical intervention seems to be the most important prognostic factor with a significant impact on outcome. Despite extensive therapeutic efforts, Fournier's gangrene remains a surgical emergency and early recognition with prompt radical debridement is the mainstays of management.", "prediction_text": "Fournier's gangrene remains a serious condition with significant morbidity and mortality despite antibiotics and aggressive debridement. A low leukocyte count at presentation may be associated with better outcomes, while a high leukocyte count may be a prognostic indicator of mortality."}
{"answers": "These four cases may belong to a variant form of HAM/TSP, predominantly involving the cervical cord levels.", "prediction_text": "The case series suggests that the patients with chronic progressive cervical myelopathy and HTLV-I infection may represent a variant form of HAM/TSP, with different clinical and neuroradiologic presentations. Further research is needed to confirm this association."}
{"answers": "The results of the current study demonstrated that there are factors that increase the risk of a leakage which would enable surgeons to define risk groups, to more carefully select patients, and to offer a closer follow-up during the postoperative course with early recognition and adequate treatment. All future efforts should be focused on a further reduction of serious complications to make the LSG a widely accepted and safer procedure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, several factors have been identified as increasing the risk of staple line leakage in patients undergoing primary sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity. These include male gender, higher BMI, concomitant sleep apnea, conversion to laparotomy, longer operation time, use of both buttresses and oversewing, and the occurrence of intraoperative complications. However, on multivariate analysis, only longer operation time and the year of procedure had a significant impact on staple line leak rate."}
{"answers": "Font influenced pregnant women's ratings of intervention complexity.", "prediction_text": "The title and font of participant information sheets for an antenatal intervention can influence pregnant women's perceptions of the intervention, with the Double Awkward condition being perceived as more complex compared to other conditions. However, the study did not investigate the impact on recruitment and participation."}
{"answers": "Results of this survey highlight the wide variety of practice patterns in the US for handling surgical margins in breast-conservation treatment. This issue remains controversial, with no prevailing standard of care. Consequently, additional study is needed in the modern era of multimodality treatment to examine the minimal amount of surgical treatment necessary, in conjunction with chemotherapy and radiation, to attain adequate local control rates in breast-conservation treatment.", "prediction_text": "There is no clear consensus among breast surgeons regarding the optimal practices for attaining negative (tumor-free) surgical margins in breast-conservation treatments for breast cancer. The study revealed significant variability in clinical practices and decision-making."}
{"answers": "The findings showed that acupuncture of voice-related acupoints could bring about improvement in vocal function and healing of vocal fold lesions.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that both genuine and sham acupuncture showed improvement in vocal function and perceived quality of life for individuals with phonotraumatic vocal pathologies. However, only genuine acupuncture resulted in structural improvements and a reduction in the size of vocal fold lesions."}
{"answers": "A policy of early cesarean delivery in eclampsia, carrying \u226534 weeks, is not associated with better outcomes.", "prediction_text": "The results of this study suggest that there is no clear evidence to support a significant difference in maternal and perinatal outcomes between cesarean and vaginal delivery in women with eclampsia. However, a lower neonatal event rate was observed in the cesarean delivery group, but the difference was not statistically significant."}
{"answers": "Based on data derived from self-reported health conditions, and not withstanding the limitations of such a study, we conclude that there is good evidence to suggest that individuals with moderate to severe periodontal disease are at higher risk of suffering from rheumatoid arthritis and vice versa.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant association between rheumatoid arthritis and periodontal disease, with a higher prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis and advanced periodontal disease in individuals referred for periodontal treatment compared to those attending for routine dentistry."}
{"answers": "Present audit shows that the process of implementation of labor analgesia was quick, successful and safe, notwithstanding the identification of one cluster of women with suboptimal response to epidural analgesia that need to be further studies, overall pregnant womens'adhesion to labor analgesia was satisfactory.", "prediction_text": "The implementation of epidural analgesia for labor has increased significantly and the majority of patients reported good satisfaction levels. However, not all women may benefit equally from epidural analgesia, as indicated by the identification of two clusters with varying degrees of pain relief. Further research is needed to determine the reasons for this variability and to improve the effectiveness of epidural analgesia for all women."}
{"answers": "The residency training sites of the Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine provide patient care opportunities similar to those found in a national survey of family and general practitioners.", "prediction_text": "The patient characteristics, reasons for visit, diagnoses, preventive and therapeutic services, diagnostic services, consultations, and hospitalization rates at family practice residency teaching sites in northeast Ohio were similar to those reported in the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, indicating that family practice at these residency sites reflects community practice. However, fewer diagnostic services were performed at the residency sites."}
{"answers": "Our findings suggest that, in HT+ postmenopausal women, the rs2813544 polymorphism may influence LDL-C levels and, as previously described, ESR2 rs1256049 is associated with T-chol and LDL-C. No previous study has investigated the association of this SNP set with lipoprotein levels in women while taking into account the hormonal status of the patients.", "prediction_text": "Polymorphisms in the oestrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) and oestrogen receptor 2 (ESR2) genes are associated with lipid levels, specifically low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), in postmenopausal women undergoing hormone therapy (HT). Specifically, the ESR1 rs2813544 polymorphism and one ESR2 gene haplotype are implicated."}
{"answers": "The prevalence of PAD is high in nursing home residents. AAI is not predictive for IHD mortality in this population. In very frail elderly traditional risk factors and PAD are less important predictors of death compared to poor functional status, nutritional factors and previous cardiovascular disease.", "prediction_text": "The presence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) as assessed by an ankle-arm index (AAI) measurement was not predictive for cardiovascular mortality in older patients living in nursing homes. However, low hemoglobin values, previous cerebrovascular disease, polypharmacy, and poor mobility conditions were independently related to increased risk of cardiovascular mortality."}
{"answers": "The data demonstrate that vaccination has a relatively weak and short-lasting effect in old age. The results of the study should stimulate discussions about strategies how vaccinations can be made more effective in old age. Improved campaigns, shortened vaccination intervals as well as the design of novel vaccines tailored to fulfill the specific demands of the aging immune system are imaginable.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that many elderly persons in Austria are not adequately protected against infectious diseases despite vaccination, due to both inconsistent vaccination histories and decreased antibody response and duration of immunity."}
{"answers": "The introduction of a discharge coordinator improved the quality of discharge planning, but at additional cost.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the introduction of a dedicated discharge coordinator resulted in an improved discharge planning process and a reduction in problems experienced by patients after discharge. However, there was no evidence of more timely or effective provision of community services or improved appropriateness or efficiency of bed use."}
{"answers": "Local anesthesia is not required to lower a patient's pain intensity when applying intra-articular contrast media for MR arthrography of the shoulder. This could result in reduced costs and a reduced risk of adverse reactions, without an impact on patient comfort.", "prediction_text": "According to this study, the use of local anesthesia during MR arthrography of the shoulder does not significantly reduce pain intensity compared to no anesthesia. However, there was a significant difference in subjective pain perception between men and women."}
{"answers": "A routinely inserted ENBD tube did not improve the clinical course, despite patients having to endure increased procedure time and discomfort, and the insertion would therefore be unnecessary.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this prospective, randomized study, there is no significant difference in the recurrence rate of cholangitis or length of hospital stay between patients with choledocholithiasis-induced acute cholangitis who underwent endoscopic clearance of common bile duct stones with or without the insertion of an endoscopic nasobiliary drainage tube. However, the procedure time was longer and the discomfort score was higher in the ENBD group. Therefore, the routine use of ENBD tube after endoscopic clearance of common bile duct stones in patients with choledocholithiasis-induced cholangitis"}
{"answers": "Regarding the pedigree, we discuss different modes of inheritance. The presence of consanguineous unions in this family suggests the possibility of a common ancestor and thus a recessive autosomal mode of inheritance.", "prediction_text": "This study suggests that there may be a hereditary factor contributing to the development of nasal polyposis in the family studied, as a higher prevalence of the condition was observed compared to the general population. However, further research is needed to confirm this finding."}
{"answers": "Emergency DBE is feasible, safe and effective in acute OGIB and may avoid major surgery, diagnosing and successfully treating most patients. Combined approach with RT viewing by CE is especially useful to identify recurrent bleeding vascular lesions such as DL that may be easily misdiagnosed by non-emergency DBE.", "prediction_text": "The retrospective study suggests that the combined use of emergency double-balloon enteroscopy and real-time viewing capsule endoscopy is a feasible approach for managing acute overt-obscure gastrointestinal bleeding. This combination can increase the detection rate of lesions, particularly Dieulafoy's lesions, and facilitate endoscopic hemostasis."}
{"answers": "Laparoscopic antireflux surgery significantly improved quality of life in reflux patients whose symptoms were well controlled on medical therapy. Although on the basis of a noncomparative trial with a relatively short follow-up period, we believe such patients should be considered for laparoscopic antireflux surgery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, according to this study, laparoscopic antireflux surgery can lead to improved quality of life in patients with well-controlled gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. The study showed significant improvements in various quality-of-life measures, including physical and mental health, psychological well-being, and gastrointestinal symptoms, 6 months after surgery."}
{"answers": "Patients in regional and rural settings were willing partners in developing skills of junior medical students, who had greater involvement in patient consultations than previously reported for urban students. Our study extends the findings from urban general practice that patients are underutilised partners in community-based medical training. The support of patients from regional and rural settings could facilitate the expansion of primary care-based medical education in these areas of workforce need.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patients in regional and rural Australia are generally willing participants in community-based medical education, with a positive attitude towards their role in teaching medical students during consultations."}
{"answers": "Overall, in a US Air Force population, OSA does not predict a decrease in aerobic fitness as measured by cycle ergometry. However, patients with an apnea-hypopnea index of greater than 20 have a statistically significant decrease in aerobic fitness compared to the normal population. This study demonstrates the effects of OSA on aerobic fitness. Further correlation of fitness testing results with OSA severity and treatment is needed.", "prediction_text": "Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with reduced aerobic fitness in some patients, as indicated by lower maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max) in those with severe apnea-hypopnea index (AHI > 20), despite no improvement after medical or surgical treatment."}
{"answers": "Pictorial HWLs with didactic textual forms seem to work better than those with testimonial narratives. Future research should determine which pictorial HWL content has the greatest real-world impact among consumers from disadvantaged groups, including assessment of how HWL content should change to maintain its impact as tobacco control environments strengthen and consumer awareness of smoking-related risks increases.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that didactic pictorial warning labels with images of diseased organs can be more effective in increasing credibility, relevance, and impact on smoking-related health risks, especially among individuals with higher educational attainment. However, further research is needed to determine if these labels can effectively address smoking-related health disparities."}
{"answers": "Preferential transmission of AVPR1A to hypersexual or uninhibited people-seeking probands was not supported.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find a significant association between the number of arginine vasopressin V1a receptor microsatellites and hypersexuality in children with a prepubertal and early adolescent bipolar disorder phenotype."}
{"answers": "We suggest that regardless of family history, all children over 5 years should be screened for hyperlipidemia. Education about hyperlipidemia and precautions for its complications should be given to both children and families. The best and easiest way to reach children is to screen them at schools. School is also a good place for education of children about hyperlipidemia and risk factors.", "prediction_text": "The family history of hyperlipidemia was not found to be a reliable predictor of high cholesterol or LDL-cholesterol levels in school children. Other factors may need to be considered for cholesterol screening in this population."}
{"answers": "These data indicate digoxin use may be associated with a reduction in risk of PCa. Given the potential mechanisms by which digoxin may exert an anti-neoplastic effect and other recent studies showing a negative association between digoxin use and PCa, further research is warranted.", "prediction_text": "The use of digoxin for cardiovascular disease may be associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer, according to this study. However, the findings should be interpreted with caution due to the observational nature of the study and the need for further research to confirm these results."}
{"answers": "GHD men receiving GH treatment have a mortality rate not different from the background population. In women, after exclusion of high-risk patients, mortality was not different from the background population except for CVD. Mortality due to malignancies was not elevated in adults receiving GH treatment. Next to gender, the heterogeneous etiology is of influence on mortality in GHD adults with GH treatment.", "prediction_text": "The available data from this nationwide cohort study suggest that growth hormone replacement therapy may not significantly reduce all-cause or cause-specific mortality in adults with growth hormone deficiency. However, the study did identify sex, GHD onset, age, and underlying diagnosis as influencing factors on mortality."}
{"answers": "It seems quite admissible and justified to encourage medical students to officiate as examiners in undergraduate emergency medicine OSCE formative testing, but not necessarily in summative assessment evaluations.", "prediction_text": "Student examiners can be used as substitute examiners in an undergraduate OSCE on medical emergencies, but there may be small differences in examinee performance and evaluation between student and faculty examiners."}
{"answers": "Expression of ER is a constitutional feature of the connective tissue and smooth muscle cells of the anal continence organ. Estrogen receptors and PR are not detectable in the striated muscle fibers of the external anal sphincter in either sex. The presence of ER in the stroma and smooth muscles of the anal canal suggests that these tissues are targets for estrogen. This constitutes a theoretical basis for the beneficial effects of estrogen and progestin replacement on anal continence in postmenopausal women.", "prediction_text": "The presence of estrogen and progesterone receptors in the smooth muscle cells of the internal sphincter and perimuscular connective tissue of the anal canal in females suggests a potential role for hormones in the regulation of anal continence. Further research is needed to determine the exact mechanism of this hormonal influence."}
{"answers": "In women with bothersome MUI, concomitant AA repair does not result in additional improvement in OAB symptoms over MUS alone. Patients with postoperative complications exhibit less improvement in OAB symptoms.", "prediction_text": "The results of this study did not show a significant difference in the improvement of overactive bladder symptoms between women undergoing midurethral sling alone and those undergoing concomitant midurethral sling and anterior/apical repair."}
{"answers": "An association was found between sublingual varices and hypertension. Examining the lateral borders of the tongue is easily done, causes no harm and could be a valuable method for the dental profession to take active part in preventive healthcare.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant association between the presence of sublingual varices and hypertension. Patients with sublingual varices had a higher mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared to those without varices. The positive predictive value of sublingual varices for hypertension is 0.5, and the negative predictive value is 0.80."}
{"answers": "Our data suggested that visually impaired pedestrians can make accurate and reliable street crossing decisions like those of normally sighted pedestrians. When using auditory information only, all subjects significantly overestimated the vehicular gap time. Our finding that blind pedestrians performed significantly worse than either the normally sighted or visually impaired subjects under the hearing only condition suggested that they may benefit from training to improve their detection ability and/or interpretation of vehicular gap times.", "prediction_text": "Normally sighted and visually impaired pedestrians are accurate and reliable in their street crossing decision-making ability when using visual or visual and auditory information. Blind pedestrians are less accurate but reliable when using only auditory information for street crossing decisions."}
{"answers": "Initial single scrotal incision can be recommended for orchidopexy, even in the more difficult cases of impalpable undescended testes. Advantages seem to include shorter operative time, a cosmetically appealing single incision, and possibly less pain. The scrotal incision technique significantly reduces the need for laparoscopy in impalpable testes. Surprisingly, it even allows successful orchidopexy of abdominal testes, provided an open processus is present.", "prediction_text": "The scrotal approach to orchidopexy can be considered as a first choice for both palpable and impalpable undescended testes due to its advantages in easy detection of atrophic testes or testicular remnants and high success rate in diagnosing and treating impalpable testicles, with a low rate of postoperative complications."}
{"answers": "Center differences in enteral feeding advancement occur and may have a significant impact on short-term outcomes such as nosocomial sepsis. Large, multicenter, prospective trials are required to further elucidate the optimal feeding strategy for VLBW infants.", "prediction_text": "The study found that rapid enteral feeding advancement in very low birth weight infants was associated with a lower rate of sepsis and less use of central venous lines and antibiotics compared to slow advancement in the short-term."}
{"answers": "There appears to be no difference in the numbers of emboli detected when the first vascular clamp is applied to the proximal aorta or iliacs.", "prediction_text": "The sequence of clamp application during open abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery does not significantly influence distal embolisation based on the number of emboli detected with Transcranial Doppler ultrasound. However, current smoking was associated with a higher number of emboli."}
{"answers": "GP hospitals seem to reduce the utilisation of general hospitals with respect to admissions as well as occupied bed days.", "prediction_text": "Yes, populations with access to general practitioner hospitals have lower rates of admissions and occupied bed days in general hospitals compared to those without such access. This effect is particularly noticeable for patients with respiratory diseases, cardiac failure, cancer, stroke, and fractures."}
{"answers": "The EBP unit was associated with better patient outcomes and more efficient performance than achieved by the same physicians previously or by SP concurrently.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that evidence-based practice (EBP) can lead to improved patient outcomes, as evidenced by a decrease in mortality and length of stay for EBP patients compared to standard practice patients, despite the EBP doctors attending twice as many patients. However, it's important to note that this is just one study and more research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Although travel burden is associated with timely diagnosis and treatment for some types of cancer, we did not find evidence that driving time was, in general, better at predicting timeliness of cancer diagnosis and treatment than driving distance. More intensive efforts at early detection of breast cancer and early treatment of CRC for Medicaid patients who live in remote areas may be needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, longer driving distances and times to reach a provider are associated with later cancer stage at diagnosis and longer time-to-treatment for Medicaid patients with breast, colorectal, and lung cancer."}
{"answers": "Our results indicate that training managers in transformational leadership behaviours may have a positive impact on healthcare workers' health over time. However, more research is needed to examine the mechanisms by which transformational leadership brings about improved sleep quality; self-efficacy was not found to be the explanation.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that self-efficacy did not mediate the relationship between transformational leadership behaviors and healthcare workers' sleep quality."}
{"answers": "The use of US helps in making a correct diagnosis and in the follow-up with objective criteria and also convinces the patient and the family that the treatment needs to be continued.", "prediction_text": "Ultrasound can be a useful objective tool in diagnosing constipation in children and monitoring response to treatment. The study suggests that a rectal diameter cutoff of 2.44 cm can be used for diagnosis, with good sensitivity and specificity. However, normalization of rectal diameter may not be achieved even after treatment."}
{"answers": "Brachytherapy with ruthenium applicators is an effective therapy for small- and medium-size posterior uveal melanomas. Our results are comparable to other series. The treatment outcome does not seem to be capable of improvement by increasing the apical dose. An internationally accepted model for defining the dosage in brachytherapy is needed.", "prediction_text": "The literature suggests that there is ongoing debate regarding the optimal apical dose prescription (100 vs. 160 Gy) for treating posterior uveal melanomas with 106Ru plaque beta-ray radiotherapy. The study reports a median apical dose of 120 Gy and a 5-year survival rate of 90% and 92% for overall and disease-specific survival, respectively. The main side effects were mostly uncomplicated retinopathy and macular degeneration or scarring, leading to poor central vision in 30% of cases. The study did not provide evidence that escalating the apical dose significantly changes the treatment outcome."}
{"answers": "The addition of epinephrine to ACLS-SAPO increases vital organ perfusion pressures and improves outcome from cardiac arrest. There appears to be a profound loss of arterial vasomotor tone after prolonged arrest. This loss of vasomotor tone may make exogenous pressors necessary for resuscitation after prolonged cardiac arrest.", "prediction_text": "The use of exogenous epinephrine during aortic perfusion and oxygenation therapy (SAPO) may improve the efficacy of advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) by increasing aortic and coronary perfusion pressures, potentially leading to a higher rate of return of spontaneous circulation."}
{"answers": "In a leading specialty journal, cited reviewers gave higher scores than noncited reviewers. However, this\u00a0was likely due to their being assigned higher-quality manuscripts and not because they were cited in the manuscript. Reviewer requests that their work be cited were rare.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that reviewers may assign higher scores to manuscripts that cite their work, but the relationship was not significant after adjusting for manuscript quality. However, reviewers did suggest adding citations to their work more frequently than to others' work."}
{"answers": "Preoperative education delivered by nurses reduced anxiety and postoperative complications of patients undergoing cardiac surgery, but it was not effective in reducing readmissions or length of stay.", "prediction_text": "Yes, nurse-led preoperative education can reduce anxiety in cardiac surgery patients and may also decrease the incidence of chest infections. However, no significant difference was found in length of stay or readmission rates."}
{"answers": "Improving hospital efficiency by shortening length of stay does not appear to result in increased rates of readmission or numbers of physician visits within 30 days after discharge from hospital. Research is needed to identify optimal lengths of stay and expected readmission rates.", "prediction_text": "The study found that decreasing lengths of stay over time for selected diagnostic categories did not consistently correlate with increased readmission rates or mean number of physician visits after discharge. However, the readmission rate for uterine or adnexal procedures increased significantly in the second year but remained constant in the following years. No correlation was observed between length of stay and readmission rates or mean number of physician visits for individual hospitals in the studied categories."}
{"answers": "Solitary kidney in a canine model is more resistant to ischemia than paired kidneys based on radiological, pathological and genetic evidence.", "prediction_text": "Contrary to previous assumptions, the results of this study suggest that a solitary kidney may not be more resistant to ischemia compared to paired kidneys. Instead, the study found that the single kidney experienced less severe initial damage but a slower recovery process, with more sustained expression of proinflammatory markers."}
{"answers": "Elective re-siting of intravenous cannulae every 48 hours results in a significant reduction in the incidence and severity of PVT. We recommend that this should be adopted as standard practice in managing all patients who require prolonged intravenous therapy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, elective re-siting of intravenous cannulas every 48 hours decreases the incidence and severity of peripheral thrombophlebitis. The study showed that the incidence was significantly lower in the study group (2.4%) compared to the control group (100%), and the severity was also less in the study group. The majority (82.6%) of the episodes of PVT in the control group occurred on day 3."}
{"answers": "We conclude that 3-phase bone scintigraphy prior to surgery could be a useful method to determine the amputation level in a diabetic foot. We conclude that further, comparative, more comprehensive, long-term, and controlled studies are required.", "prediction_text": "The use of 3-phase bone scintigraphy in determining amputation levels in diabetic foot can be considered as an option, but it should be noted that it was not compared to other standard methods in this study. Therefore, it cannot be considered as a definitive guideline method yet. However, it can potentially reduce morbidity, mortality, and reamputation rates, and shorten the duration of hospitalization. Further studies with larger sample sizes and comparisons to other methods are needed to establish its role as a standard method."}
{"answers": "At baseline assessment patients of lower socioeconomic status showed lower health related quality of life. Since there was no clear trend at follow-up assessment this suggests that patients from different socioeconomic status responded to treatment similarly. In general, the findings suggest that quality of life is not only the outcome of the disease and its treatment, but is also highly dependent on each patients' socioeconomic characteristics.", "prediction_text": "At baseline, there is a correlation between lower socioeconomic status and poorer quality of life in lung cancer patients, specifically in areas of physical mobility, energy, role functioning, physical functioning, and breathlessness. However, no significant difference was observed between socioeconomic groups at the three-month follow-up assessment."}
{"answers": "General surgery research residents' intraoperative leadership skills showed significant correlations to their perceptions of skill decay and task difficulty during a bowel repair. Evaluating resident's directional instructions may provide an additional individualized intraoperative assessment metric. Further evaluation relating to operative performance outcomes is warranted.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that there is a relationship between general surgery residents' leadership skills, as indicated by the number of instructions given to their assistants during a simulated small bowel repair, and their perceived technical skill and difficulty in performing the task. However, more research is needed to establish a definitive correlation between these factors."}
{"answers": "The severity of TAI is influenced by the sharpness of the aortic arch. There is an inverse relationship between the severity of aortic injury and the aortic arch index.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the anatomy of the aortic arch, specifically the aortic arch angle, is associated with the severity of traumatic aortic injury. A larger aortic arch angle is linked to an increased risk of type III damage."}
{"answers": "Clinical variables, either isolated or as components of a model, could not identify all children with pathologic radiographs.", "prediction_text": "The study found that clinical variables, including clinical score, respiratory rate, and presence of rales, did not significantly differ between children with pathologic and nonpathologic radiographs during their first episode of wheezing. Pretreatment oxygen saturation was the only significant difference, but the discriminant analysis correctly predicted only 15% of pathologic radiographs. Therefore, clinical variables have limited predictive value for identifying pathologic radiographs in the first episode of wheezing."}
{"answers": "The results showed no overall first night effect on severity of RMMA frequency in young and healthy patients with SB. In clinical practice, one-night sleep recording may be sufficient for moderate-high frequency SB patients. However, low RMMA frequency in the first night could be confirmed by a second night based on the patient's medical and dental history.", "prediction_text": "The study found that sleep bruxism (SB) burst index, bruxism time index, and mean burst duration were significantly higher on the second night compared to the first night, while the episode index did not differ between the two nights. Some patients also showed a change in SB severity from low to moderate-high frequency on the second night."}
{"answers": "Athletes engaged in competitive sports are more likely to develop ventricular arrhythmias during exercise. These arrhythmias subside over time when athletes are engaged in non-competitive sports.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the number of ventricular arrhythmias in athletes tends to decrease over time. However, athletes with a history of ventricular arrhythmias may reach lower peak heart rates during follow-up exercise tests and engage in fewer competitive sports activities."}
{"answers": "A well developed collateral circulation does not predict an increased risk of restenosis after PCI.", "prediction_text": "Contrary to expectations, the presence of a well-developed collateral circulation did not increase the risk of restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention. Other factors such as stent diameter, stent length, residual stenosis, and smoking history were found to be predictive of restenosis."}
{"answers": "We conclude that patient and graft survival on transplanting kidneys from elderly donors to young recipients is superimposable on that obtained with young donors. However, renal function is better in the group of young donors.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that there are no significant differences in patient and graft survival or function between young recipients of kidneys from elderly donors and those from younger donors after 10 years of follow-up. However, there was a significant difference in creatinine levels, with higher levels in the elderly donor group. The decision to implant kidneys from elderly donors in young recipients should be individualized and take into account other factors, such as creatinine levels and potential immunological issues."}
{"answers": "Many patients do not understand their ED care or their discharge instructions. Moreover, most patients appear to be unaware of their lack of understanding and report inappropriate confidence in their comprehension and recall.", "prediction_text": "A significant number of patients demonstrated deficient comprehension of their ED care and instructions, but only a small percentage were aware of these deficiencies."}
{"answers": "The results of this study suggest that normothermic CPB does not prevent the development of the \"euthyroid sick syndrome\" during and after CPB. Despite these changes in thyroid function, most patients in both groups had a normal postoperative recovery.", "prediction_text": "The results of this study suggest that hypothermic and normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass temperatures have an effect on perioperative and postoperative thyroid function, with both groups experiencing reductions in TT4, TT3, and free T3, and elevations in rT3, indicating the presence of subclinical thyroid dysfunction, also known as the \"sick euthyroid syndrome.\" Therefore, the conclusion of the study is that cardiopulmonary bypass temperature does influence postoperative thyroid function."}
{"answers": "Severe hypoglycaemia is associated with an increased risk for CV outcomes in people at high CV risk and dysglycaemia. Although allocation to insulin glargine vs. standard care was associated with an increased risk of severe and non-severe hypoglycaemia, the relative risk of CV outcomes with hypoglycaemia was lower with insulin glargine-based glucose-lowering therapy than with the standard glycaemic control. Trial Registration (ORIGIN ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00069784).", "prediction_text": "Severe hypoglycaemia is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, including CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke, mortality, CV mortality, and arrhythmic death."}
{"answers": "EDWS is a safe and effective treatment for esophagogastric varices secondary to portal hypertension in selected patients. Patients treated with EDWS had a lower complication rate of portal venous system thrombosis compared with those treated with conventional MED.", "prediction_text": "Esophagogastric devascularization without splenectomy (EDWS) is a safe and effective alternative to modified esophagogastric devascularization (MED) with splenectomy for the treatment of portal hypertension. The study reports lower morbidity rate of portal venous system thrombosis in the EDWS group and similar recurrence rates of esophagogastric variceal hemorrhage in both groups."}
{"answers": "Significant postoperative pain can be expected in the following situations: pain after prior surgery, presence of chronic pain sustained for more than six months, intense preoperative pain, state of depression.", "prediction_text": "Yes, certain preoperative factors such as a prior history of surgical pain, duration and intensity of preoperative pain, and depression can be used to predict the intensity of postoperative pain."}
{"answers": "The general practice selection process is predictive of future performance in the MRCGP.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a statistically significant correlation between general practice selection scores and success in the MRCGP examinations, as indicated by the correlation coefficients of 0.491 for the applied knowledge test and 0.526 for the clinical skills assessment."}
{"answers": "Although the association of prostate and lung cancer is uncommon, the possibility of synchronous tumors should be considered in patients with urinary and pulmonary symptoms suggestive of neoplasm. It is important to determine if the lesion is a metastasis, since the prognosis depends on the second tumor.", "prediction_text": "The presence of both prostate and lung cancer does not necessarily indicate a causal relationship or a specific syndrome. These are two distinct diseases that can occur concurrently."}
{"answers": "The practice of intensive observation for the first transfusion in pediatric patients is probably unnecessary.", "prediction_text": "Based on the data from this study, intensive monitoring during the first transfusion in pediatric patients may not be necessary for all patients as only a small percentage (8.7%) experienced mild reactions during their first transfusion and none required ICU management. However, severe reactions (3.4%) can still occur during subsequent transfusions and may warrant intensive monitoring."}
{"answers": "There is no indication of a rebound aggravation of symptoms 12 to 14 days after a 5-day treatment with lansoprazole 60 mg once daily in patients with reflux symptoms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, this study suggests that short-term treatment with lansoprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, may cause a rebound aggravation of symptoms in some patients. However, the findings were not statistically significant for all symptom scores."}
{"answers": "Our long-term study showed significantly better (2-fold) results regarding the continence score for the abdominal approach compared with the transanal pull-through. The stool pattern and enterocolitis scores were somewhat better for the TERPT group. These findings raise an important issue about the current surgical management of HD; however, more cases will need to be studied before a definitive conclusion can be drawn.", "prediction_text": "The long-term outcomes of transanal endorectal pull-through (TERPT) and conventional transabdominal pull-through (ABD) for Hirschsprung disease (HD) are similar overall, but continence is better in the ABD group, and stool pattern is better in the TERPT group. The difference in age at interview between the two groups did not significantly affect the long-term scoring outcome."}
{"answers": "The current study revealed an increase in health care services utilization from 2001 to 2009 in the older Spanish population.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the prevalence of health care services use, specifically general practitioner visits, increased significantly among elderly people between the years 2001 and 2009."}
{"answers": "It is concluded from the study that this knowledge if applied to dead human subjects, may preserve dead bodies temporarily allowing delayed funeral.", "prediction_text": "Yes, Raksi, a homemade alcohol, can be temporarily used for preserving dead bodies due to its preservative, bactericidal, and disinfectant properties. It can effectively arrest postmortem changes for up to 72 hours."}
{"answers": "The Holmium:YAG laser is an ideal intracorporeal lithotripter for ureteral calculi, with a high success rate and low morbidity.", "prediction_text": "Holmium:YAG laser lithotripsy is an effective and relatively safe modality for treating ureteral stones, with a high success rate and low complication rate. However, it is not definitively the best intracorporeal lithotripter for the ureter as other modalities may also have their advantages and limitations. The choice of lithotripter depends on various factors including stone location, size, and patient-specific factors."}
{"answers": "Our results suggested that s.c. anti-TNF pharmacokinetics do not significantly influence US-scored synovitis in RA patients.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find a significant correlation between the ultrasound-scored synovitis and the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous anti-TNF agents in patients with rheumatoid arthritis."}
