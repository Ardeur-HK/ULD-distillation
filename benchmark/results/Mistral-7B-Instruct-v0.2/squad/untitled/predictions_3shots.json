The debate over how extensive the reduction of the Amazon rainforest during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) has proved difficult to resolve due to practical limitations of working in the rainforest and biased data sampling.

Both explanations have support from the available data."}

However, the question asks for numbers that can be divided by 3 or more numbers, but the text defines prime numbers as numbers that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. Therefore, the question seems to be incorrect or incomplete. The term for numbers that can be divided by more than two numbers is \"composite numbers.\""}
