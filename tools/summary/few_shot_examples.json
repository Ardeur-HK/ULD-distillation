Anyway,I'm not carrying this one to Mary's wedding.#Person2#: But, Jane, why not rent one with Handbag Hire? Instead of $ 990,pay $ 50,and you have it for a whole week.#Person1#: Sounds great, but I never knew I can rent a handbag.#Person2#: Handbag Hire is a new business. It was founded two months ago. Its collection covers many designer handbags.#Person1#: So... for the price of one Murrberry, I can use a different bag each week for twenty weeks?#Person2#: Absolutely. And if you like one of them, you can choose to buy it at a discounted rate. Of course the price varies by age and condition. For example, a $ 1500 Murrberry bag can sell for just $750.#Person1#: Great, but how do I rent? By telephone? Or in person?#Person2#: Either. And more conveniently, it accepts online orders.#Person1#: I'll do it on line now. I still have one more question. Mary's wedding is next Saturday. There are only five days left. Do I have enough time?#Person2#: Don't worry. It promises that customers receive their orders by post within two days. Three more days to go.#Person1#: Oh, I'd better order one right now.",

Of course you can also call Miss Childs too.#Person2#: Great. Rmm, when can I expect to hear from you?#Person1#: Well, we are finishing the shortlist interviews tomorrow, so we will certainly have a decision made by early next week. Miss Childs will call you to discuss more on Monday or Tuesday. How does that so#Person2#: That sounds perfect. Thank you very much for taking the time to speak to me Mr. Parsons.#Person1#: The pleasure's all mine, Rebecca.#Person2#: I hope to hear from you very soon.#Person1#: Absolutely.

I can't wait for all the adventures we're going to have, for all the fights and the laughter. I can't wait to grow old and wrinkly with you.#Person2#: Oh, Jared! I can't wait for our wedding! I hope you don't mind, but I'Ve already chosen a date! Six months from now in the summer! Melissa saw you buying the ring last month so I'Ve had plenty of time to start planning!#Person1#: She what?#Person2#: Oh don't worry, sweetie, I didn't know when you were going to propose. It was still a nice surprise! As I was saying, I'Ve got it all planned out. There's almost nothing left to do! I wrote up our guest list and we will have roughly four hundred guests attending.#Person1#: Four hundred?#Person2#: No need to sweat it. My parents agreed to pay for most of the wedding, which is going to be low-budget anyway. So roughly four hundred people, which means that the hall at Northwoods Heights will be our reception venue. I thought it would be nice if we had the wedding at your parents'church and my uncle of course would be officiating. We'll meet with him soon for some pre-wedding counseling. The music for the wedding ceremony was a no-brainer. My step-sister and her string quartet will take care of that. My cousin will be the official photographer. I thought it would also be nice if his daughter could sing a solo. Did you know that she's going to be a professional opera singer?#Person1#: Ah. . .#Person2#: And then of course the ladies at the church would love to be our caterers for the banquet and we'll get the Youth Group to serve us. I was thinking that your friend's band could be our entertainment for the night. though they might have to tone it down a bit. Or we could hire a DJ. Your sister's husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings. what's their name again? I was thinking that we could have an island paradise-themed wedding and our theme color would be a soothing blue like Aquamarine. And there will be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where we'll make our toasts! What do you think of small packages of drink mixes for our wedding favors? Who else am I missing? Oh, your uncle could be our florist and his wife could make our wedding cake!#Person1#: Wow.#Person2#: See? It's going to be wonderful! Oh this wedding is going to be everything I ever dreamed of.#Person1#: If I survive the next six months.",

Shall we take a walk around the pond or into those woods for a while?#Person1#: Let's do both! Are we in a rush or anything#Person2#: No, not really. I had thought we'd stay in Hamburg tonight, but we can't unless we rush it. Let's stay in Bremen instead. Tomorrow we can have lunch in Hamburg, then check into a hostel in Copenhagen and have dinner there.#Person1#: Sounds fine to me. Whatever, let's enjoy this pond first.#Person2#: Sure. We can walk around to that path that leads into the woods there. Hey, look! There are some wild ducks over there in the reeds.#Person1#: I see them! Wow! How do you know they're wild?#Person2#: I used to go hunting with my uncle, that's how.#Person1#: They're neat. Now Let's take that path into the woods and see what we can see. . .",
